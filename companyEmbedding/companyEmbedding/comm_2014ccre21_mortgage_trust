Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit.

You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority.

For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE21 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms COMM 2014-CCRE21
    





December 01, 2016 10:41 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE21 Mortgage Trust pass-through certificates. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable 
      performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, 
      therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the 
      transaction.
    

      As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 1.1% to $815.8 million from $824.8 
      million at issuance. Currently there are no delinquent, specially 
      serviced or defeased loans. Two loans, Boulevard (1.3% of the pool) and 
      Harding Avenue Surfside (0.4%), are on the servicer watchlist due to 
      deferred maintenance and performance falling below issuance 
      expectations, respectively. Fitch is monitoring the performance of these 
      two loans.
    

      Stable Performance: The overall pool performance since issuance has been 
      stable and there has been no material change in pool expected losses.
    

      Limited amortization: This transaction has limited amortization due to 
      high interest-only loan concentration - 33.1% of the pool is full-term 
      interest only and 34.9% is partial interest only.
    

      Property Type Concentration: The transaction has high hotel (22% of the 
      pool) and multifamily (26%) exposure.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$21 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$407 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52.6 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37.1 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40.2 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8.2 million class E at 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --Interest Only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest Only class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest Only class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the classes F, G, H and J, or Interest-Only classes 
      X-D, X-E and X-F certificates.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to

Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE21 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through Ctfs; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate COMM 2014-CCRE21 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Ctfs; Presale Issued
    





December 05, 2014 02:05 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on Deutsche Bank Securities, 
      Inc.'s COMM 2014-CCRE21 Commercial Mortgage Trust Pass-Through 
      Certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$30,000,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,176,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,250,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$185,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$221,965,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$629,974,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$52,583,000b class A-M 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$46,398,000b class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$136,099,000b class PEZ 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37,118,000b class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$85,516,000ac class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,211,000ac class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,211,000c class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,248,000c class E 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      (b) Class A-M, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-M, 
      B, and C certificates.
    

      (c) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Dec. 4, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $27,839,000 
      interest-only class X-D, the $18,559,000 interest-only class X-E, the 
      $24,745,357 interest-only class X-F, the $19,591,000 class F, the 
      $10,310,000 class G, the $8,249,000 class H, or the $24,745,357 class J 
      certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 59 loans secured by 79 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $824.8 
      million, as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      Lending, L.P., KeyBank National Association, Natixis Real Estate Capital 
      LLC, UBS Real Estate Securities, Inc., and Pillar Funding LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 58.2% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 82.9%, and asset summary reviews on 82.9% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other 
      recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.17x is 
      slightly below the first-half 2014 average of 1.19x. The pool's Fitch 
      LTV of 111.0% exceeds the first-half 2014 average of 105.6%.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by only 9.8% of 
      the initial pool balance prior to maturity. Ten loans (32.7%), including 
      four of the top 10 loans, are full-term interest only (IO), and 21 loans 
      (34.6%) are partial IO. Fitch-rated transactions in the first half of 
      2014 had an average full-term IO percentage of 18.3% and a partial IO 
      percentage of 37.8%.
    

      High Hotel and Multifamily Concentration: Hotel properties comprise 
      19.8% of the pool, which is greater than the 2013 and first-half 2014 
      averages of 14.7% and 13.3%, respectively. Multifamily properties 
      comprise of 25.6% of the pool, which is greater than the 2013 and 
      first-half 2014 averages of 17.2% and 12.1%, respectively. Hotels have 
      the highest probability of default in Fitch's multiborrower model, 
      whereas multifamily properties have the lowest probability of default in 
      Fitch's multiborrower model.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 17.2% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 2014-CCRE21 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays slightly above 
      average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which 
      NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBBsf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 68 - 69.
    

      The master servicer will be Midland Loan Services, a Division of PNC 
      Bank, National Association, rated 'CMS1' by Fitch. The special servicer 
      will be LNR Partners, LLC, rated 'CSS1-'.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to overall stable performance. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction.As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1.1% to $815.8 million from $824.8 million at issuance. Currently there are no delinquent, specially serviced or defeased loans. Two loans, Boulevard (1.3% of the pool) and Harding Avenue Surfside (0.4%), are on the servicer watchlist due to deferred maintenance and performance falling below issuance expectations, respectively. Fitch is monitoring the performance of these two loans.Stable Performance: The overall pool performance since issuance has been stable and there has been no material change in pool expected losses.Limited amortization: This transaction has limited amortization due to high interest-only loan concentration - 33.1% of the pool is full-term interest only and 34.9% is partial interest only.Property Type Concentration: The transaction has high hotel (22% of the pool) and multifamily (26%) exposure.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--$21 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$91.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$49.3 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$407 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$52.6 million class A-M at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$46.4 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$0 class PEZ at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$37.1 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$40.2 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$8.2 million class E at 'BB+sf'; Outlook Stable.--Interest Only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest Only class X-B 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest Only class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable.Fitch does not rate the classes F, G, H and J, or Interest-Only classes X-D, X-E and X-F certificates.Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance Criteria (pub. 11 Nov 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889634Related ResearchCOMM 2014-CCRE21 Mortgage Trust -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/863230Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1015650Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1015650Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
