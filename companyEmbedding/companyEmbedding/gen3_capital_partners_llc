Jim Coleman’s professional background includes over 30 years of entrepreneurial, operational and M&A experience. His career began at Coleman Cable Systems based in North Chicago, Illinois, where he transformed the company from a $2 million a year distributor of surplus wire to a prime manufacturer of an array of products with over $200 million in revenues. In 1990, Mr. Coleman led the sale of the company to private equity firm Code, Hennessy and Simmons and remained on as chief executive officer. Three years later, the company was again sold to Kuhlman Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange listed company. Coleman Cable (NASDAQ: CCIX) currently has revenues exceeding $1 Billion.In 1996, a year after leaving Coleman Cable, Mr. Coleman founded Genesis Cable Systems, a manufacturer of cables for security, fire, video, sound, voice and data. Genesis manufactured its products from a state-of-the-art facility located in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. During the period from
1997 to 2004, Mr. Coleman served as Genesis’ chief executive officer and company sales grew to $83 million. In July of 2004, Honeywell International acquired Genesis. By the end of 2007, Genesis had revenues of $215 million.Following the sale of Genesis to Honeywell, in addition to his continuing involvement in the management of Genesis, Mr. Coleman served in Honeywell’s business development group where he assisted in numerous acquisitions, restructurings and integrations, including the $2.1 billion Novar transaction. In 2007, Mr. Coleman was named global head of business development for Honeywell Security.Mr. Coleman currently serves on the boards of the Children’s Brittle Bone Foundation and Rush North Shore Medical Center.






David Coleman graduated from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 2003 with a Bachelor of General Studies. He then spent the next five years with Honeywell International holding several positions in sales and marketing, most recently serving as the Global Director of Custom Electronics. During his tenure Mr. Coleman brought award-winning technologies to market by leading the collaboration of businesses inside and outside of Honeywell and expanded sales distribution into new sales channels and markets.
Mr. Coleman works with the portfolio companies’ product development, sales and marketing teams.Mr. Coleman currently serves as the President of the Children’s Brittle Bone Foundation.






Brandon Nagler started his career as a clerk in the Nasdaq 100 futures pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Soon after, he began trading stock equity index futures in the early stages of the CME’s Globex computerized trading platform. After a 7 year trading career, Mr. Nagler co-founded Generation3 Capital, LLC.
Mr. Nagler is involved in all aspects of Gen3’s operations, including investment strategy, deal sourcing, due diligence, financial modeling, and transaction structuring.






Bill Vranek has enjoyed a 20-plus year relationship with Mr. Coleman in successfully starting, growing and selling companies. They first teamed up in 1984, when Mr. Vranek joined Coleman Cable as controller. He was promoted to chief financial officer in 1990, and he served in that role until the sale of Coleman Cable, after which he joined Genesis in dual capacities as chief financial officer and chief operating officer. After the sale of Genesis to Honeywell, Mr. Vranek continued at Genesis as director of operations, in which capacity he assisted with due diligence and integration for several successful follow-on acquisitions by Honeywell.
Mr. Vranek will be involved in all aspects of Gen3’s activities, including due diligence and as operations leader for the Partnership’s portfolio companies.
