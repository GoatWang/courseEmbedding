VALVE APPLICATIONS >>




Emerging applications:

 
ISOTOPESYNTHESIS >>

Much of the equipment created for the synthesis of F18, N13, O15, and C11 utilizes off-the-shelf 
									components from our product lines.
								





 
BEAD FLOWCYTOMETRY >>

Many of our standard products for liquid handling are ideal off-the-shelf components for 
									automated sample preparation, handling, mixing, and delivery.
								





 
PROTEOMICSRESEARCH >>

VICI valves, tubing, and fittings can radically reduce the time required for the 
								incredibly complex separations involved in proteomics research. 
								





 
LIQUIDBRACHYTHERAPY >>

Valco Instruments is partnering with The Gabriel Institute and 
								IsoTherapeutics Group, LLC to pursue pioneering work in the direct administration of therapeutic isotopes into tumors.
