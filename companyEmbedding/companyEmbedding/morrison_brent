Consumers see product placement as positive if they have positive feelings towards the products displayed. Audience characteristicsOur perception of product placement depends on whether we value others' opinions. Consumers buy products because they are convinced others care more about brands than they themselves do (Persaud, 2007).ConclusionBibliographyOnline resources: http://blogs.wsj.com/tech-europe/2011/08/16/digital-technology-and-the-re-birth-of-product-placement/http://www.lfpress.com/2012/09/21/are-you-persuaded-by-product-placementhttp://www.brandhype.org/Effect on memoryAttitude towards placements and brandsProminent placements are distracting, interfere with the plot and make it less realistic (Homer, 2009)Character AssociationParasocial theoryN=1065   I-Research Consulting Group  2010.10Increase in product placement can be linked to decline in efficacy of traditional advertising forms.Marketers use product placement to increase brand awareness and exposure. Films and TV offer a more realistic setting, where brands can be more subtly contextualised.Product placement's effectiveness: more effective if 'audio-visual' and prominent but not aggressive, but perceptions differ from person to person.Saturation of product placement could result in negative perceptions of it in the future.Potential for positive future growth through techniques such as digital insertion, however, there is a fine line to be drawn between excessive and effective placements.Perception continued..It can be seen as ethically unacceptable.Persuasion knowledge1896, Sunlight Soap advertised in Défilé du 8eme Bataillon1931, Wrigley's P.K Chewing Gum advertised in M1946, National Geographic advertised in 'Its A Wonderful Life'1953, Vespa advertised in 'Roman Holiday'1980, E.T advertised Reese's Pieces ChocolateHershey sponsored $1 million worth of advertising Reese’s Pieces sales of chocolate consequently rose by 80%Caused a shift in industry revenue models (Antonopoulou, 2010).Harry SparkesRita KoCamilla RouseKate RobartsConcern for ethically charged products such as guns, alcohol and cigarettes rather than soft drinks, food or clothing (Gupta and Gould, 1997).Excessive commercializationIncrease in reality or invasion of privacy?
