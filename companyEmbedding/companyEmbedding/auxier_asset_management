At Auxier…
Jeff Auxier, President and Chief Executive Officer of Auxier Asset Management and the Auxier Focus Fund
We believe the power of compounding is the most underappreciated and valuable investment concept.  A dedicated, diligent research effort is the key to seeking high compounded portfolio returns.  Our unique advantage comes from the wisdom of managing portfolios in every kind of market for over 30 years.  We strive to maintain an intense work ethic with the goal of mastering the principals of capital allocation.



 
 
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is in the prospectus, a copy of which may be obtained by clicking here or by calling (877) 328-9437. Please read the prospectus carefully before you invest.
The Fund may invest in value stocks, which are subject to risk that their intrinsic value may never be realized, and growth stocks, which may be susceptible to rapid price swings. Investments in mid-sized companies generally carry greater risk than is customarily associated with larger companies. Moreover, if the Fund’s portfolio is overweighed in a sector, any negative development affecting that sector will have a greater impact on the Fund than a fund that is not overweighed in that sector. An increase in interest rates typically causes a fall in the value of a debt security (Fixed-Income Securities Risk) with corresponding changes to the Fund’s value. Foreign securities are subject to additional risks including international trade, currency, political, regulatory and diplomatic risks.

J. Jeffrey Auxier
President and Chief Executive Officer Auxier Asset Management/Auxier Focus Fund
In an era where the experience of many fund managers is just 5 years, Jeff Auxier offers his clients a 30 year record of performance, a seasoned perspective on every market bump and bubble, a passion for research, and an unprecedented devotion to “eating his own cooking”. That record includes serving as Sr. Portfolio Manager for Smith Barney where he created a business model that demanded higher levels of accountability to investors. He has earned national awards and recognitions for performance and “integrity, knowledge and commitment.” Jeff founded and manages the Auxier Focus Fund.
Jeff began lessons in finance early–at age 11, mowing the lawn of Robert Pamplin Senior the former long-time CEO of Georgia Pacific and recipient of the “World’s Top CEO Award”. Mr. Pamplin tutored Jeff on living a life of ethics. As Jeff puts it, “Mr. Pamplin always put his shareholders first and believed business should be transparent. He said the language of business is accounting, and that if you can’t speak the language, you can’t make money.” In 1981, Jeff graduated with honors from the University of Oregon with a degree in Finance and an emphasis on accounting. Immediately, Jeff began calling or personally meeting with some of his investment heroes, long before they became today’s financial rock stars. Names like Warren Buffett. Not yet known as the Oracle of Omaha, Mr. Buffett graciously took several of Jeff’s calls and offered advice, most notably, “Number one don’t lose your principal and number two, never violate the first rule.” To this day, the cornerstone of the Auxier Focus Fund is respect for the power of compounding.
Jeff began his professional career in 1982, at Foster Marshall-American Express (now Smith Barney) in Portland, Oregon. Jeff connected with “value investing” but found the retail brokerage business a challenging environment in which to encourage investors to buy businesses Wall Street despised. So in the late 1980’s Jeff helped Smith Barney create the Portfolio Management Advisory Board. Along with Jamie Dimon—now CEO of JP Morgan Chase—Jeff and other executives formed policies aimed at better serving client interests. “We wanted high levels of disclosure, reasonable fees and no broker compensation for trading the portfolio,” says Jeff. Jeff also served as a member of the Chairman’s Council from 1990 to 1996 and Senior Vice President of Investments and Senior Portfolio Management Director. In 1993, Jeff was awarded the Consulting Group Bob Dwyer Award, which honors the Portfolio Manager whose “integrity, knowledge and commitment to the discipline of investment management exemplifies the highest standards.” In a national competition pitting some of the nation’s top performers against each other, Money magazine named Jeff their “All-Star Broker”, two years in a row (1997/1998.)
In 1998, Jeff realized his professional dream. He left Smith Barney to start his own investment advisory, Auxier Asset Management and, in 1999, the Auxier Focus Fund. From the start, Jeff wanted a fund where the manager is held highly accountable, so he committed to remaining one of the Auxier Focus Fund’s largest shareholders. How many managers invest their entire personal retirement into their own Fund? In Jeff’s case, that’s over 166,000 shares, right on the line with his investors. Jeff instituted company policy that he will not sell a single share while still manager. In addition, his family’s assets are included in the money management portion of Auxier Asset Management. Jeff volunteers GIPS® compliant numbers showing performance back to 1989. And members of the Auxier Asset Mgt. Team also have large percentages of their own personal net worth invested in the Auxier Focus Fund. The small, long-time staff enjoys a “nearly never” meetings policy, instead focusing on aggressive, fundamental research. “Everyone here is focused on performance,” says Jeff. “We’ve all got our own money on the line.”
You don’t survive 25 years in portfolio management and research analysis without a passionate love for research. “We are 90% research, 10% trading. Most investors work the opposite,” says Jeff, who happily devours numbers, spending 8-10 hours each day scrutinizing 20-40 companies per week. He pours over annual reports, trade journals, investment publications, tracking quarterly conference calls, reports and evaluating competitive threats to each franchise. Stocks are aggressively monitored. Says Jeff, “This daily grind-it-out research helped us sail right around the Enron hurricane. Early on we saw that management claims, didn’t square with the numbers. We discovered a balance sheet debt that was completely hidden to most investors. We sold and made money off Enron.” Jeff doesn’t focus on economic trends—as he puts it the “unknowable”—rather crunching through numbers to unearth outstanding companies that have been knocked down with a temporary problem. You can’t predict the future, but you can analyze and discover exemplary companies.
Since 2008 Jeff has served on the Board of Directors for Colorado based eBags, whom he has helped guide to being the #1 bag retailer in the United States.
Jeff, his wife and four children deliberately live far from the wilds of Wall Street, on a 108 acre farm just outside of Portland, Oregon and just west of the end of the Oregon Trail. Nursery stock, timber and hazelnuts grow abundantly on the fertile hillsides in a valley where 90 percent of the nation’s hazelnut crop is harvested. In the fall of 2006 Jeff harvested a record 90 tons of hazelnuts from his farm. When he’s not researching, you may find Jeff clearing land on his 43- thousand pound Caterpillar D6-C bulldozer or scanning his favorite non-financial website, Bulldozer.com. Jeff also conducts research from his 2,000-acre ranch in the high desert of Central Oregon where antelope, cougar, wild boar, rattlesnakes and coyotes share the wide-open space. Jeff sees similarities in investing on Wall Street and his life on the farm and ranch. “All take extremely hard work and involve consideration of price, value, margin of safety and wise allocation of capital. This lifestyle keeps you humble and focused on the rewards of hard work,” says Jeff. “I’m far from the greed and emotion of Wall Street and able to conduct the kind of independent thinking that keeps us ahead of the pack, not chasing it. I love my job and consider it a stewardship of other people’s hard-earned money. I want to do this the rest of my life.”

Our philosophy is based on the conviction that compounding is the most influential element of an investment program. We believe leading companies in slow growth industries often achieve the best performance over the long-term investment horizon. We look for value with a significant margin of safety relative to price. We continue to believe in a price/value strategy that helps eliminate emotional reaction to market panics.

Investment Philosophy



We believe the power of compounding is the most valuable and underappreciated investment concept. Our respect for compounding leads us to have a strong aversion to permanent capital loss (although there can never be assurance that any portfolio holdings will not decline in value). We first look at the downside risk of any investment before looking at the upside potential. A dedicated, diligent research effort is the key to seeking high compounded portfolio returns. Our unique advantage comes from the wisdom of managing individual portfolios in every kind of market for over 30 years. We strive to maintain an intense work ethic with the goal of mastering the principals of capital allocation.
It is imperative for an investor to study history and past market behavior in an effort to avoid repeating costly mistakes. The firm’s founder, Jeff Auxier, spends 8 – 10 hours daily researching annual reports, trade journals and investment publications. We evaluate domestic and international companies traded on the major exchanges using a value-oriented approach. Each individual holding is constantly monitored and the operating fundamentals scrutinized. We aim to think independently and rationally. We are skeptical of conventional wisdom. The proper temperament, humility and emotional control are critical. We dig to find compelling, undervalued companies that ideally exhibit the following attributes:

Strong or improving fundamentals
Consistency in operating results
A substantial advantage over competition (strong franchise)
A demonstrated ability to earn high rates of return on capital
Understandable products
Honest, competent shareholder-oriented management
Intelligent capital allocation policies
Generates substantial free cash flow with nominal mandatory capital requirements
A strong balance sheet and financial flexibility

The investment candidates are then screened to determine what price represents good value with acceptable, low risk and the potential for above average returns. One of the chief investment sins is overpayment. We count on exceptional investment selection for our returns, not the market.
During the research process and monitoring of portfolio positions we will:

Look at each company as if we are going to buy the entire enterprise. Compare the price to private market values and the present value of future cash flows.
Look at each individual security on its own merits and weigh positions based on where the widest gap between price and value exists.
Watch for floods of “easy money” (IPOs) coming into an industry as a warning signal.
Lighten up:

If the fundamentals deteriorate
If “bubble” conditions lead to inflated valuations
If a company’s management loses their focus, consistently fails to execute, or misallocates capital


Avoid stocks that are highly valued, have high expectations and are vulnerable to severe drops on minor disappointments. These we call “torpedo stocks” and they destroy the compounding effect.

On each stock, we look to make money from the company’s growth in earnings and intrinsic value, together with an upward revaluation by the market. We theoretically will hold a company indefinitely if the operating fundamentals continue to improve and the price is reasonable.
Typical Situations
Our goal in managing portfolios is to significantly outperform the S&P 500 Index over the long-term, while taking far less risk (as measured by the beta statistic— volatility measurement relative to the S&P 500 Index). The ideal investment scenario is one where we have a very high quality, high return business with exceptional management, selling at wash-out, bargain prices. We also look to invest in businesses whose sales and profits are progressing at a sustainable rate and whose price is low due to misperceptions surrounding the true facts and fundamentals. We are always weighing the odds to ensure the potential rewards more than compensate for the level of risk. A stagnant price is normal and welcome while we are buying. As overall market levels become risky and overvalued, we then look for the “work-outs” that often can provide positive returns but shield us from sharp market declines. Rising prices lead to a more defensive posture.
Work-outs
To attempt to add stability and predictability to returns we will typically have a portion of the portfolio in securities that have a timetable. These are called “workouts” and are dependent upon a corporate driven event or catalyst, as opposed to the supply and demand of the auction markets. Work-outs can arise from reorganizations, mergers, split-offs, spin-offs, sell-outs, etc. While these can be very rewarding in flat-to-down markets, they can penalize returns in a strong up market. Over the past two years, this category has included corporate debt and preferred stock. As corporations over borrowed in the boom times, balance sheets suffered. This led to urgent actions to reduce debt to the benefit of bondholders.
Conditions We Thrive In
The ideal investment climate to allocate capital and identify significantly undervalued securities is one where the headlines are negative, fear and panic abound, and emotions are running high. Extreme volatility usually follows and can lead to exploitable misappraisals. As US financier and Presidential advisor, Bernard Baruch used to say, facts are facts even in the height of emotion. Often in these periods what is perceived to be risky is far safer than normal. Like John Train, author of The Money Masters has said, “The safe time to invest is when investors are discouraged and desperate.” Conversely, the time to be cautious is when everyone is excited, news is good, and initial public offerings are flowing.

FAQ



Where do I send my check and to whom do I make it payable to?
Always send deposits to the custodian of your account. Always make checks payable to the custodian and reference your account number.
Who do I call to transfer funds?
Your custodian. As a Registered Investment Adviser we do not maintain custody of your assets. Fund transfers must be requested to your custodian.
How do you justify your fee?

Our clients have access to 28 years of investment research experience
Your account is reviewed on a regular basis with performance in mind
We tailor the account to your objectives as they change
Pressure to meet performance goals
Our client service is customized to fit your needs
Our goal is to get you to the finish line

Why is low turnover advantageous to my portfolio?

We believe that actively trading your account leads to more commissions, and often, greater tax bills
We believe there are not enough great companies out there to be buying and selling on a regular basis
We believe that when you buy a stock you should become an owner of the company and not a trader

What are the advantages of a focus fund?

Your portfolio is concentrated in the sectors that, in our opinion, offer the best risk/reward ratio
The manager has 30-40 stocks to monitor closely in lieu of 500
Your portfolio does not look like the market

What is the difference between a Broker-Dealer and a Registered Investment Adviser?
Broker:

May need your permission for each buy and sell
Commission paid for every transaction

Registered Investment Adviser:

Has discretion to buy and sell, so swift action may be taken whenever deemed appropriate
Fee is based on a percent of market value which is an incentive to grow the value of the account through increased performance
Benefit of constant monitoring to improve value of account
Personalized research for each account

GuruFocus Interview: Jeff Auxier of Auxier Asset ManagementHomeMailFlickrTumblrNewsSportsFinanceCelebrityAnswersGroupsMobileMoreTry Yahoo Finance on Firefox »YahooSearchSearchSign inU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,472.54-0.91 (-0.04%)Dow 3021,580.07-31.71 (-0.15%)Nasdaq6,387.75-2.25 (-0.04%)LISTENAetna's CEO Mark Bertolini on the future of the health care systemBertolini shares how a life-threatening injury shaped his views on health care.GuruFocus Interview: Jeff Auxier of Auxier Asset ManagementGuruFocus.comAugust 6, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareAt 11 years old, Jeff Auxier (Trades, Portfolio) began mowing the lawn of Georgia Pacific's then-CEO Bob Pamplin, who led the company to be one of the top-performing NYSE stocks of the time. After graduating college with his degree in finance and starting his career in 1982, Auxier decided to cold call Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) - and got an answer.Jeff Auxier Stock PicksJeff Auxier Current PortfolioThis Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 YearsWhether by luck or simply taking a chance, Auxier was influenced by value investors from an early age, and this is reflected in his firm, Auxier Asset Management. The firm is based far from Wall Street on the opposite coast in Portland, Oregon, where Auxier lives on a 108-acre hazelnut farm.The distance from the noise of Wall Street may help explain the Auxier Focus Fund's results. Since its inception in 1999, the fund had average annual total returns of 7.29%, compared with the S&P 500's 4.39% over the same time period.Three years after GuruFocus first spoke with Auxier, he joined us again to answer questions from readers about topics as varied as the Greek debt crisis, to his notable investing missteps. GuruFocus: When you spoke with us back in 2012, you mentioned that Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) and former Georgia Pacific CEO Bob Pamplin both had an influence on you when you were younger. Are there any other investors who have influenced your investing philosophy?Jeff Auxier (Trades, Portfolio): Other than Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), I would say Lou Simpson (Trades, Portfolio), who was really generous with his time with me back in the mid-80s, as well as Henry Berghoef who used to work with Lou at GEICO. Henry went on to become the head of research at Oakmark. Don Yacktman, of course, was also an important influence. I've been attracted to investors who like high return businesses because we're interested in buying outstanding franchises at bargain prices. For instance, Lou Simpson (Trades, Portfolio) is more of a higher return business type of investor. Those were two who were very helpful as I was starting my career.Over time, would you say your strategy has evolved in order to fit your strengths or your weaknesses?It's evolved to having more of a respect for thorough day-to-day research effort. Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) talks about reading 500 pages a day - but that's aspirational. We can't do that every day. From a risk management stand point, I think the evolution involves the humility to do that original research every day. If you have a good year or a good period, it's possible to become complacent. You have to look back at the history for your mistakes and omissions you've made of great companies. We had some Costco (COST) at about 17 cents and Precision Castparts (PCP) for 60 cents or a dollar, and we just think "Why weren't we buying more of these really great businesses?" The evolution is you have to have the humility to know that in the markets, anything can happen. We also have to remember that stocks are businesses; there's always a business behind it, and you have to focus on the operating realities of the business and not get too caught up in watching the stock or the economy. We want to look at those operating fundamentals every day and make sure we're doing that day-to-day intense research.Following up on all of that research, what are some of your top criteria in determining whether a company is high value?I've learned over time that you need to look at the entire company. You just can't look at a PE ratio or price over sales. We're looking for something that can endure through thick and thin; our focus really is on high compounded rates of return, and to do that, you're looking for enduring businesses that have a lot of repeat. We've tended over the years to be a little more concentrated in industries like beverages and other lower ticket items, because to endure through depression and high inflation, you want businesses that are somewhat capital light. In other words, they don't have huge mandatory capital spending. Those tend to do better in high inflation times but also have the financial flexibility to get through depressions as well.So, we look back over 200 years and see which types of businesses and balance sheets are necessary to endure. But, again, that's constantly changing and we're running into problems of abundance. We're getting so good at producing that we can immediately oversupply any kind of product. We're looking for businesses with inspired management in the uninspiring industry, so they're not magnets for huge supply. That's why technology has been so dangerous, because it can change and become obsolete very quickly. You're also competing with the smartest brains in the world on that stage.Read MoreWe tend to look for exceptional businesses that are not in the limelight. You look and see what's going on in today's economy: the sharing economy with Airbnb and the destruction with Uber; there's a lot of destructive technology. We'd rather have the business that can benefit from lower technology. For example, personal computer prices since 1980 are down over 99%, and there were over 30 IPOs in 1983 involving personal computers. They're virtually all gone. The enduring nature of that transfer is not as easy as you would think, because the nature of this exponential world we're living in in terms of exponential data can create huge issues of supply, which can really destroy pricing.As you mentioned, beverages is one of the industries you're concentrated in. As a long-time PepsiCo (PEP) investor, what are your thoughts on the breakup of the snacks and beverage businesses that some investors are pushing for? Do you see a rationale for breaking up the businesses?We like breakups and split-ups, and we've done very well with them over the years. We had Dr. Pepper (DPS), and when they spun off Cadbury, they became highly energetic, even though they were in the soda market which was flat at the time. But we like smaller names that are re-energized. With big conglomerates, the heart and soul of the business can be dimmed down. We've been in Pepsi since 1983, even when they had the Mexican accounting scandal. Then they spun out Yum! (YUM), which has been a tremendous investment out of Pepsi. So yes, we're all for the split-up, because when you're energizing and people own something, there's just a different mentality.Years ago, Dun & Bradstreet (DNB) stock was stuck flat for maybe 10 years, and they spun out Cognizant and Moody's. If you bought it on the spin, you made over 200% over the next six years on that group. We're a big advocate of a really well-nurtured business that's taken care of over the long haul. The smaller spin-offs are where you get your bigger gains.Discovery Communications (DISCA) was your new holding during the first quarter; what's your investment thesis here?We've been investing with (director of Discovery Communications) John Malone for many, many years. There's a dirth of great content which Discovery owns, and they are global. They're in 20 countries and 40 languages, and they have over 2.5 billion viewers. They're down right now because many millennials are just watching on their mobile devices and getting away from television. With the ad model, that's a problem. But what we're doing there is looking for the content cheap or cheaper. And we think John Malone will consolidate that industry just like he consolidated the cable industry. In the mean time, you have enormous free cash, and it's one of those businesses that can replay content over and over.Another one of your large holdings is Kroger (KR). What sets Kroger apart from other grocery store chains in the market?We've been in Kroger for over 30 years. Kroger, when we went into it, was around $18-21, and the issue was they were going to go up against Walmart (WMT). People thought they'd never be able to compete against Walmart. Well, they went up against Walmart, they kept their prices to match Walmart, and they really pushed private label products and added more in organics. The concept of one-stop shopping is if you get your prices low enough, people will want to shop in one location instead of going to Trader Joe's or Aldi. It's been a story of great execution and it's very shareholder friendly. If people are going to the grocery store a couple of times a week, there will be high inventory turnovers, and that's the quality of a really good business. They compete not only on price, but tremendous value and selection, and have a management that's extremely focused on the business.This question is from one of our readers about the situation in Greece. Do you think the fear in the markets is justified considering Greece makes up such as small percentage of Europe's GDP? Should investors consider rebalancing their portfolio, and is this currently affecting your holdings, if at all?When you dig down into the fundamentals, Greece is only 11 million in population and is $320-350 billion in debt. It's about the size of maybe Alabama or Wisconsin's economy. They got into the European Union through creative derivatives, so they never had the balance sheet to enter. To me, Greece is an excitable problem that creates opportunity to buy quality in Europe. But you want to focus on China, India, and the U.S. - those are the markets to focus on.You do seem to look at the macro environment much more than other value investors. Why do you think this is important?When people entrust you with their life savings, you want to make sure you can compound their returns through thick and thin. That just comes from the humility of studying markets. There are different kinds of decline, like balance sheet decline or inflation-driven PE compression. You want to identify what kind of market environment we're in, and what that looks like over the last 200 years. It's funny when you look at periods where we've had deflation. I think from the late 1860s to 1900, we had tremendous deflation and yet our economy grew 4 to 5% a year. Human nature tends to repeat, but with the way things are changing with technology, we've never had this kind of exponential growth.The macro environment is important because you're looking at supply and demand. There are stocks that look low, like the banks did back in 2008. But if you looked at the big picture, they were borrowing heavily. Washington Mutual was borrowing to pay their dividends. Look at what's happened now to commodities; we were calling for that. We've talked about this 118-month boom up through 2011 in commodities, which was preceded by a 113-month boom in housing and a 114-month boom in telecom media. It really helps to pay attention to big supply and demand, so when prices are high, inputs come in. Copper was sitting at three times the cost of production, and we said most commodities can only trade about half the cost of production. Sure enough, you're seeing that now, and it's kind of the opposite of 2011.Our mandate is to compound clients' money and to do that, you follow two of Buffett's rules: First rule is don't lose your capital, second rule is don't forget the first rule. Those two rules have been the savior for my career since 1982. But doing that requires a very dedicated research effort to not only look at each entity in its entirety, but also to look at supply and demand. That still doesn't mean we're focusing on predicting markets or predicting interest rates. We're looking at areas where we can get hurt, and that means going back to examine history. Albert Einstein once said that compounding was man's greatest invention. We don't want to violate that, and that means through this research effort, we can mitigate risk by looking at all the variables and inputs.That makes sense. Another reader asks how do you stay on top of your 130-plus stock positions?This stems from Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio); he will buy 100 shares of a lot of businesses. It has more to do with tracking. You want to track a lot of businesses, because if you see a good business, you may want to watch it. We tend to track businesses for many years, and in a lot of cases we'll track companies for years before we buy them. We want to track them and audit them because there's a business behind that stock quote. It can take sometimes years to get up to speed on a business, especially if it's international.For example, we've been with Carlos Slim since the 1980s, so we buy his businesses and watch him. But the price may not be right or the knowledge level may not be high enough. We know ahead of time what we want and we're just waiting for the market to adjust the price.A lot of people say "I just concentrate." And we did that in the 1980s, we concentrated heavily. If you concentrate in a high market, there's about an 85-90% correlation on the downside, or at least there has been in the last big market decline. If you're concentrated, clients just cannot deal with the pain of 50% drops. They should be able to, but it's rare that they can. For us to compound, we have to make sure we can protect, and that means our position tends to go down in higher markets and they get more concentrated in lower markets. Peter Lynch used to have about 1,000-3,000 companies, so 130 is not much to follow.The next question is from a reader who has eight mutual funds and about 30 stocks he follows. He asks if you recommend setting a stop loss order for all the stocks. Is there a rule of thumb for long-term investors?The problem is when you put in a stop loss and the market closes, and if it reopens 20% less, you're going to fall 20% lower. I've learned that any time that takes you away from the underlying reality of the business is time wasted, in my opinion. The option was designed to give you some more income, but you really want to know the operating realities. You just need to know what you own, and then if it goes down, you can buy more. The problem is most people don't have a clue what they own. If something is fully valued and the fundamentals have deteriorated, it's better to focus on the underlying fundamentals of the investments because you can see those problems far in advance if you're doing the homework. Stop losses or any kind of option is a short cut that takes you away from the basic job of knowing your investments.We typically see a 10% correction every two years; that's just normal. A far better approach is to find superior businesses and be ready to buy more when the markets decline. The top 25 businesses over 25 years typically have lost between 18,000-63,000%. You don't want to miss out on that by either doing options or stop losses, because those big crashes are where you make the big returns.This next question is from a reader who asks "My husband and I are 55 and 54 and currently employed with decent incomes. We lost everything we had accumulated over 30 years including our homes and two businesses. We used all of our IRA savings to try to keep our businesses afloat, but ended up having to file bankruptcy. We're starting over with no savings and we're buying a house this month. Is there an aggressive way to save money and rebuild a portfolio for retirement?"The whole idea of retirement has to be rethought; now is the time to reflect and say "Are we doing what we really want to do?" In watching the whole retirement cycle, it can be a blessing to say, let's just do what we really like doing, what's our passion? You don't need much money if you're really engaged in something you like doing.Bob Pamplin was a tremendous mentor and one of the early CEOs of Georgia Pacific. There was a mandatory retirement age of 65 at Georgia Pacific, so I asked him "Are you going to just play golf?" And he said "No, that's the year to get started on my career." That's when he started buying stock and became the biggest in the world in retirement.In capitalism, you need the capital to compete. You need an aggressive savings problem, but also a passion for what you're doing. If you're passionate about what you're engaged in, you don't have time to spend any money. I think our nation has to rethink the idea of retirement as you make a bunch of money and retire at 65 - that's going to change. You're going to have to be retrained throughout your life to find a new passion and follow it.John D. Rockefeller's big thing was going off his ledger. Keep track of everything you spend and save, and that's a way to make sure you achieve your savings goal.One reader asks if you're familiar with stocks trading below the company's liquidation value, and do you invest in them?Yes, but we'll typically invest via the debt markets. In other words, if we're not buying a real high grade quality business, we'll tend to buy the debt. If it's a liquidation scenario, we would rather go in as the first lien holder on that kind of situation. Again, those take a lot of time, and they're not something we usually do. We're looking for something we can make 10-50 times our money over 10 or 20 years. Those liquidations tend to be in high tax places like California, so that approach isn't what we would usually do. We will buy distressed, but typically we'll be buying the debt.The next question is from a reader who wants to become a professional stock picker. With the benefit of hindsight, what would be your advice for him to work his way up in this field?When I called up Buffett back in 1982, his advice was to get far away from Wall Street, go from A to Z, and out-research everyone. He recommended reading Ben Graham's the Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, and so on. But the big thing is having a passion - the passion to endure and the passion of enormous research. That's what you have to have; you can't do it for the money. You've got to do it because you love learning, studying great operators and just studying business in general.The field is extremely crowded, and there are more funds than stocks. But there's tremendous opportunity for the independent thinking business analyst who has cumulative knowledge. Right now, everyone's kind of trained to be passive. If you're in a passive fund for 10 years, you won't learn anything. I was always taught they can take all your money away, but they can't take your knowledge. You're trying to build a database of knowledge so you can critically examine anything presented to you. It's also important to know accounting because that's the language of business.Your exposure to the industrial sector was about 10% a few years ago and has declined recently. What are your thoughts on this sector?We've been a bit shy because of the Chinese boom, which is creating a boom in commodities. When that boom busts, it will take a lot of business. We try to get the portfolio more into businesses that are independent of these boom-bust cycles. We would love to have Fastenal (FAST), but at 25x earnings, we don't even want to bother.So Fastenal is on your watch list for now?Yeah, in the past we were watching them. We were trying to get a double or triple play, but that comes with low valuation and that doesn't work in bubble environments very well. But Fastenal's business is great, they make nuts and bolts, and the business is boring. Their returns are really exceptional.Could you tell us about an investment mistake you've made and what you learned from the experience?Where do you start? It's not so much you're making mistakes; it's just things change when you go in the fundamentals. Most of the time, it's because the fundamentals change to the down side. But fortunately, we haven't had anything that has hurt clients permanently over the years, because we mitigate those with smaller positions. If we were concentrated and made a wrong move, it can be devastating to the compounding process. One mistake was in 2008 when we didn't sell all of our bank shares. We scaled back on banks in 2007, but we didn't take them totally out. Mistakes come from not reacting to deteriorated fundamentals, not doing enough research and not digging deep enough.Tesco (TSCO.L) was a mistake - we thought they would refocus quicker and they didn't. They wanted a huge global expansion, and we expected they would refocus back on U.K. grocers. But they are definitely a company that can be fixed. Generally, turnarounds take a lot longer than you think, so believing they will turn around quickly is often a bad idea. The problem is you can follow the price and buy when prices are down, but that doesn't mean they can't continue to go lower if the fundamentals haven't turned. Again, that goes back to the importance of being thorough in the research.In the current market, are there any specific industries or sectors where you're seeing more bargains than others?We like to buy companies that have a very specific problem. For example, Precision Castparts has great management, tremendous leadership, and it's down because of the energy portion of their business, which is getting all of the attention. You're looking to buy companies that have fixable problems, or the Duponts of the world, where there's a lot of pressure on those companies. If they split up, there are tremendous opportunities. We see opportunities in companies that have several divisions and are spinning them off. Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was spun out of Baxter (BAX) so they could focus on just heart valves. You want to get those businesses as they come out on the spin offs.As market levels get higher, we're looking at the more managerial-driven companies where you have a catalyst, similar to eBay (EBAY) and PayPal (PYPL) splitting up. We see those companies as the biggest opportunities. We'll also buy oil, but as far as the supply and demand of the market, as the market levels go higher, we want to be less exposed to that down side. And when the markets crash, higher quality names will tend to bounce back quicker. The good thing about energy is historically when you've had this kind of drop, you saw a real pick-up in the general economy, because the economy is mostly consumption-oriented. The pain you see in the commodities and energy space will translate into gains in the overall economy. I think it's good for businesses when you have an energy collapse like 1998, when Russia defaulted and emerging markets had a hard time. The dollar strengthened, but the money flowed into the high quality businesses. And I think that's what we're starting to see in the narrowing of markets right now.What books would you recommend to a beginning value investor?"The Outsiders" by William Thorndike is a good one about CEOs who are great capital allocators. And, of course, all of Buffett's recommended books like "The Intelligent Investor" and "Security Analysis". Roger Lorenstein's book about Buffett "The Making of an American Capitalist" is great, too. It's also useful to study the greats like John D. Rockefeller for anyone starting out in business, which teaches the importance of ledgers, accounting, and using ledgers to keep your emotions out of the decision-making process.This interview was edited for length and clarity.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
