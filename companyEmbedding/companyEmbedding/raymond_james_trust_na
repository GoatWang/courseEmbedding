Building an estate is one thing. Protecting it so it can meet your needs and then be passed on to your heirs is quite another.

Creating a legacy of giving
Is a private foundation or a donor-advised fund the best alternative?
When people think of leaving a legacy, many first consider the path of creating a private foundation. Private foundations bring with them a certain level of prestige and provide you with total and private control. But there are costs associated with that autonomy, including administrative burdens that could be reallocated into other charitable means.
For many, a donor-advised fund is an attractive alternative. With this option, you retain a strong influence on how your charitable gifts are used, but free yourself from significant costs. A private foundation requires more money, time, legal assistance and administration to establish and maintain compared to a donor-advised fund, which is a relatively flexible strategy.
What is a donor-advised fund?
A donor-advised fund, or DAF, is a type of charitable fund that is administered by a public charity and can be established with as little as $10,000. One such organization is the Raymond James Charitable Endowment Fund (RJCEF), which receives donations from individuals and other entities and then donates these funds to the appropriate charitable recipients per the donor’s wishes.
Both a private foundation and a DAF allow you to choose what charities you want to assist at a later date. In addition, they both can be named to honor you personally. And like a private foundation, a DAF is immediately deductible for federal income tax (subject to applicable restrictions), estate and gift purposes upon acceptance from the RJCEF.  
As with a private foundation, a DAF gives you the flexibility to assign the fund allocation to your children.
Family or friends appointed to a donor-advised fund may:

Recommend how donations are to be invested within the fund
Identify the charities that will ultimately receive grants from the fund
Specify how much will be given
Determine who will make the above decisions instead of, or as a successor to, themselves

The DAF also provides key tax advantages such as:

While both strategies offer immediate tax deductions, donor-advised deductions are more generous.
You can deduct cash contributions to a fund totaling up to 50% of your adjusted gross income each year; the limit for donations to a private foundation is 30%.
You can also deduct up to 30% of your adjusted gross income for donations to a fund of long-term securities that have appreciated in value since you bought them; for a private foundation, the limit for such donations is 20%.
With a private foundation you are required to pay a 2% excise tax on investment income annually; with a donor-advised fund, however, there is no tax on investment income.

Choosing the path that fits.
Is a DAF right for you? Or should you pursue the private foundation path instead? If you would like to explore either option for your charitable giving strategy, be sure to work closely with your financial advisor. Not only can they help you reach your charitable giving goals, they can also help you develop a strategy – working alongside your CPA or tax professional – that best integrates into your overall financial plan.
No matter which route you choose, supporting deserving organizations can create positive changes in people’s lives and communities for years to come. But remember, for any successful financial plan, it’s important to establish your personal goals for both the short and long term early in the process.
A few steps taken today can go a long way toward helping your charity tomorrow.
Please note, changes in tax laws or regulations may occur at any time and could substantially impact your situation. You should discuss any tax or legal matters with the appropriate professional.

Questions About Trusts
Answers to the most frequently asked questions about trusts 
 Few people understand the terminology and technicalities of trusts until they discover they need one ... and by then it may be too late. Use this list of frequently asked questions (and their answers) to help you better understand the reasons for trusts and the process involved in establishing them.
What is a trust?
A trust is a legal agreement between two parties, the person who creates the trust and the person, institution or independent trust company responsible for administering the trust, the trustee. The trustee manages the assets placed in the trust for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary.
Who needs a trust?
Not everyone needs a trust, but most people should consider one. Trusts aren’t just for the affluent. Setting up a trust is an excellent way to control what happens to your estate, regardless of its size, to possibly reduce estate taxes and protect against the expense and aggravation of probate.
More than two million U.S. taxpayers have established trusts. Those who benefit most are married couples with net estates exceeding $4 million and single people with net estates exceeding $2 million; however, under the current tax law, these amounts will increase over the next several years.
The net value of an estate can be determined by adding the market value of all assets, including real estate, personal property, businesses, bank accounts, investments, IRAs or other retirement benefits, and life insurance, then subtracting liabilities.
Unlike wills, trusts are not subject to probate and therefore allow you to keep your affairs private.
Will or trust? Which is best?
Most people need both. A big advantage of a trust is that it is generally the best strategy to avoid probate and protect financial privacy. Wills must be validated by probate court, a lengthy and expensive process that can take six months to two years and, in some cases, even longer. Probating a will may involve attorney’s fees, executor’s commissions, administrative and other court costs. Unlike wills, trusts are not subject to probate and therefore enable you to keep your affairs private and minimize settlement costs and estate taxes.
Why set up a trust?
There are many reasons to set up trusts. Married couples often realign the ownership of their assets to save substantial federal estate taxes and pass more on to their heirs. Rather than owning assets jointly, they choose to own assets individually so that they can each take full advantage of the increasing unified credit amount. Preserving each spouse’s unified credit can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes.
If the time comes that you are no longer able to handle your own affairs, trusts can ensure that there will be someone who is experienced and objective to “mind the store.” If there is a serious illness or disability, a trust ensures that a plan is in place to take care of your needs and those of your loved ones.
When the trust is managed by a full-service trust company, other professional services can be provided, such as bill paying.
Business owners can use trusts to save on estate taxes when passing along businesses to heirs.
Trusts are also useful for blended families with spouses or children from previous marriages. The trust can spell out exactly how marriage affects the inheritance of children or grandchildren from a first marriage.
Naming an independent trust company removes the emotional element often associated with friends or family members.
Who sets up a trust?
Usually attorneys draft trusts.
What about fees?
Generally, fees for trust services are spelled out in the trust document. Under normal circumstances, they are calculated annually, based on the level of responsibility assumed by the trustee and the value of the assets in the trust. Fees are charged quarterly or monthly and a portion may be tax-deductible.
How are trust assets invested?
Ultimately, it is the purpose of the trust that determines how the assets are invested, and it is the responsibility of the trustee to see that the purpose is carried out. Often, the person who creates the trust will name a professional investment manager to work with the trustee and make investment recommendations based on the goals of the trust, the needs of the beneficiaries and the time horizon.
Is a trust right for you?
Even people of moderate means may be subject to estate taxes, which could be significantly higher than income taxes.
But saving on taxes isn’t the only reason for trusts. Some families want to plan for long-term care or education for their children or grandchildren. Others want to provide for a favorite charity. One thing is certain, if a trust is needed, the time to plan for it is now.
How do you choose a trustee?
Many people prefer to name an independent trust company to handle their affairs. Trustees who don’t deal with trusts on a regular basis can be overwhelmed by the duties required of them. Also, naming an independent trust company removes the emotional element often associated with friends or family members and assures that your wishes are fulfilled exactly as they are spelled out in the trust.
Why choose Raymond James Trust, N.A.?
There are several advantages to naming Raymond James Trust as trustee. Unlike other providers of trust services, our skilled professionals deal exclusively with trust issues. The solutions our trust experts provide are never “one size fits all,” but are individually tailored to fit personal needs.
In addition, Raymond James Trust offers:

Professional management by trained experts

State-of-the-art technology to serve clients better and faster

Special needs trusts
Help ensure the well-being of a loved one with special needs.
A special needs trust, which can be set up by a parent, legal guardian or a court, is designed to provide financial security and long-term care for a beneficiary with mental or physical challenges. Once you set up a special needs trust, it is irrevocable and generally cannot be changed. It protects the assets set aside for the care of your loved one and ensures those assets are managed according to your wishes, even after your death. Furthermore, your beneficiary will retain access to essential governmental benefits, like Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid, and there may be some tax advantages.
At Raymond James Trust, we have the knowledge and expertise to help you with all facets of a special needs trust. From investing and managing the assets to helping you address the specific challenges of your unique case, our experienced professionals are here to support you every step of the way.

Solutions & Services
Custom solutions to strengthen your legacy
To meet the unique needs of our clients, Raymond James Trust, N.A. can serve in a number of roles, including trustee, co-trustee, custodian, personal representative, or agent to a trustee on several types of personal trusts. As trustee, Raymond James Trust offers the professional management of skilled experts, impartiality in making investment decisions and dealing with beneficiaries, and state-of-the-art technology that serves clients better and faster.
Trust Solutions
Our team offers a vast array of trust solutions, including:
Irrevocable Trusts
This type of living trust cannot be changed or canceled, but the assets are not considered part of your estate, so they are not accessible by creditors. Irrevocable trusts are typically set up to provide tax savings, asset protection or some other benefit.
Revocable Trusts
The terms of a revocable trust can be canceled or changed, and the trust can be terminated at any time. Revocable trusts do not take assets out of your estate, so they are still accessible to creditors. Living trusts such as this avoid probate and do not become a matter of public record.
Charitable Trusts
There are two main types of charitable trusts that can help you support your favorite cause: A charitable remainder trust (CRT) is an irrevocable trust in which you receive income for life. Upon death, the remaining assets are donated to your charity of choice. A charitable lead trust (CLT) is an irrevocable trust that pays an annuity to a charity for a set number of years, then pays the remaining assets to a named beneficiary upon your death. A donor advised fund (DAF) is an additional alternative charitable giving solution but is not considered a trust. For more information, click here.
Life Insurance Trusts
These trusts give ownership of the life insurance policy to the trust, taking it out of your estate. This can help reduce estate taxes and make proceeds available immediately after your passing. The proceeds from life insurance trusts are used to pay taxes, legal fees, probate costs and other liabilities when the person who created the trust dies. After the debts are paid, the trustee distributes the remaining proceeds to the beneficiary.
Special Needs Trusts
Designed to provide financial security and long-term care to a beneficiary with special needs or a disability, a special needs trust preserves the eligibility for needs-based government benefits, so Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid will still be available to the beneficiary.
Delaware Directed Trusts
Delaware is known as a trust-friendly jurisdiction with innovative laws regarding taxes and asset protection. Through our private label partnership with New York Private Trust Company, Raymond James Trust is able to offer this type of trust to nonresidents. For high-net-worth individuals, establishing a Delaware directed trust offers several attractive benefits such as confidentiality, asset protection, substantial tax advantages, simple transfers and modernizations, and liberal investment policies.
Other Specialty Trusts
Raymond James Trust can work with you to come up with the best solution for your unique needs, from generation-skipping trusts and marital-bypass trusts to dynasty trusts and beyond.













Settlement Services


We’re here to help when the dust needs settling


You and your beneficiaries can count on Raymond James Trust to be present every step of the way as arrangements are made and carried out during a complicated, stressful and difficult time. From providing accurate explanations of all estate and court proceedings to preparing final tax returns, we’re here to guide you.




Trust Settlement
Estate Settlement



Trust Settlement

Trust Settlement
If your estate is set up through a trust, Raymond James Trust can help coordinate the settlement after death. We keep detailed records to effectively manage the estate and work with attorneys and accountants to ensure that assets are distributed according to your wishes. This type of settlement is appropriate for those who have set up their estate through trusts, those who cannot or do not want to manage their financial affairs, or those who wish to have assets remain in trust for their family after passing.





Estate Settlement

Estate Settlement
If your estate is set up through a will, Raymond James Trust can help move the settlement through the probate process, coordinating with attorneys and accountants while identifying, collecting, valuing and managing your assets, final taxes and so forth. As personal representative or executor, we will keep detailed records to effectively manage the estate, relieve family members of an overwhelming responsibility and provide superior personal attention to beneficiaries. This type of settlement is appropriate for those who have their estate set up through a will, those who would like the confidence that comes from knowing that their estate is secure and protected from unnecessary settlement costs and taxes, and those who want their heirs to be provided for properly and their estate settled according to their wishes.

Make charitable giving part of your financial plan
Earn an income stream while honoring your favorite charity
Supporting charities can be a fulfilling and important part of your life. It’s a way to make a difference and carry on your legacy. But when you incorporate philanthropic goals into your overall financial plan, your financial advisor can help you:

Ensure that you have the right funds available for donation to the charity of your choice
Set up giving plans that provide lifetime income and other benefits for you and your loved ones
Maximize income and estate tax benefits
Maintain a source of income

As the last point indicates, an important consideration for many charitable giving plans is determining the best way to maintain an income stream. With pooled income funds and charitable gift annuities, two options available through your Raymond James advisor, you can donate to your favorite charity while maximizing tax benefits and maintaining a stream of income.
Pooled income fund

A pooled income fund, also referred to as a life income fund, is managed by a public charity. When you establish a pooled income fund, you set aside money for a charity of your choice, avoid capital gains taxes on appreciated assets, and take an immediate partial tax deduction at the time you make your contribution.
Your assets are comingled and managed together with assets donated by other individuals. In return, you receive a pro-rata share of the income for life. The income stream paid to you and/or your named beneficiary is generally paid monthly.
Upon the death of the last income beneficiary, the principal/property passes through to the charity you designated.

Charitable gift annuity

A charitable gift annuity is a simple, contractual agreement between you and the charity, whereby you transfer cash or property to the charity in exchange for a partial tax deduction and a lifetime stream of annual income from the charity. There is no trust involved.
The income tax deduction received equals the difference between the fair market value of the donated property and the present value of the income payments. The amount of the income stream is determined by many factors, including age and the policy of the charity. (Most charities use payout rates defined by the American Council on Gift Annuities.)
Like a pooled income fund, upon death, charity benefits from the remainder.

When considering these or any options for your charitable giving strategy, be sure to work closely with your financial advisor. Not only can they help you reach your charitable giving goals, they can also help you develop a strategy that best integrates into your overall financial plan.
Remember, for any successful financial plan, it’s important to establish your personal goals for both the short and long term early in the process. So consider speaking to your financial advisor. They’ll work with your CPA or tax professionals to help you develop the optimal charitable giving strategy – and help you find the right way to do the right thing.
Please note, changes in tax laws or regulations may occur at any time and could substantially impact your situation. You should discuss any tax or legal matters with the appropriate professional.

Consider charitable giving in 2012
Donate this year and reduce your overall tax burden
A charitable donation can provide a feeling of personal satisfaction. It may also result in a more tangible return for you in the form of desirable tax benefits. And given the pending tax changes that are expected to impact charitable contributions in 2013, now may be the time to give to your favorite charity before the end of 2012.
Most of the time, donations of cash, real estate or other assets to qualified charities count as an itemized deduction for that tax year. The deductibility of charitable gifts is based on several factors, including the donor’s income, the nature of the donation and the charity receiving the donation.
Here’s what to expect in terms of charitable giving changes from 2012 to 2013:

There are proposed changes to limit the total value of itemized deductions to no more than 28% of adjusted gross income for taxpayers in the proposed 36% and 39.6% brackets. Under this scenario, a charitable donation would provide significantly reduced tax savings in 2013 versus 2012. In simple terms, if you were to make a $10,000 donation to a charity of choice, you could only claim a $2,800 deduction on your taxes if you waited until 2013 to make the donation versus a $3,960 deduction (for the highest tax bracket) if the donation is made by December 31, 2012.
The level of allowed itemized deductions, including charitable donations, for higher-income taxpayers (sometimes called the 3% haircut) is also slated to return in 2013. Basically, taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes over the applicable threshold (a proposed $261,450 for couples in 2013) would lose deductions equal to 3% of the excess up to a maximum of 80%. There is also a proposal to limit all itemized deductions to a fixed dollar maximum.

Charitable giving in 2012 is a viable strategy to possibly minimize your overall tax burden. In addition to donating assets tax-free, a 2012 charitable donation strategy could also help put your taxable estate into a lower tax bracket by removing assets from the estate. There are no limits on the amount that you can pass to a charity, but there may be an optimum donation amount to consider, depending on your overall tax situation, the charity of choice and your family values.
It’s important to consider other ways to position charitable giving for maximum tax advantages, such as using charitable contributions to offset a conversion of a traditional IRA (or other qualified retirement assets) to a Roth IRA in 2012.
When determining the right kind of charitable giving strategy, your Raymond James financial advisor can help you. Your advisor will also work with your CPA or tax professional to coordinate the most appropriate tax strategies for your situation. Remember, what is most critical is establishing your personal goals for both the short and long term. Tax strategies can be used to help you achieve these goals and should be utilized within the context of your overall financial picture.
