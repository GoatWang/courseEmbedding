You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

                                A PeopleClaim letter-rating represents our opinion of a company’s reliability based
                                on, among other factors, their response to complaints filed by PeopleClaim users.
                                Higher ratings generally reflect a history of constructively responding to all complaints
                                filed through our system, or no history of claims filed against the company through
                                PeopleClaim. See Terms of Use

                                WeCare is PeopleClaim's business-friendly interactive profile that lets you connect
                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time. I've been really satisfied for the most part. They report quickly and accurately, remind me when my bill is due, and the customer service has been kind and thorough....show more

Academy Bank


                                            They cancelled my secured credit card without informing me.  Did not refund the money from secured card without me calling,. Guess they thought I might forget.  Will be closing all accounts with them today.  Worst customer service of any bank I've dealt with

Alfa Insurance


                                            I have (had) been with Alfa for 23 years. Over the course of the last few years, my premiums kept going up. $20 here, $30 there - well, this last time it went up over $200 with the new renewal. I have a perfect driving record- no tickets, no wrecks- and yet my insurance jumps up...show more

NetSpend® Visa® Prepaid Card


                                            I've had a NetSpend prepaid debit card for approximately 3 years. Up until recently I've had no problem.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! They do not work with you at all to satisfy the customer. Other credit unions help you ESPECIALLY if you have great credit. This CU doesn't tell you everything so verify everything with two other reps. Total Nightmare!

First PREMIER® Bank Mastercard Credit Card


                                            Do you have to link your personal bank account to pay the fees for the card. How do you pay your bill monthly. I see other people comment about they took money out of there bank account. How did they get their bank information from.
