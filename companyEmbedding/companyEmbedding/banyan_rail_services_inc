Banyan Rail Services Inc. Completes Reverse Stock Split






Business Wire




Apr 7, 2010 8:20 AM EDT













 


















































  Banyan Rail Services Inc. (OTCBB:BARA), a railroad support services company, announced that the previously approved 1-for-10 reverse stock split was completed effective today. The reverse stock split converts 10 shares of Banyan Rail’s common stock into 1 share of common stock. To indicate the split, the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board will append a “D” to the Company’s trading symbol and for a period of 20 business days the Company’s stock will trade under the symbol “BARAD.” After 20 days, the symbol will revert to “BARA.” The Company also said that it has completed the exchange of $1,525,000 of convertible debentures into 15,250 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, reducing the Company’s debt and increasing the Company’s stockholders’ equity.  Banyan Rail also announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Wood Energy Group, Inc. (“Wood Energy”), has completed the construction of a railroad tie grinding facility in Shreveport, Louisiana. Wood Energy, one of the nation’s largest railroad tie reclamation/energy generation companies, reclaims railroad ties for Class I, regional and short line railroads and then disposes of the ties to either the energy co-generation or landscape markets. In its newly-completed Shreveport facility, Wood Energy is grinding reclaimed rail ties and providing the product to International Paper (NYSE:IP), which uses the product as a source of biomass fuel for its containerboard mill in Mansfield, Louisiana. The new tie grinding facility increases Wood Energy’s operating margin as this business was previously outsourced.  In addition, Class I rail carrier Kansas City Southern Railway Company (“KCS”) (NYSE:KSU) recently signed an agreement with Wood Energy to deliver reclaimed railroad ties to Wood Energy’s tie grinding facility in Shreveport. This new business increases the supply of ties for Wood Energy’s grinding facility.  Banyan Rail Services Inc. is a railroad support services company headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The Company owns The Wood Energy Group, Inc., one of the nation’s largest railroad tie reclamation/energy generation companies.

BOCA RATON, Fla., April 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Banyan Rail Services Inc. (OTC: BARA) is currently seeking strategic acquisitions that will substantially increase shareholder value as part of our long term growth strategy. We are focused primarily on acquiring companies within the rail services and manufacturing sectors with significant revenues with consistently strong earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization. Our focus is to partner with existing management teams who are dedicated to further growing the companies both organically and through future mergers and acquisitions.








After completion of our due diligence review and in accordance with our long term growth strategy, we elected to terminate the previously announced asset purchase agreement and real estate purchase agreement, both dated February 16, 2016, between Banyan, Thermocast Acquisition Corporation and International Thermocast and its affiliated companies. See Banyan's Form 8-K filed on April 20, 2016 for additional information.
Safe Harbor Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThere can be no assurance that Banyan will be able to complete the acquisitions described in this press release. In addition, some of the statements that we make in this press release, including statements about our confidence in the Company's prospects and strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of §21E of the Securities Exchange Act. Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by words like "believe," "expect," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," or similar terms; others can be determined by context.

Banyan Rail Services Inc. Announces Agreement to Acquire International Thermocast Corporation and The Dekor Corporation

Feb 18, 2016, 12:00 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Banyan Rail Services Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Banyan Rail Services Inc. (OTC: BARA) executed an asset purchase agreement with International Thermocast Corporation and The Dekor Corporation, both Georgia Corporations (collectively, "Sellers"), and Mark Anderson, an individual resident of the State of Georgia and the sole shareholder of Sellers,  for the purchase of Sellers' business of manufacturing and distributing composite kitchen and bath sinks and accessories including cast acrylic and granite sinks, cultured and synthetic marble vanity tops and other related goods and services (the "Business"). The purchase price for the Business is $4,510,000, consisting of cash payments, common stock, and assumed liabilities, subject to a closing adjustment.
In addition, Banyan executed a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with Anderson Investment Management, Inc. ("Anderson Investment"), an affiliate of Sellers, for the purchase of Anderson Investment's real property, located at 189 Etowah Industrial Court, Canton, Georgia. The purchase price for the real property is $3,800,000.
The Purchase Agreement and the Real Estate Purchase Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnification provisions. The consummation of these transactions depends upon the satisfaction or waiver of a number of customary closing conditions and the receipt of consents and regulatory approvals.
"This acquisition is the first step in the long term growth and reorganization strategy of Banyan. Thermocast is an industry leader in the manufacture and distribution of composite and synthetic marble kitchen and bath sinks and provides a strong platform base for future acquisitions. In addition, we are excited to add Mark Anderson and his 20 years of experience in the industry to our team," said Jon Ryan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Banyan.
A portion of the purchase price will be paid in newly-issued Banyan stock and the company intends to obtain debt financing for the remainder.

In addition, some of the statements that we make in this press release, including statements about our confidence in the Company's prospects and strategies are forward-looking statements within the meaning of §21E of the Securities Exchange Act. Some of these forward-looking statements can be identified by words like "believe," "expect," "will," "should," "intend," "plan," or similar terms; others can be determined by context. Statements contained in this release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are necessarily estimates reflecting our best judgment based upon current information, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Many factors could affect the accuracy of these forward-looking statements, causing our actual results to differ significantly from those anticipated in these statements. You should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements, which reflect our analysis only as of the date of this release. The risks and uncertainties listed above and in documents that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and any current reports on Form 8-K, must be carefully considered by any investor or potential investor in the Company.

“We have multiple origin and destination cities that we use to ship many different commodities. Having them all in RSInet and automatically kept up to date has given us more time to focus on other strategic issues.”

Accessorial Charges



Reduce Demurrage and Customer Holding Costs
RSInet helps you to control demurrage charges by making it easy to monitor how long railcars have been at a location. The system can automatically calculate demurrage charges and provide invoice ready reports for customers that hold railcars past their allowable days.












“We use rail terminals throughout the country to collect and distribute our products. Demurrage charges can be a significant cost. With RSInet we have been able to see where we are at risk for demurrage and take steps to proactively control it.”

Schedule shop work, track maintenance costs, store maintenance records – keeping your fleet operating smoothly is easier when the information on your railcars is well organized.

USRail Insight™ Rail Rate & Traffic Analysis Software
Benchmark your freight rates, find savings opportunities, and negotiate with more confidence.


Introductory Video ›



USRail Insight is an online tool for reducing your rail freight rates.  View routing alternatives and quickly develop estimated rates (also useful for sales departments).  Answer the question “is the rate from the railroad reasonable?”  Insight allows you to see where the opportunities are and how to put together a business case for better rates. USRail.desktop was the PC based forerunner for USRail Insight.





RATE PROCUREMENT PROCESS



It’s Not Just About the Software.
When you license our software you also get unlimited product support from our team with over 100 years of rail pricing experience (on each side of the table). Whether you want to discuss long term rate strategy ideas, get ready for a presentation to management on your transportation costs versus the competition, or preparing for an important meeting with a rail carrier, take advantage of our insight and experience.












“The best rail costing tool keeps getting better and the benefit far outweighs the modest cost of the software.  We have and will continue to use it in our negotiations and to determine our competitiveness in markets in a rapidly changing environment.” – Thomas Waskiewicz, Ingredion

CARRIER COSTS & MARGINS



Understand the Marketplace Like Never Before
What purchasing manager would ever spend significant dollars without understanding a vendor’s costs? USRail Insight includes a proprietary cost model in addition to the government’s Uniform Rail Costing System (URCS). Our cost model is updated with quarterly railroad financial data and it is used by a number of railroads as well as the majority of large rail shippers in the U.S. Knowing the operating cost isn’t critical only for developing rate targets, it’s also a useful tool for estimating rail rates without needing to request and wait for a quote.






“DuPont has relied on USRail to quickly and easily assess our rail rates and in the process, identify those that do not meet our reasonableness’ standard. USRail has served us well as a valuable negotiating tool.” -Kevin G. Acker, DuPont






Software that works like you do: Everywhere


















“It’s a user friendly ‘no-brainer’ purchase for anyone shipping commodities by rail.” -Phillip R. Bedwell, OmniSource Corporation





RAIL RATE BENCHMARKING



Analyze Your Rates the Same Way Railroad Pricing Managers Do.
Do you know how your rail rates compare to what other shippers are paying? USRail Insight has a large database of sample freight bills from the Surface Transportation Board as well as profitability comparisons generated from railroad data. You should understand how carrier market shares are changing and consider if there are railroad pricing strategies that are influencing those trends.

INDUSTRY INFORMATION



Save Time and Reduce Errors
What is the fuel surcharge miles for this lane and what is the current rate? Where is the map for the SJVR and who is the rate contact and what is his phone number? What is the abbreviation the railroad for Guanajuato Mexico? This industry requires a lot reference information and having much of it organized and kept up-to-date in one place saves countless hours.












“We use USRail all day, every day.  So much information all in one place; it’s a real time saver.” -Bert Skarbek, Lumbermen’s Merchandising Corporation
