Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.
To learn more visit our blog.



Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Laundry Made Better with ENERGY STARSummertime is in full swing, and for many families, that means spending lots of time outdoors, enjoying the best that the season has to offer. From days spent at the pool, to camping, hiking, and hitting the beach, summertime also means plenty of extra laundry piling up. 












 


Saving Money and Energy Can Be a Breeze – With Your Ceiling FanJust think about sitting in the grass on that hot summer day, and a breeze comes up and just feels fantastic – like it’s suddenly five degrees cooler.  It feels good because the movement of air past your skin means you can transfer heat from your body faster – it really does cool you down.&n

A Reliable Supply of Exceptional Products
AllEnergy Sand will produce a line of high quality 20/40, 30/50 and 40/70 wet and dry hydraulic fracturing sand (frac sand). Our products will be thoroughly tested and offer complete documentation including Material Safety Data Sheets.
Our frac sand is produced from natural sources in Wisconsin with excellent natural composition, durability and spherical qualities. Our production methods help ensure exceptional supply reliability and consistent quality.
AllEnergy Sand goes above and beyond with their logistics to go with our outstanding products. Because we use a conveyor and rail system to move our products, we are able to eliminate the emissions and expense of trucking to better help our environment and our investors. We can carry the raw materials from the mine to processing and easily get our sand products to our customers in Canada, Texas, Ohio, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Dakota and beyond. We make it our goal to be efficient, but also eco-friendly with our product transport. We aren’t affected by seasons restrictions on the road, so we can make our product available at any time.
Our products are from the very best natural frac sand deposits available throughout the world. Better yet, they are right here at home in west central Wisconsin. With products produced here from mining projects in the USA, we are supporting American energy independence.
Contact us for more information on our product line or to learn more about investing in frac sand companies, or more about our company in general.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
