Patriot One Technologies May Revolutionize Site Security - Patriot One Technologies Inc. (OTCMKTS:PTOTF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Patriot One Technologies May Revolutionize Site SecurityJul. 6.17 | About: Patriot One (PTOTF) M Plaut Long only, special situations, dividend investing, valueSummaryPossibly a disruptive new technology in site security.Patriot One has won a major award for its technology.The company already has orders for 90% of its 2017 production.In its first year of public operation, Patriot One Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB:PTOTF) (TSX.V:PAT) (FRA:0PL) has won a major award for its new weapons scanning system, as well as signed agreements with important distributors and moved closer to being able to provide a steady supply of a commercial product. 

 Although it has only been trading since last November, Patriot One has made impressive progress. It won, on Wednesday April 5th, the first place in the Anti-Terrorism/Force Protection Category in the New Product Showcase (NPS) component of the ISC West industry trade show and conference in Las Vegas, NV, the premier platform for security professionals to evaluate new products and technologies for use in security applications. The security screening equipment that is now in use at airports uses millimeter wave technology that is big, slow and expensive. People and packages must pass through special frames in which they are scanned for concealed weapons. This method also raises serious privacy questions. The Patriot One system uses microwave technology that is small, fast and cheap. It can screen objects in real time as they move along, and is not disruptive of normal, innocent traffic. The new system focuses on suspicious items, raising no privacy issues. The Patriot One system is an integrated hardware and software solution that immediately identifies objects of interest being carried in a single scan. It then makes a determination if they are a threat by comparing the new discovery to its constantly updated database of known threats. In this way, it can distinguish a smartphone from a knife or a gun. There are no privacy issues since it only zeroes in on the object it finds. To highlight the various components of the system, the company calls its breakthrough: cognitive microwave radar (CMR) technology.
 

 The basic package to be deployed is a small box that can be easily concealed to a screen passing people without intruding on their progress. If it identifies a threat, the information is transmitted through pre-established channels to security personnel and/or automatic machinery for an appropriate response. 

 The technology has the potential for very widespread use. I recall that somewhere it wrote that the company would charge $10,000 for an installation plus a modest monthly fee to cover the ongoing and updated database. The company has not released any sort of estimates or projections for sales, but it has enormous potential. Among potential locations that are candidates for the use of this technology, the company has identified 98,000 public schools in the USA alone (each school +10 entrances), 50,000 Federal buildings in US alone, 294 US embassies/consulates globally, 260 Canadian government offices in 150 countries, cinemas - in the US alone the top 4 chains represent 39,356 indoor screens in 5,463 sites and 656 drive-in screens in 393 sites - and also over 200 stadiums (with cap. over 30,000) just in North America alone each with multiple entrances. It is also cheap and flexible enough to be used on public transportation, including 600,000 public school buses in the US alone (each bus has two doors), 270 subway stations in London alone, 4,660 US passenger transit stations nationwide, and 1,751 airports in 174 countries and territories.
 The company is following a low-capital business model, maintaining patents and an engineering staff, but outsourcing the manufacture of the products itself. In a message at the beginning of May summarizing Q1 and talking about plans for the future, President Dinesh Kandanchatha said that the central aim of the company is to deliver products in Q4 2017. A month later, the company said that it had $2.7M in signed agreements from around the world. The president also noted that in field trials "the system successfully and consistently detected concealed weapons with zero false negatives and a false positive rate of less than 5 per cent." What this means is that it detected all weapons (no false negatives) but it flagged a few non-weapons as threats (less than five percent false positives). This performance can be expected to improve with more experience, but in any case it is an err-on-the-side-of-caution type of performance. Presumably these would be checked out by the security staff and should not be a problem. 

 What is still lacking is FCC and Industry Canada certification. At that time, the president wrote that the company hoped to submit for certification before the end of Q2. If everything is on target, the certification submission is already in, but if not, submission is probably imminent. The president wrote that the company's internal testing indicated that its "production system can meet or exceed all the requirements for both FCC and Industry Canada certification while meeting our commitment to maintain the highest possible standard of efficacy." The company hopes to have certification by the end of the summer. It has already had requests from some customers for them to apply for special waivers that are possible under certification exemption guidelines.
 

 

 The company's chief science advisor is Dr. Natalia K. Nikolova, who is a professor of electrical engineering at McMaster University and a Canada research chair in high-frequency electromagnetics. She began the research in 2009 under the sponsorship of Defense Research and Development Canada (DRDC). DRDC sponsored a project that involved professors from four Canadian universities - Royal Military College, Queen's University, McMaster University and the University of Toronto - and one US university - Pennsylvania State University - to carry out preliminary feasibility studies. In an interview in the company's newsletter, she said that investors contacted McMaster University in December 2015 and proceeded toward commercialization activities immediately after a partnership was formed. Patriot One was established as a startup company for the sole purpose of bringing this solution to market. The company has signed agreements with resellers in Canada, the US, the UK and South Africa. It recently signed an agreement with a relatively large reseller in New Zealand, Aotea Security. Did Anyone Say Dilution? So far the price of the stock has hovered around US$0.60 (plus or minus). No one has missed anything by not buying up until now. On the other hand, the company's low-capital business model, plus the forecast first sales already in Q4, suggests that there will not be massive dilution before sales start rolling in.
 Furthermore, the company did raise funds in the middle of June, and the amount was relatively modest, for a total of $4 million (Canadian). It has not yet had any meaningful business operations, so its financial statements so far are of no interest. The company still seems to be largely under the radar of investors, and there is a possibility of an explosive rise in the stock price once word gets out. There is no way to know when this will be. The potential is certainly very great, but the company is still in startup mode and you should not invest any money that you cannot afford to lose.

PATSCAN™ Product Demonstration Video

Current technology requires compliance on the part of the target subject. With a fixed installation at a secure facility, perimeter controls require costly operator manpower and can be avoided during a dedicated assault. Individual screening with equipment that requires line-of-site and millimeter bandwidth scans are slow and prone to operator errors or false-positive results along with increasing privacy concerns. Expensive and slow, increased deployment of large fixed detection equipment will inevitably shift threats to “softer” less secure targets.
Practical detectors must be reasonably priced, small, covertly located, simple to operate, safe to health, have an intelligent yes/no decision making capability, and possess a low false alarm rate in the presence of strong relative interference and a background of innocuous normally carried metal.

Patriot One Technologies in partnership with researchers from Canada’s McMaster University have developed a solution that employs near field radar in a manner that addresses all the factors outlined above in a cost-effective system that is being developed for commercial application in public locations within a realistically short time-frame.
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY FAILS FOR MANY REASONS



 








      Smart Detection Gets Small and Practical    


      Radar Technology on a Chip    

Advances in radar technology leads to weapons detection adaptation

Semiconductor technology now routinely allows microwave circuits to be packaged into Integrated Circuits (IC).
Microwave radars have been in military service for years, but not widely deployed in commercial or consumer applications because of expense. Until now.
A variety of applications have arisen, such as liquid-level measurement, motion detection, door openers, intrusion alarms and police speed meters.



 









      Effectiveness    

The most widespread use of both microwave and millimeter-wave radar is automotive safety devices, including adaptive cruise control, automatic braking, collision warning, blind spot detection, lane departure warning, and backup object detection. While not the same as PATSCAN™ CMR hardware technology, the applicability as a result of miniaturization is similar.

A key advantage of microwave radar is its fine resolution in detecting small objects.
A multi-receiver version permits even finer precision in detecting objects and at wider angles.
In some instances both receiver and transceiver are on a single chip.
The Patriot One technology currently offers a high-grade effective operating range of approximately 2 meters (6.5 feet).

                  How is RUMOR different from other social media networks?
                  



WHAT WE DORUMOR is a hyperlocal social media platform with curated video content for you, by you (invite only). Take a glimpse into your block, see what's happening in realtime whether it's the next "IT" restaurant, bar, blog, concert, activity, or event. Peek inside new cities before visiting. Explore, create and share local content. Go incognito in public or share Rumors privately with friends, track how far your story spreads while pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a #solomo platform!!

We aggregate Yelp, OpenTable, Zomato, and FourSquare to get you a true Rumor Score. We aggregate Lyft and Uber to get you safely to and from your destination in-app. Driving on date night? We aggregate SpotHero, ParkingPanda and ParkWhiz too.(book the closest or best priced spot near that concert, event, or restaurant) Rumor takes care of the hard work for you. Practically magic.




                  What problem not addressed by other social networks is RUMOR trying to solve?
                  



OUR AMBITIONImagine if together we (our community) actually owned Social Media, the content we share, and all revenue generated from it. Twitter captured trending ideas worldwide. Facebook kept your circle of friends together. Instagram was great at sharing pictures with friends and Snapchat filtered video clips with rainbows. But, they all fail at what is currently happening one block away, right now, in real-time. Building a next-gen mobile experience, fostering frictionless and rich connections (FOMO not included)!

RUMOR gives a voice to those who wouldn't normally have one, connecting communities (not just a social app), and empowering people to connect with one another through common interests not just a random feed.RUMOR will replace traditional news media. The day 1 and entire premise is based on Stories Worth Spreading so people now have an outlet for actual local stories that matter. The TedTalks for Social Media. RUMOR is not trying to replace SnapChat, IG or FB but what we will do is provide a platform for people to save the stories that truly matter, for RUMOR.




                  How does RUMOR make money?
                  



Products - RUMOR sells Boost Points to its users who exchange them for expanded views on the RUMOR network and geographical spread of their stories.Ads - RUMOR has tested a brand new hyperlocal ads engine to bring local content directly to users targeting specific common interests. We intend to expand ads within the local businesses as we expand to maximize revenue.

Direct Marketing - Rumor has tested unique branding and marketing efforts through consulting to provide content to local business to maximize their local reach and marketing dollars. We intend to build out our BD team to further explore this source of revenue.




                  How big is the market?
                  



About 2 billion people use social networks, spending nearly $40 billion on social media advertising.




                  What's your biggest risk?
                  



RUMOR operates in a highly competitive market and are subject to rapid technological change. Our biggest risk is that we may not be able to effectively compete in some or all of these markets. To remain competitive and increase client demand, RUMOR must develop and manage successive platform releases and transitions with great execution.

RUMOR is subject to local laws and regulations worldwide. Changes in these administrative protocols could materially increase the cost of doing business, or even preclude it. The prospect of increased regulation and/or Internet censorship may create access challenges to our users and service offerings.




                  What do you tell people who are skeptical of your chances of competing with Facebook?
                  



People do not want to be on the same social network as their parents. Period. RUMOR is truly invite only so users define who gets in and who does not. The choice is simple when you look at the growth of newer social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat. People are moving toward applications that have utility from day 1 and RUMOR gives the voice back to the people in a meaningful way.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
