Properly organize your cookware and bakeware.If your cabinets and drawers don’t include handy built-ins, all is not lost. For baking sheets, use rods or handy dividers to keep them upright and separated. For measuring cups and smaller items, purchase cabinet dividers or plastic storage containers, and use pullout cabinet organizers or hanging potracks for pots and pans. When organizers aren’t an option, make things easier to find by grouping like items together, such as cups, dishes, bowls and food storage containers.Don’t take the cheap route for large kitchen appliances.Although it feels great to find a deal, there are some items that are worth the splurge. Because of their frequent use and already expensive price tag, large kitchen appliances are definitely about quality. They don’t need to be top of the line, but a good-quality refrigerator, dishwasher, oven and cooktop/range will last you for years to come, so you won’t have to worry about constantly replacing them. Smaller things, such as microwaves and coffeemakers, don’t have such big price tags, so they can be swapped with very few headaches.Easily create an eat-in kitchen.The foundation of an entertainment kitchen is having it be an eat-in, a place where friends and family can sit down with a plate or cup of coffee. If you have the space, an island is a great way to accomplish this. When you’re cooking, it can work as extra countertop space, and when it’s time to eat, bar stools can turn it into a nontraditional table. If you have a breakfast nook, add a regular-size table for a less formal dining option. If your space is too small for either, a small bistro table can have the same effect.Reserve countertop space for the important things.Even though it might be tempting, fight the urge to display all of your purchases; save some countertop space for cooking. You can keep everyday small appliances, like a toaster or coffeemaker, out for convenience, but if space is tight, it might be time to stow cutting boards and mixers (yes, even those fabulous KitchenAid mixers). Instead, think about alternative storage. When it comes to your spice rack, opt for cabinet and drawer organizers or a wall rack. And though they might be pretty, dishes and knives are best stored.Add some color in unexpected ways.Kitchen materials are often neutral colors, but there’s no need to have a blah room. Instead of going with the traditional beige or white countertop, bring in a fun, entertaining vibe by opting for a green or blue countertop; even a wood countertop would add some warmth and color to an all-white room. When you’re picking your  backsplash, think along the same lines. Tile comes in many vibrant colors, so it’s the perfect way to add a splash of red or yellow without overpowering the rest of the room. Even inexpensive items such as bright dish towels, toasters and tea kettles can help bring a stronger entertaining vibe to your space.

MARK LEFFINGWELL

The owners of The Kitchen and Tahona Tequila Bistro are planning to open new restaurants that would neighbor their respective West End Plaza eateries in downtown Boulder. The operators of The Kitchen want to open a casual pub at 1035 Pearl St., Unit 100, a space recently vacated by Abo's Pizza, while Tahona's operators are proposing a 582-square-foot "intimate" restaurant at Unit 101B inside the building, according to use review applications filed with the city this month. Both spaces are now occupied by Bobbi Ciani Salon, which is intending to move to the building's second floor and expand into spa offerings, owner Bobbi Ciani said. The thought of opening a casual pub has been floated at The Kitchen for a while, co-owner Kimbal Musk said. "(The Kitchen) doesn't open us up to a big enough community of Boulder residents," he said. "There's a lot of people out there that want the product we have to offer. What we want to do is give them something they can experience every day." Tentatively named The Kitchen Café, the eatery is expected to be more "price-accessible," and serve as a place to grab a burger, salad or beer, but also a place that has the same philosophies as the farm-to-table-focused Kitchen, Musk said. The Kitchen Café is expected to employ about 40 people. The existing operation has 60 workers. Musk and crew are under contract to buy 1035 Pearl St., Unit 100, a 3,200-square-foot L-shaped space most recently occupied by Abo's. According to their application, they would expand by 400 square feet by taking over one of the salon sites, opening the whole space into a rectangle. If the application is approved, Musk said he hopes to have the pub open by next spring. The owners of Tahona and Sushi Tora are eyeing the second salon space, which is directly across the hall from the other salon and shares a wall with Tahona. The upscale, intimate restaurant, which would share Tahona's kitchen, would be just under 600 square feet in size and is expected to serve about 15 people for lunch and 20 to 40 for dinner, according to documents filed Nov. 10. In the filing, officials note that the restaurant's food would be from sustainable and local sources; the manager would personally attend to each guest; and the wine list will be simple, unique and quality-based. "Such a unique and intimate restaurant will only complement the higher-end restaurants in the area," 1035B LLC officials wrote in the use review application. Tahona's owners could not be reached for comment.Print
