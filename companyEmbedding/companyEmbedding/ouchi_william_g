Early years and education[edit]
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. He earned a B.A. from Williams College in 1965, and an MBA from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. He was a Stanford business school professor for 8 years and has been a faculty member of the Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles for many years.
Theory Z[edit]
Ouchi first came to prominence for his studies of the differences between Japanese and American companies and management styles.
His first book in 1981 summarized his observations. Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge and was a New York Times best-seller for over five months.
His second book, The M Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge, examined various techniques implementing that approach.
Ouchi also came up with his three approaches to control in an organization's management:

Market control
Bureaucratic control
Clan control

Research regarding schools[edit]
In recent years Ouchi has turned his attention to the challenges posed for local schools by a top-down management style at the central office. He published an overview in 2003 in Making Schools Work. He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and chief of staff to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
In 2009 his book, The Secret of TSL: The Revolutionary Discovery That Raises School Performance[1] was published which explores the revolutionary potential of reducing total student load, the number of students a teacher interacts with on a daily basis over the course of a semester.[2] Ouchi's premise has the potential to change school systems across the country as local principals control more of their own budgets to make creative hiring decisions aimed at reducing to eighty the total number of students each teacher interacts with on a given day.
Other activities[edit]
In the larger community, Ouchi serves on the Advisory Board of the U.S. Commission on Presidential Debates, on the Board of Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, and on the Board of Directors of The Alliance for College-Ready Public Schools - an operator of inner-city charter schools in Los Angeles.
He previously served on the boards of Williams College, KCET Public Television, The California Community Foundation, Leadership Education for Asian-Pacifics, the Consumer Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and of the Harvard-Westlake School.
In the business community, he serves on the boards of directors of The Hilton Foundation,[3] AECOM, FirstFed Financial, Sempra Energy, and Water-Pik Technologies.

Full Text

Introduction
Theory Z is a name applied to three distinct psychological theories. One was developed by Abraham H. Maslow in his paper Theory Z and the other is Dr. William Ouchi's so-called "Japanese Management" style popularized during the Asian economic boom of the 1980s. The third was developed by W. J. Reddin in Managerial Effectiveness.For Ouchi, Theory Z focused on increasing employee loyalty to the company by providing a job for life with a strong focus on the well-being of the employee, both on and off the job. According to Ouchi, Theory Z management tends to promote:
Stable employment
High productivity
High employee morale and satisfaction
History of Ouchi's TheoryProfessor Ouchi spent years researching Japanese companies and examining American companies using the Theory Z management styles .



Toyota: A Product of Japanese Productivity
Professor Ouchi spent years researching Japanese companies using the Theory Z management styes.


By the 1980s, Japan was known for the highest productivity anywhere in the world, while America's productivity had fallen drastically. The word "Wa" in Japanese can be applied to Theory Z because they both deal with promoting partnerships and group work.The word "Wa" means a perfect circle or harmony, which influences Japanese society to always come to a solution via teamwork. Promoting Theory Z and the Japanese word "Wa" is how the Japanese economy became so powerful. Because the Japanese show a high level enthusiasm to work, some of the researchers also claim that the "Z" in the Theory Z stands for "Zeal. "Ouchi's ConclusionsOuchi wrote a book called Theory Z: How American Business Can Meet the Japanese Challenge (1981). In this book, Ouchi shows how American corporations can meet the Japanese challenges with a highly effective management style that promises to transform business in the 1980s.The secret to Japanese success, according to Ouchi, is not technology, but a special way of managing people. "This is a managing style that focuses on a strong company philosophy, a distinct corporate culture, long-range staff development, and consensus decision-making" (Ouchi, 1981). Ouchi claims that the results show:
Lower turnover

Increased job commitment
Dramatically higher productivity
William Ouchi doesn't say that the Japanese culture for business is necessarily the best strategy for the American companies. Instead, he takes Japanese business techniques and adapts them to the American corporate environment.Much like McGregor's theories, Ouchi's Theory Z makes certain assumptions about workers. Some of the assumptions about workers under this theory include:
Workers tend to want to build happy and intimate working relationships with those that they work for and with, as well as the people that work for them.
Workers have a high need to be supported by the company, and highly value a working environment in which such things as family, cultures and traditions, and social institutions are regarded as equally important as the work itself. These types of workers have a very well developed sense of order, discipline, a moral obligation to work hard, and a sense of cohesion with their fellow workers.
Workers can be trusted to do their jobs to their utmost ability, so long as management can be trusted to support them and look out for their well-being (Massie & Douglas, 1992).
One of the most important pieces of this theory is that management must have a high degree of confidence in its workers in order for this type of participative management to work. This theory assumes that workers will be participating in the decisions of the company to a great degree.Ouchi explains that the employees must be very knowledgeable about the various issues of the company, as well as possess the competence to make those decisions. He also points out, however, that management sometimes has a tendency to underestimate the ability of the workers to effectively contribute to the decision-making process (Bittel, 1989). For this reason, Theory Z stresses the need for the workers to become generalists, rather than specialists, and to increase their knowledge of the company and its processes through job rotations and constant training.Promotions tend to be slower in this type of setting, as workers are given a much longer opportunity to receive training and more time to learn the ins and outs of the company's operations.The desire, under this theory, is to develop a work force, which has more loyalty toward staying with the company for an entire career. It is expected that once employees do rise to a position of high level management, they will know a great deal more about the company and how it operates, and will be able to use Theory Z management theories effectively on the newer employees.

Photograph by Vern EvansThe most pernicious management problem in the world is also the most significant. It’s the problem of designing public school systems that can educate young people for the unprecedented global society that awaits them when they come of age. If we take that problem seriously, then we need to pay attention to the research and thinking of William G. Ouchi. Bill Ouchi, age 62, is the Sanford and Betty Sigoloff Professor in Corporate Renewal at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, and a long-standing expert in organizational design.
Although he has single-mindedly pursued the reform of public school management for 25 years, Professor Ouchi (pronounced “oh-chee”) is still best known for introducing the principles of Japanese management to Western business audiences. His best-selling book Theory Z: How American Business Can Meet the Japanese Challenge (Addison-Wesley, 1981) made him famous as an advocate of such then exotic approaches as team-based management, lifelong career paths, and consensual decision making. 
Today, Professor Ouchi is one of the very few writers who can claim substantial influence in both education and business management. His 2003 book, Making Schools Work: A Revolutionary Plan to Get Your Children the Education They Need (Simon & Schuster), is based on in-depth study of the few large urban school systems that made consistent improvements in student test scores. The book identified seven elements common to good school systems: giving school principals local autonomy (as if the schools were business units), giving families a choice about which school they could send their children to, making schools accountable for student results, giving local schools control over their budgets, delegating authority as low as possible in the hierarchy, instilling a “burning focus on student achievement,” and setting up schools as “communities of learners,” where all the teachers figured out solutions together. 
Since Making Schools Work was published, its precepts have been adopted by school systems in New York; Chicago; Oakland, Calif.; and Hawaii (where Professor Ouchi was born). In 2005, Richard Riordan, the former Los Angeles mayor who was Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger’s first secretary of education, evoked Professor Ouchi’s work when he wrote, “If you made a list of people’s silver bullets for public education — smaller classes, better pay for teachers, more phonics, longer school years, no social promotions — the concept of changing governance structure would be near the bottom of the list. None of the favorite silver bullets is going to work, though, unless principals are empowered and can in turn empower teachers and parents.” 
Though Professor Ouchi’s education research has been limited to North American and Japanese schools, his points seem universal. For example, the issues of centralization help explain the difficulties that European educators have now in dealing with children from immigrant Muslim families. And his working hypothesis for schools — that they cannot succeed without local autonomy — has implications for leaders in any sort of global organization who are trying to make a difference in the world around them. 
Professor Ouchi sat down with strategy+business in his office at the University of California at Los Angeles in January 2006.
S+B: How would you describe the state of education in the U.S. today?OUCHI: It’s dire. Right after World War II, the average American felt that the public schools were excellent and that children would get a better education than their parents had received. Today, the average American gives the schools a C-minus.
S+B: Were schools in fact different then? Or is it just perception that has changed? OUCHI: Schools were very different, mainly because the students were more homogeneous. Some people will go on from there to say that the difference was cultural. They’ll say that today’s poor children come from uneducated families, where people don’t understand education and don’t care about their children. This is absolutely dead wrong.
The critical difference was this: In any industry, if you have a homogeneous product or service, your costs go down and you can deliver results more effectively. The U.S. had that homogeneous student body in the 1950s. Now, we have a tremendously diverse student body, which we’re jamming into the same old education factory that was set up for homogeneous throughput. We need an organizationally more flexible and more complex solution.
S+B: You mean we need the educational equivalent of a differentiated product line.OUCHI: That’s exactly right. Moreover, school systems are much bigger. Before World War II, we had 25 million public school students in this country and 127,000 school districts. Today, we have 50 million students and only 16,000 districts. The typical American school district today has 15 times as many students as did the typical district of World War II. No company can grow 15 times in size, not alter its structure, and continue to be effective. But our school districts have not altered their structure. They are organized and run exactly as they were in the 1950s. And they don’t work.
S+B: Why was there that much consolidation?OUCHI: After Sputnik went up in 1957, there was a hue and cry in the U.S. that Soviet children were better at math and science than American children. This was blamed on having too many small high schools that couldn’t offer advanced courses in physics and math. So we rushed to replace small school districts with big ones.
American businesses did much the same in building gigantic factories that turned out products of horrible quality. At that time, the productive capacity of every economy in Western Europe and Asia had been destroyed in World War II; virtually all manufactured products had to be bought from the U.S. American factories had 20, 30, or 40 acres under one roof. Nobody in their right mind would operate such a factory today. But we are still managing 4,000-student schools.
Failing to LEARN
S+B: What led to your interest in school management?OUCHI: It started with the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. This Olympics had been a great success. It made money. The traffic didn’t tie anything up. And it left Los Angeles with a real can-do attitude. 
Subsequently, some of the Olympic organizers formed a broad-based civic improvement group called the Los Angeles 2000 Committee. Roy Anderson, who was then the chief executive of Lockheed, was the chairman. I was asked to cochair the committee on the economy. We also had committees on pollution, health care, transportation, housing, jobs, and water and power, but at the end of this enterprise we were unanimous: Fixing the public schools outranked every other issue in determining the future of Los Angeles. All roads led back to K–12 education.
S+B: Why was that so important? OUCHI: Because if people don’t have a good education, they can’t afford even the most inexpensive housing. They can’t contribute to the cost of their own health care. They will not attract employers to locate in L.A. And on and on.
So 12 of us formed a group called LEARN: the Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now. Bob Wyckoff, then the president of Arco, and Dick Riordan, who would later become the mayor of Los Angeles, co-led it. I was the only academic member; most of the others were business leaders. We met once a week.
Our question was how to fix the L.A. Unified School District. This is the second-largest school district in the U.S., with 740,000 students. Only about 20 percent of the students in that district were performing at an acceptable level. We all felt that the problem was management: The district had become top-heavy, autocratic, bureaucratic, and unresponsive. My feeling was that every school district in America was run in the same top-down, centralized, bureaucratic way. So if managing it differently would make a difference, there was no available evidence, because no one had ever done it differently. 
I had spent 35 years studying the management of very large companies, and one of the most consistent principles is decentralization. In a competitive world, you must make decisions in the smallest operating units possible, or you will go out of business. The public school districts, of course, get students and money whether they succeed or fail. This means that they can’t fail in the traditional business sense. They can fail, but only in terms of educating their students.
Surely, we thought, if the board and the superintendent saw their management system as we saw it, then they would naturally move to create more autonomy for their “operating unit” leaders, the school principals. After all, leaders of large companies, once they see the benefits that accrue, naturally give more decision authority to people who manage the operating units. 
But after several years of intense effort, the LEARN initiative failed. No one in public education seemed to care about the way that school systems were organized — or even to acknowledge that it mattered. I was particularly disappointed by the response from academics in the education field. Most researchers who study education will tell you that 97 percent of the difference between a high-performing student and a low-performing student is accounted for by the education and income of the parents and by the training of the teacher. They will say that how you manage a school, or a school system, makes no difference. But that is obviously incorrect, and I decided to spend the rest of my career studying how to organize school districts.
S+B: What happened next?OUCHI: The LEARN group hired a team of researchers to go around the world and look for any successful example of rehabilitation of a large, urban school district. They came back in 1991 with only two. One was the charter school concept — the idea of creating semi-autonomous entrepreneurial schools within a public system. This had only been implemented in England and Canada; it had not yet come to the U.S. 
And the other was a radically decentralized school district in Edmonton, in the Canadian province of Alberta. Since 1975, school principals had controlled their school budgets, decided what staff to hire, set their own curriculum, and designed their own schedules. We were persuaded that this was the right approach; we set on Edmonton as the model to study and introduce to Los Angeles.
S+B: Did that mean persuading the school board? OUCHI: No, neither the superintendent nor the school board were interested in change at that time. We started with the president of the teachers union, Helen Bernstein. Then we went out and enrolled 700 community organizations to become trustees of LEARN. These were groups like the NAACP, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Urban League. We went through massive planning sessions with them in which, for example, Bob Wyckoff and I cochaired a workshop on governance with 75 people. Some of these meetings went from 8 a.m. until 6 at night. We revised and redrafted our plan until everyone was satisfied and all 700 community organizations signed on to it. 
S+B: Why was that important?OUCHI: Many businesspeople, especially in the 1980s, tried to get involved, just as we did, in fixing the schools. They did not want to face a labor pool of illiterates, to rely for customers on an uneducated, low-income population, or simply to watch their communities decline. With the best of intentions, they put a lot of their time and their companies’ money into the fray and they came up empty. I think they concluded that they weren’t wanted and didn’t know how to do it right, so their efforts would be better spent elsewhere. 
But in retrospect, these efforts had failed because the businesspeople saw the need for change as a logical, rational business design problem. They thought all the schools needed was some good advice. But school change was really a political process; school board members are elected, and public schools are a unit of government. We could not succeed unless we developed a politically undeniable consensus.
In 1993, we marched down to the school board with all of our organizations. We filled the auditorium. We presented the board with a box full of petition signatures. They voted unanimously to adopt our plan. But we didn’t realize that school board members can look you dead in the eye and tell you a stone-cold lie. We later found out that they turned right around and told their staff, “Don’t you dare implement that plan.”
S+B: What was threatening about this plan to this school board?OUCHI: Any school board is threatened by the idea of granting power to the principals and teachers. That means the central office bureaucrats lose power, and they will not do it voluntarily. 
Decentralize or Perish
S+B: Theory Z, which came out in 1981, had made a similar case to corporations, hadn’t it? OUCHI: Yes. In retrospect, the core of our argument was the simple recognition that human beings have limited computational ability. None of us is smart enough to tell our subordinates how to do their jobs, so everyone must delegate authority down. But you cannot do that effectively unless you also put in place an accountability system that gives you adequate control, which is not easy to do. It takes thought, time, and investment. But the rewards are great. 
This is based on research conducted on the American corporation since the mid-1950s by sociologist Peter Blau at the University of Chicago, by the Aston Group in the United Kingdom, by myself, and by many others. We all consistently found, in every industry and country, that there is a limit to the size of an effective organization. If employees essentially perform repetitive tasks, like assembly-line work or telemarketing, the maximum effective size is about 1,500 people. If employees are professionals, like consultants, accountants, doctors, lawyers, or teachers, then the maximum effective size is about 150. Larger sizes produce the pathologies of centralization, rising general and administrative costs, rigidity, and bureaucracy. And the only antidote is local unit autonomy: Decentralize or perish.
S+B: Was there a difference between your message to business leaders in the 1970s and what you would go on to say to the education leaders in the 1990s?OUCHI: In the domain of management, the message was the same. But schools are not businesses. First, community leaders — business leaders and community group members alike — have no jurisdiction. You can be smart, rich, and energetic, but only the school board, a small group of people elected every few years, has any power to change the situation. Back in the 1970s, there was a widespread movement called school-based management, where committees of parents and teachers and community members diagnosed school problems and recommended solutions. But they had no power to change anything, and by the 1990s, they had all drifted away. 
Second, education is the most emotionally charged realm imaginable. People care about their children even more than they care about their money. A child has only one shot at first grade, and if you ruin that year, you’ve made a big dent in his or her life prospects. So you cannot experiment with schools, nor should you be able to. You cannot say, “I’m not sure this is going to work, but I’m going to reorganize your school.” And especially in cities, public schools serve those who have no choice. The city of Detroit, at its peak, had 320,000 public school students. Today, it has 120,000. Everyone who could leave the schools has left them. 
Third, issues of race and religion lie at the heart of our public schools. Why would poor or Latino parents trust a wealthy white man from a giant company to actually care about their children? Why should they trust him and take his advice? That’s a reasonable question. So, if you are a businessperson trying to change the schools, you have to commit to be involved long enough for community leaders to get to know you and decide they can trust you. Until that happens, I don’t know how you can possibly be effective.
Attractive School Leadership
S+B: What happened after you realized that the L.A. school board wouldn’t implement your proposal? OUCHI: Local community support was necessary but not sufficient; we would have to build an ironclad case. So we went back to research — to the study that I ultimately wrote about in Making Schools Work. We hypothesized that local autonomy is imperative in a large school district, just as it is in a large company. By 1994, there were three school districts in North America with local school autonomy: Edmonton, Houston, and Seattle. So I compared them against the three largest U.S. districts, which were New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
We interviewed a 5 percent sample of the school principals in each district; 66 principals in New York City, for example. We went through each one’s budget, and found that in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, principals respectively controlled 6.1 percent, 6.7 percent, and 19.3 percent of the money spent in their schools. Then we went to the three decentralized districts. In Seattle, principals controlled 69 percent of the money. In Houston, 80 percent. And in Edmonton, 91.7 percent.
S+B: Just for the sake of comparison, what would a typical corporate business unit manager control?OUCHI: Of the money spent in that unit, close to 100 percent. I’m not including the money spent by the district’s central office, which constitutes 30 percent of the budget of a large urban school system. Incidentally, no business could survive at that rate. 
Then I found that, indeed, the districts with local autonomy showed higher student performance and a smaller achievement gap between white and Asian students on the one hand and Latino and African-American students on the other. In short, if you go to local school autonomy, student performance gets better. I wrote about this in my book, and today, in part because of that book, eight school districts in the U.S. are implementing local school autonomy.
S+B: Only eight.OUCHI: Well, listen to who they are. Boston, New York City, Oakland, and Chicago are each launching programs. San Francisco and St. Paul have had district-wide local school autonomy for six years; Seattle and Houston for 10. Hawaii is introducing a state law mandating local school autonomy, which I helped draft. And Dick Riordan, who was California’s secretary of education until June 2005, managed to pass a similar law for the state. 
The results prove the concept. Boston has only 19 schools in its program, all in hard-core high-poverty areas. They issued a report in January 2006 that shows that those 19 schools far outperformed the other schools in Boston in student performance. In New York City’s “autonomy zone,” as Chancellor Joel Klein calls it, there are 48 schools where the principals control 100 percent of the money. They have been so successful that New York is increasing the number of autonomous schools to 200 in September 2006.
S+B: Why does giving principals control over the budget make such a difference? OUCHI: We have a research project under way now in which we’re interviewing 527 principals with local autonomy and visiting their schools. We’re focusing on inner-city high schools, which have proven in the past to be the hardest schools to improve. We’re finding that control over the budget gives principals control over three key school decisions: the staffing mixture, curriculum, and schedule. 
The most important single indicator of a school’s quality is a metric you’ve never heard of: total student load. It’s the number of classes a teacher teaches times the number of students per class. In New York City, by union contract, a teacher may teach up to five classes, and a class may have up to 32 students, for a total load of 160. English teachers at Bronx Science, one of the greatest high schools in America, have to figure out how to comment on the essays of 160 students. In Los Angeles, the total load is 200; in some districts, it’s as high as 240. Then visit an elite private school, like those where many of your readers send their children. The total load is 55 to 60. 
In October 2005, I visited pilot senior high schools in Roxbury and South Boston — hard-core, inner-city neighborhoods. Both had total loads of 53. Each teacher handles two classes of 20 students each and a writing workshop of 13 more students. The teachers meet three times a week and they discuss each student one by one, because they know every student well.
A young woman at an autonomy school in New York said to me, “When I came here, I was always getting into fights. But at this school, everybody knows who you are. You can’t get away with that kind of thing.”
S+B: And why would the total student load drop simply because the principal is more powerful? OUCHI: First of all, the principal is the key to every school. A strong principal attracts strong teachers. Then, when you give autonomy to the principal, the principal has no choice but to consult with the teachers. And they invariably decide they don’t want a large school of 3,500 students. It’s unmanageable. So they break it down into small schools, each with its own principal, bell schedule, and teaching staff. 
Next, they get rid of administrative overhead. New York City has 75,000 credentialed teachers, but only 50,000 of them are in the classroom. When you give principals autonomy, they put their resources into the classroom. Everybody teaches. There’s no registrar; a teacher handles scheduling. There’s no dean of discipline or guidance counselors. They also dump the seven-period, five-day-a-week class schedule, which nobody likes; it produces a tremendously inefficient use of the scarce teacher resource.
Then they innovate. At one school I visited, the math and science teachers set up a combined program. They all went to night school to get credentialed in both disciplines, and then they created a joint course, team-teaching twice a week in a three-hour block. The students got more class time, and the teachers were in class a bit longer, but they each had half as many students as before. What teacher wouldn’t sign up for that? 
S+B: Some parents might want to keep to the old system, with more advanced math and science. OUCHI: That’s why you also need school choice. Every one of these districts has a system where students can attend a variety of schools without a waiver from the central office. If schools are oversubscribed, they run lotteries, giving preference to neighborhood children. This introduces a healthy form of competition; no principal wants a school that’s 30 percent empty.
I visited an elementary school in Seattle where they established a core objective: Every child, including those from non-English-speaking families, must read English well by third grade. They hired 12 reading and math coaches, drawing on retired teachers who could work part-time without benefits. They changed the curriculum as well. The result was a flying squad, moving from classroom to classroom, working with groups of five to seven students at a time. In that school today, black and white children have identical reading scores and 100 percent of them are at or above grade level.
Autonomy and Accountability
S+B: In your book, you name two other key elements: the “burning focus on student achievement” and making everyone accountable for student performance. OUCHI: They’re very important. You can have a great decentralized system, but if you don’t focus everyone’s attention on student achievement, performance will not go up. This means that principals cannot have tenure. Their continued employment and compensation should depend on whether or not students achieve.
S+B: What about teacher tenure?OUCHI: To me, teacher tenure is a good thing. American businesspeople tend to blame tenure and teachers unions. That’s a mistake. People don’t go into teaching to make money. Scratch the most cynical, battle-scarred teacher, and the idealist is still there. And that’s what’s going to save us. Teachers support new ideas when they prove out. Richard Stutman, the president of the Boston teachers union, had led opposition to our pilot schools there because he opposes differential teachers’ pay. But he was quoted in Education Week in January 2006, saying, “We are committed to what works well. We see the need for pilot schools to grow and expand.”
S+B: Your views on accountability were linked with U.S. Secretary of Education Rodney Paige, who was superintendent of the Houston school district when you were researching Making Schools Work. Inevitably, you’ve been associated with Secretary Paige’s program “No Child Left Behind,” where schools are judged by the performance of their students on national standardized tests. And that’s put you in the middle of a firestorm. OUCHI: I think the firestorm has subsided somewhat. People were willing to write off examples of success in Houston and Canada, but now when they see the effect of accountability in Boston, Chicago, and New York City, they have to take it seriously. 
The issue at the heart of this is balancing autonomy with accountability. It’s just like in a business. What allows a huge company to give a division general manager autonomy? It’s the fact that you can measure profit and loss, never with perfection, but pretty clearly. Then, if you’re a central office bureaucrat and you order a division manager to do something contrary, he or she can reply, “I’m maximizing profit right now. Are you saying you want me to sacrifice profit?” No bureaucrat can withstand that argument. 
So for a school system to succeed, there must be a simple, unassailable measure of performance. In the Edmonton approach, which became our model, there were three legs of the accountability stool. First is the measures of student achievement on standardized tests, which is now legally required in the U.S. under No Child Left Behind. Second, they must stay within budget. In other words, if a school runs a deficit, the principal must repay that money out of his or her own budget in the future. If he runs a surplus, he or she gets to keep and spend it in that school in future years. 
And third, there must be some other kind of consumer transparency as well. In Edmonton, every child in grades 1 through 12 fills out a simple, two-page anonymous questionnaire every year. “Is the school safe? Do you like coming here? Are the teachers trying to help you? Do the other children make fun of you? Do you use computers in class?” Teachers, custodians, and other school employees fill out other questionnaires: “Is the school building properly maintained? Are there adequate books and materials? Do you have adequate opportunity to influence the decisions that affect your work? How would you evaluate the leadership provided by your principal?” And parents have theirs: “Is the school welcoming? Is it properly maintained?” Principals fill out questionnaires about the responsiveness and quality of service they get from the central administration and its staff. All of these results are published publicly. 
Everything is open. You cannot escape from that kind of accountability. Nobody who is unable to perform can withstand that kind of public scrutiny.
S+B: Should measures like that have been part of No Child Left Behind as well?OUCHI: I don’t know if America was ready. You first need to have New York and Seattle and some other places try it, and let people see how it works.
S+B: Has your view on accountability changed in the three years since Making Schools Work was published? OUCHI: In the wake of the Sarbanes-Oxley earthquake in American business, I have come to realize that there are no reporting standards in the education business. When senior executives at Enron, Tyco, or WorldCom filed fraudulent reports to the shareholders, they faced criminal prosecution. If a superintendent and a school board file fraudulent reports about the progress of their district, nothing happens. It’s not a crime. There are no penalties. 
Take spending, for example. In every district we study, my team and I always find that school districts spend 30 to 50 percent more per student than they report to the public. The graduation rate in big cities, like Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, runs about 50 percent, but those cities all reported 88 percent. If a student stops coming to school, they typically send a letter recommending that the student enroll in a GED program; and then they stop counting that individual as a student. They don’t have to follow up and find out if the student received the letter, let alone whether he or she acted on it. 
Finally, districts commonly test only 60 or 70 percent of their students, the good test takers, and report that result as their performance. That was the point of the No Child Left Behind law. Now schools are required by law to test 95 percent of all groups — white, black, Latino, Asian Pacific, Native American, English learning, and special-education children — and report all the results to the public. It’s creating a furor, because people for the first time are finding out what’s going on and they are horrified.
Making a Difference
S+B: Those results drive many businesspeople to suggest that schools should be privatized, through vouchers and similar structural solutions. What’s your opinion? OUCHI: There are 50 million public school children in America. Fewer than 30,000 of them are on vouchers. Why are we even discussing this? We have had two initiatives on the ballot in California to establish a voucher system. The first one had a campaign budget of $50 million and lost 70 to 30. The second one had a campaign budget of $70 million and lost 70 to 30. There is a message here: The public doesn’t trust vouchers. They believe that one way or another, perhaps in a way we cannot presently anticipate, vouchers will produce a vastly more economically segregated schooling system than we have even now. 
My guess is that when competing schools, including charter schools, private schools, and religious schools, get a share above 20 percent of the local student population, they will become a genuine competitive threat to the district establishment. And then schools improve. But it doesn’t have to be private competition; I’m all for charter schools. In Seattle, by the way, 47 percent of the children attended private school in 1995. Public schools have taken back eight market share points from them since then.
S+B: What would you suggest to a businessperson who wants to make a genuine difference in education? OUCHI: If you go on the board of a company for the first time, what’s the first thing you do? You get to know the articles, the bylaws, the P&L, the cash flow, and the balance sheet. You need to do the same with schools. Businesspeople haven’t a clue how much their school district spends per child. They don’t know the graduation rates or the test scores. Instead, they walk into a classroom and say, “I want to help.” How naive. 
Even if you ask for the information, it’s hard to get, because the district doesn’t want you to know how badly they are doing. They typically have six, seven, or eight incompatible legacy information systems, which might use the same general ledger account number to refer to completely unrelated activities. Talk to whoever audits your company, and you’ll find they have probably conducted an audit of the local school district. They will tell you the information systems are hopelessly unfixable. The only thing to do is blow them up and start over again. This is very much a size-related phenomenon. The smaller the school system, the less of a problem they tend to have. 
S+B: Do you see the same problems outside the United States? OUCHI: Nobody else seems to have school districts as big. Even metropolitan Tokyo, which has 30 million people, is divided into 28 wards, each with its own school board and school system. The curriculum is mandated at the national level, but the use of the curriculum, the staffing mixture, and the schedule are up to the principal. And no two schools are alike. They’re all different, given that flexibility.
S+B: As China and India enter the developing world, as Europe becomes more urban, will other countries face the same kinds of problems?OUCHI: Yes. I get questions all the time from people in China, in particular, where the public is growing more demanding of its public schools. Schools in China are typically part of the municipal government and very centralized. But the winds of change in education are blowing in China — and everywhere else.

William Ouchi 

William G. Ouchi (born 1943) is a researcher in the field of business management, an American professor and the author of famous management book Theory Z.
 
William Ouchi first came to prominence for his studies of the differences between Japanese and American companies and management styles. His first popular book in 1981 summarized his observations. Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge made the 'best-seller' lists, and remained there for five months. His second book, The M Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge, examined various techniques implementing that approach.
 
William Ouchi proposed 3 approaches to control in an organization's management:
 
Market control
Bureaucratic control 
Clan control
 
In recent years William Ouchi has turned his attention to the organization and effectiveness of schools and issues of school district administration. He published an overview in 2003 in Making Schools Work. He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served in the administration of former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
 
In Theory Z, Ouchi describes the art of Japanese management and shows how it can be adapted to American companies. He takes readers behind the scenes at several U.S. corporations making the Theory Z change and shows step-by-step how the transition works. Ouchi also examines the corporate philosophies that have become blueprints for Theory Z success, and looks at the evolving culture of "Z" people in society.
 
Professor Ouchi's new theory of management promises to change the way managers and employees alike think about their jobs, their companies, and their working lives. Theory Z, according to the best management minds in America, will soon take its rightful place in everyone's business vocabulary.
 
Biography of William Ouchi
William G. Ouchi is the Sanford & Betty Sigoloff Professor in Corporate Renewal at The Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA. He previously served as Vice Dean of the school and as Chair of the Strategy and Organization Area of the school. He is the author of four books and of scholarly articles on organization and management. His first book was Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge (Addison-Wesley, 1981). Theory Z was on the best seller list for five months, has been published in 14 foreign editions, and ranks as the seventh most widely held book of the twelve million titles held in 4,000 U.S. libraries. His second book, The M-Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge (Addison-Wesley, 1984), reports on a three year effort by a team of 16 researchers led by Professor Ouchi. The M-Form Society has appeared in four foreign editions to date. His third book, Organizational Economics (Jossey-Bass, 1986), was co-edited with Jay B. Barney. His fourth book, Making Schools Work, will be published in September of 2003 by Simon & Schuster.
 
Dr. Ouchi was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii, where he graduated from the Punahou School in 1961. He received his B.A. at Williams College (1965), his M.B.A. at Stanford (1967), and his Ph.D. in business administration at the University of Chicago (1972). He has been a member of the faculties at the University of Chicago, Stanford University, and UCLA from 1979 to the present. During 1993-95 he served as advisor and then as Chief of Staff to Mayor Richard Riordan in Los Angeles. From 1996-1999 he served as Vice Dean for Executive Education of the Anderson School.
 
At UCLA, Professor Ouchi teaches courses in management and in organization design. He was Co-Chair of the UCLA School Management Program. He continues as Chairman of the Riordan Programs, which serve minority high school and college students in Southern California and also is the founder of the Nissan-HBCU Summer Institute, which serves the professoriate of the Historically Black Colleges and Universities of the U.S. He is Chair of the George and Kimiko Nozawa Endowment, which grants scholarships to students from Japan. Professor Ouchi also serves on several other committees and boards of the Graduate School of Management, supervises doctoral candidates, and carries on his own research on the management of K-12 schools.
 
In service to the profession, Professor Ouchi has served on the editorial boards of four scholarly journals and serves as advisor to several granting agencies. He serves on the boards of AECOM, KCET public television, Allegheny Technologies, Water-Pik Technologies, FirstFed Financial, Sempra Energy, The Japanese American National Museum and the Advisory Board of the Commission on Presidential Debates. He also serves on the board and is past Chair of Los Angeles Educational Alliance for Restructuring Now (LEARN) and past Co-Chair of the Los Angeles County Alliance for Student Achievement. He is an advisor to the Joint Senate-Assembly Committee on Preparing California for the 21st Century, and is a past member of the Consumer Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Executive Advisory Board of the Asian Business League of Southern California. Professor Ouchi resides in Santa Monica, California with his wife. They have three children.

Publisher's Description▼▲
From the author of the acclaimed and influential Making Schools Work comes Untitled on Education, a guide to the revolutionary reforms that are changing public education in some of the nation’s biggest cities.  • Builds on the author’s growing reputation. Making Schools Work influenced New York City Schools Chancellor Joel Klein’s effort to radically decentralize the nation’s largest school system. Seven of the ten largest school districts in the u.S. have now implemented the decentralization championed in that book.  • Based on a groundbreaking study by the author. Ouchi studied 442 schools in Boston, Chicago, Houston, New York City, Oakland, St. Paul, San Francisco, and Seattle that have embraced school decentralization. He shows how decentralization has improved school performance as measured by standardized tests.  • Explains the key to school success. Principals must be given control of their budgets and other authority. When they are empowered, they allocate funds to increase the number of teachers and lower the Total Student Load (TSL) per teacher. TSL is the key factor in school performance. Principals with autonomy invariably lower their school’s TSL.


Author Bio▼▲
William G. Ouchi is the Sanford and Betty Sigoloff Professor in Corporate renewal at the Anderson Graduate School of management at UCLA. He is the author of several books, including the bestselling Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge. He lives in Santa Monica, California.

Estudios sobre las diferencias entre las empresas Japonesas y Estado Unidenses y los estilos de gestión. BiografíaWilliam G. Ouchi nació en 1943 es un profesor norteamericano y autor en el ámbito de la gestión empresarial.Introducciónlike   comment   shareWilliam OuchiLa administración de empresas se enfrenta día a día a distintos desafíos, buscando aumentar la eficiencia en la productividad. Entre estos, cobra especial relevancia la administración de las personas que laboran en la misma organización, en una búsqueda que ha llevado a la adopción de distintos conceptos, como recursos humanos, capital humano, etc. Ante esta situación, la mirada de las empresas se dirige hacia Japón, país donde existe una particular manera de trabajar este aspecto de la administración, en un enfoque que se ha denominado Teoría Z, en la cual se enfatiza el rol de los empleados en su calidad de personas. ¿Se podrá aplicar la Teoría Z en un ambiente como el occidental, y específicamente el ambiente chileno? Esa es la pregunta que busca responder este documento, a través de una investigación teórica y de la aplicación parcial de algunos de sus postulados en organizaciones locales, con lo cual se busca elaborar una propuesta para insertarlos en nuestra administración para una responsabilidad comunitaria como base de la cultura organizacional y con la cual poder contribuir a fortalecer la productividad dentro de la empresa.William OuchiFotosLa Teoría zes una teoría de excelencia ya que La noción de Excelencia Organizacional surge como un ámbito conceptual y estratégico en las ciencias de la administración en la década de 1980, que se caracterizó por el impacto de tres nuevos modelos teóricos de la administración, estrechamente vinculados. El primero de ellos fue el "milagro japonés" y el énfasis en la calidad (desde Shigeru Kobayashi 1972 y William Ouchi 1982).En nuestra disertación conoceremos lo que es la Teoría Z y sobre que trata esto, gracias a esto podremos conocer en que puede ayudar a las personas en el ámbito laboral y a las empresas en su producción que veremos más adelante. Son 3 los pilares fundamentales para obtener la máxima productividad en la organización.Los cuales son: 1. Confianza.2. Sutileza.3. Intimidad.La Teoría Z sugiere al ser humano integral y a la humanizaciónSe caracteriza por:   • Trabajo en equipo.• Objetivos compartidos.• Se disfruta lo que se hace.• Empleo a largo plazo.• Toma colectiva de las decisiones.• Responsabilidad colectiva.

                              Drawing on the results of a landmark study of 223 schools in six cities, a project that Ouchi supervised and that was funded
                              in part by the National Science Foundation, Making Schools Work shows that a school's educational performance may be most

Markets, Bureaucracies, and Clans
William G. Ouchi (1980)

The text „Markets, Bureaucracies, and Clans “ written by William G. Ouchi in 1980  describes these three modes of control for forming an organization. At first William G. Ouchi aks the question what an organization really is. He refers to different authors, who are answering this question. At first he refers to March and Simon’s (1958) who a taking the aspect in consideration, that an organization “will exist so long as it can offer its members inducements which exceed the contributions it asks of the”.  His second source, which he considers to be the most recent explanation for an organization is Blau and Scotts (1962): “a purposive aggregation of individuals who exert concerted effort towards a common and explicitly recognized goal”.  Furthermore he uses quotes of Coase (1937) and Williamson (1975) to picture the nature of organizations. In the following Ouchi underlines transaction cost as solution to the problem of cooperation of economic aktivities. He describes the price mechanism in a market relationship where placing a value on each contribution is the most important aspect. Every party wants the deal to be equitable. This demand for equity brings on transaction cost. Transaction cost is any activity which leads to a satisfaction of both parties. The party who is delivering his goods and those party which receives the goods and pays for these goods. Higher transaction cost is to be expected when it is difficult to determine the value of the goods or the service. This happens because of the lack of trust between the parties. When this is the case a third party is arranged to value the good whichever is demanded.  This same problem arises when a service is the objective of the exchange. In this case Ouchi names three mechanism to mediate this transactions: a market, a bureaucracy and clans. He argues that market and bureaucracies received the most attention, but clans are...

Participative Management Styles: Theory Z - William Ouchi
During the 1970s, when Japanese-style management was all the rage, William Ouchi, took the Theory X, Theory Y concept one step further: Theory Z. This is the participative model. Ouchi was born and educated in America, but was of Japanese descent. He visited Japan and studied their
 success with team and participative management and developed this theory.

Assumptions about: Workers' motivation.

Theory X The Theory X manager assumes that the only motivation that works for employees is $$money$$.

Theory Y The Theory Y manager assumes that employees are motivated by their needs to fulfill their social, esteem, selfactualization, and security. The Theory Y manager believes that employees see work as a natural activity and will seek out opportunities to have increased responsibility and understanding of their tasks. The Theory Y manager believes that workers will respond best to favorable working conditions that do not pose threats or strong control.

Theory Z The Theory Z manager assumes that employees are motivated by a strong sense of commitment to be a part of something worthwhile -- the self-actualization need. The Theory Z manager believes that employees will not only seek out opportunities for responsibility, in fact, they crave opportunities to advance...

Bureaucracy

MGMT 610 Section 9041

     The term bureaucracy became known in the late 1800’s thanks to a German theorist named Max Weber.  Weber “perceived bureaucracy as a threat to basic personal liberties, and recognized it as the most efficient possible system of organizing” (Daft, 2013, p. 363).   Merriam-Webster’s dictionary defines
 bureaucracy as “a body of nonelective government officials; an administrative policy-making group; or a system of administration marked by officialism, red tape, and proliferation” (Merriam-Webster’s, 2004, p. 165).   Within any organization there has to be a clear cut set of rules and regulations to adhere to.  Who will determine these regulations and rules?  The employees, management, and the board of directors will all come together at one time or another to create them.  
     In my line of work, for personnel to have access to a computer they have to fill out a request form, have their security clearance verified, and take the information assurance (IA) awareness training course.  Once this is complete, the form is provided to our division and then their account is created.  As of a few months ago my place of employment went under contract through another company for the network and there have been numerous steps added to the process.  Now employees must fill out the form along with two other...

...Introduction: 
Bureaucracy literally called ‘rule by officials’, which is an administrative machinery of the government. Accordance with the division of functions and positions, hierarchical management principles established system of administrative power.
Bureaucratic systems were to be structured hierarchically, with those at the top having far greater power and discretion than those at the bottom. 
There are four structural concepts are central to any definition of
 bureaucracy:
 1. A well-defined division of administrative labour among persons and offices,
 2. A personnel system with consistent patterns of recruitment and stable linear careers, 
 3. A hierarchy among offices, such that the authority and status are differentially distributed among actors, and 
 4. Formal and informal networks that connect organizational actors to one another through flows of information and patterns of cooperation. 
In bureaucracies, people were grouped with those who did the same work. There was a workgroup leader and a number of people who reported to the leader. 
The workgroup leader planned, allocated, controlled and coordinated the work. 

Characteristics of modern bureaucratic system
According to Weber's summary, the modern bureaucratic system has the following characteristics: 
1.	Normative, inside a fixed and official jurisdiction has theoretical principles, the principle of this theory generally provided for accordance with...

...Bureaucracy
Bureaucratic management may be described as "a formal system of organisation based on clearly defined hierarchical levels and roles in order to maintain efficiency and effectiveness.
A Bureaucracy is "a body of nonelective government officials" and/or "an administrative policy-making group."[1] Historically, bureaucracy referred to government administration managed by departments staffed with nonelected officials.[2] In modern
 parlance, bureaucracy refers to the administrative system governing any large institution.[3][4][5][6][7][8]
Since being coined, the word "bureaucracy" has developed negative connotations for some.[9] Bureaucracies are criticized for their complexity, their inefficiency, and their inflexibility.[10] The dehumanizing effects of excessive bureaucracy were a major theme in the work of Franz Kafka, and were central to his masterpiece The Trial.[11] The elimination of unnecessary bureaucracy is a key concept in modern managerial theory,[12] and has been a central issue in numerous political campaigns.[13]
Others have defended the existence of bureaucracies. The German sociologist Max Weber argued that bureaucracy constitutes the most efficient and rational way in which human activity can be organized, and that systematic processes and organized hierarchies were necessary to maintain order, maximize...

...ABSTRACT

Bureaucracy is all about the rules and regulations to manage a particular activity in the organization. This paper is about how bureaucracy used in old organizations and how it affected the processes of new organizations. It explains how bureaucracy is not applicable in today’s business environment because of many facts. As years went through there was a drastic change in the operations of the organisation. The concern moved from
 organization to customer service, so the bureaucratic organizations changed their strategy from bureaucracy to customer service, this include government organizations also. Different authors thought about issue the issue different and this is explained in a very lucid language in this paper.

INTRODUCTION TO BUREACRACY

In the 18th century, officials of the French government demoted bureaucracy as desk cloth cover. Bureau means the official body which is engaged in the office which is public. This body uses the required implemental material and files. The term bureaucracy derived from the word bureau. (Reinhard Bendix,1968)

According to Blau(1965), bureaucracy is defined as “The type of organization designed to accomplish large scale administrative tasks by systematically coordinating the work of many individuals.” However, Weber(1958) defined bureaucracy in a very scientific and systematic way. This means that...

...What is bureaucracy?
The word "bureaucracy" stems from the word "bureau", used from the early 18th century in Western Europe not just to refer to a writing desk, but to an office, i.e. a workplace, where officials worked.

1.	A system of government in which most of the important decisions are made by state officials rather than by elected representatives.

2.	A state or organization governed or managed according to such a system.

3.	An administrative or
 social system that relies on a set of rules and procedures, separation of functions and a hierarchical structure in implementing controls over an organization, government or social system. Large administrative staffs are most common in large organizations that need standardized rules and procedures or consistency across a wide range of business activities.


“Characteristics of Bureaucracy”
Bureaucracy refers to the management of large organizations characterized by hierarchy, fixed rules, impersonal relationships, rigid adherence to procedures, and a highly specialized division of labor.
Weber suggests the characteristics of bureaucracy as following :
1. There is the principle of fixed official jurisdictional areas, which are generally ordered by rules, that is, by laws or administrative regulations.
2. The principles of office hieararchy and of levels of grade authority mean a firmly ordered system of super and subordination in which...

Early years and education[edit]
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. He earned a B.A. from Williams College in 1965, and an MBA from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. He was a Stanford business school professor for 8 years and has been a faculty member of the Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles for many years.
Theory Z[edit]
Ouchi first came to prominence for his studies of the differences between Japanese and American companies and management styles.
His first book in 1981 summarized his observations. Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge and was a New York Times best-seller for over five months.
His second book, The M Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge, examined various techniques implementing that approach.
Ouchi also came up with his three approaches to control in an organization's management:

Market control
Bureaucratic control
Clan control

Research regarding schools[edit]
In recent years Ouchi has turned his attention to the challenges posed for local schools by a top-down management style at the central office. He published an overview in 2003 in Making Schools Work. He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and chief of staff to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.
In 2009 his book, The Secret of TSL: The Revolutionary Discovery That Raises School Performance[1] was published which explores the revolutionary potential of reducing total student load, the number of students a teacher interacts with on a daily basis over the course of a semester.[2] Ouchi's premise has the potential to change school systems across the country as local principals control more of their own budgets to make creative hiring decisions aimed at reducing to eighty the total number of students each teacher interacts with on a given day.
Other activities[edit]
In the larger community, Ouchi serves on the Advisory Board of the U.S. Commission on Presidential Debates, on the Board of Trustees of the Japanese American National Museum, and on the Board of Directors of The Alliance for College-Ready Public Schools - an operator of inner-city charter schools in Los Angeles.
He previously served on the boards of Williams College, KCET Public Television, The California Community Foundation, Leadership Education for Asian-Pacifics, the Consumer Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Walt Disney Concert Hall, and of the Harvard-Westlake School.
In the business community, he serves on the boards of directors of The Hilton Foundation,[3] AECOM, FirstFed Financial, Sempra Energy, and Water-Pik Technologies.

Early years and education[edit]
He was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. He earned a B.A. from Williams College in 1965, and an MBA from Stanford University and a Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of Chicago. He was a Stanford business school professor for 8 years and has been a faculty member of the Anderson School of Management at University of California, Los Angeles for many years.
Theory Z[edit]
Ouchi first came to prominence for his studies of the differences between Japanese and American companies and management styles.
His first book in 1981 summarized his observations. Theory Z: How American Management Can Meet the Japanese Challenge and was a New York Times best-seller for over five months.
His second book, The M Form Society: How American Teamwork Can Recapture the Competitive Edge, examined various techniques implementing that approach.
Ouchi also came up with his three approaches to control in an organization's management:

Market control
Bureaucratic control
Clan control

Research regarding schools[edit]
In recent years Ouchi has turned his attention to the challenges posed for local schools by a top-down management style at the central office. He published an overview in 2003 in Making Schools Work. He chaired an education reform panel for Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, and some of his proposals are being considered currently. In the 1990s, he served as advisor and chief of staff to former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan.

威廉·大内(William Ouchi):Z理论创始人,最早提出企业文化概念的人

2 Z理论的发端
3 美、日企业的比较


[编辑] 威廉·大内生平简介 
　　威廉·大内（William Ouchi）是日裔美籍管理学家，是美国斯坦福大学的企业管理硕士，在芝加哥大学获企业管理博士学位。他从1973年开始转向研究日本企业管理，经过调查比较日美两国管理的经验，于1981年在美国爱迪生维斯利出版公司出版了《Z理论——美国企业界怎样迎接日本的挑战》（ZTheory）一书，在这本书中，他提出Z理论，并最早提出企业文化概念，其研究的内容为人与企业、人与工作的关系。如今，他是加利福尼亚州立大学洛杉矶分校的管理学教授。
　　在对Z理论的研究过程中，大内选择 了日、美两国的一些典型企业进行研究。在组织模式的每个重要方面，日本与美国都是对立的。但是，在美国的一些成功企业中，如IBM、普罗克特、甘布尔、柯达等，在经营管理上与日本企业有着惊人的相似之处。这些企业都在本国及对方国家中设有子公司或工厂，采取不同类型的管理方式。大内的研究表明，日本企业的经营管理方式一般较美国企业的效率更高，这与20世纪70年代后期，日本经济咄咄逼人的气势是吻合的。作者因此提出，美国的企业应该结合本国的特点，向日本企业学习管理方式，形成自己的管理方式。他把这种管理方式归结为Z型管理方式，并对这种方式进行了理论上的概括，称为“Z理论”。该书一经出版立即获得 广泛重视，成为80年代初研究管理问题的名著之一。《Z理论》一书与《成功之路》、《日本的管理艺术》、《公司文化》一起被称为美国管理“四重奏”，其中 《日本的管理艺术》作者之一帕斯卡尔曾与大内一起研究日本的管理。另外，大内的组织文化的思想对管理的发展也产生了很重要的影响。

[编辑] Z理论的发端 
　　威廉·大内从与美日企业界人士广泛的交往中得到有益的启发，在深入调查两国的企业管理现状的基础上，参照传统的X理论和Y理论，以日本企业文化为参 照系，写下了《Z理论——美国企业界怎样迎接日本的挑战》一书，将日本的企业文化管理加以归纳。本书写作的原意是“如何把对于日本企业管理的理解运用到美 国环境的实践中”，试图回答“日本的企业管理方法能否在美国获得成功”这个美国人十分关心的问题。
　　在该书中，威廉·大内首先提出美国为什么要向日本学习的问题。他认为日本企业成功的秘诀是日本的企业组织和文化，这种企业文化的核心是重视人的因素。Z理论强调管理中的文化特性，美国企业应当研究日本的企业文化并从中学习，这种文化主要由信任、微妙性和亲密性所组成，它们对于提高劳动生产率很重要。根据这种理论，管理者要对员工表示信任，而信任可以激励员工以真诚的态度对待企业、对待同事，为企业而忠心耿耿地工作，可以使企业内的部门作出牺牲以顾全企业整体的利益，关心企业劳动生产率的提高。大内认为，人与人之间的关系既复杂又微妙，微妙性是指企业对员工的不同个性的了解，以便根据各自的个性和特长组成最佳搭档或团队，增强劳动率。强迫命 令不会有微妙性，微妙性一旦丧失，劳动生产率就会下降。有了微妙性，才能降低成本，提高经济效益。而亲密性强调个人感情的作用，其会使信任和微妙性得到发 展，人们相互关心，在员工之间建立一种亲密和谐的伙伴关系，为企业的目标而共同努力。日本企业的成功，充分证明了亲密的个人感情在工作中的地位及重要性。 社会的亲密性一旦瓦解，人们就会失去对企业组织、对社会的信任，就会产生恶性循环，最终导致劳动生产率水平的降低。大内指出，日本企业内的种种“会”、 “小组”、“俱乐部”对于增进亲密性都是大有帮助的。因此，大内在他的著作中生动地概括出日本企业文化与企业经营的关系：
　　“日本企业的基本管理方法是如此微妙、含蓄和内在，以致局外人往往认为它是不存在的。……它的实质与西方企业的管理方法迥然不同。”

[编辑] 美、日企业的比较 
　　大内声称美国的企业要向日本的企业学习，这就需要对日本管理方式的那些复杂性和微妙性作更仔细的考查，对日本企业的基本性质进行调查，并借此形成一个与西方企业作比较的指南。
　　Z理论主张以坦白、开放、沟通作为基本原则来实行“民主管理”。而在当时的美国企业里，一般来说，科长、经理等企业的管理者都一致认为，他们应该自己当 担起决策的责任。大多数机构实行一种“局部关系”，即雇主和雇员之间有一种默契，他们之间的关系仅涉及与完成特定任务直接有关的那些活动，另外的其他的关 系就很少。而且工厂很多都是用对个人施行物质刺激的方法，如计件制以至与增加工资有密切关系的工作鉴定制度。美国的企业中有时即使企业的效益不好，也有可能增加员工的工资。大内把这种由领导者个人决策、员工处于被动服从地位的企业称为A型组织，他认为，当时研究的大部分美国机构都是A型组织。
　　大内称日本的管理方式为J型组织。
　　日本企业最重要的特点是终身雇佣制，这是很多日本员工的奋斗目标。它不仅仅是一个单独的政策， 而且还把日本人多方面的生活和工作结合在一起。在日本的劳动大军中大约有35%能在大企业和政府部门中享受终身雇佣制。在日本，当经济生活和社会生活溶合 成为一个整体时，个人之间的关系就变得密切。人与人之间的关系通过多种纽带相互联系，员工对企业的忠诚度非常高，它们大多数以企业为家，同事关系相处得非常融洽，当企业的效益不好时，就不用发放红利。日本企业的组织也是极其复杂的，他们的评价与晋级方式与美国企业有很大的不同，员工在进入组织后，很长一段 时间他们的待遇都是相同的，只有过了很久后才会显示出差别。这种非常缓慢的过程促进了人们以非常坦率的态度对待合作，工作表现和评价。日本企业对职工在业 务方面的培养也是非常独特的。这与美国的培养方式有很大的区别。员工在开始他们的正式的工作之前，会在多个岗位上熟悉业务，以便让他对以后所作的事情，对 公司的业务有整体的了解。例如一个大学毕业生进入银行工作，他开始时担任见习管理的职务，然而他被派到一个分支机构中去学习银行业务，后又被调回总行学习 商业银行的大宗业务，又调到另一个分支机构。这样几次之后，才可能回到他的工作岗位。这样员工就会具有多方面的才能，可以称得上工作上的专家了。日本的企业采取集体决策过程，每个有关人员都要参加。而且重要的不是决定本身，而是人们对决定负责和了解到什么程度。管理过程他们要运用统计报表、数字信息等清晰 鲜明的控制手段，又注重对人的经验和潜能进行细致而积极的启发诱导。人们树立牢固的整体观念，员工之间平等相待，每个人对事物均可作出判断，并能独立工作，以自我指挥代替等级指挥。

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
