Our Story














A Cultured History
Every story has a fundamental origin. Ours begins in the early 1960s in California with a pair of entrepeneurial siblings. Trained as plasterers, Garrett and Floyd Brown recognized the need for a new kind of building material— a stone veneer that not only mimicked the look of real stone, but actually improved upon it with a more consistent color, quality and weight.









We are masters.
Our masters excel at blending the very best of art and science, man and machine, form and function. Whether it's hand-shaping our world-class Cultured Stone® veneers, operating our equipment, or performing quality inspections, they make it all flow seamlessly.









The culture behind Cultured Stone®.
Balancing the personal with the professional, our colleagues deep respect and admiration for one another's craft is evident in the work they product together. The people who call Boral® home are very much a family— if not by direct relationship, then by a genuine shared camaraderie.











80
Since 2009, we have reduced landfill waste by 80 percent per ton of product produced


50
A leader for over fifty years we have produced over 750,000,000 sq ft of Cultured Stone® veneer


58%
Cultured Stone®veneer products contain an average of 58% pre-consumer recycled content








From Chester to Napa.
(And everywhere in between).

While the heart of Cultured Stone® by Boral®’s operations can be found in Roswell, Georgia, the lungs that breathe life into our work can be found in our two plants. Strategic locations in Napa, California, and Chester, South Carolina, have allowed us to create one of the largest distribution footprints in the US and Canada and globally into Europe, Asia and Australia.


BACK TO TOP »








We strive to meet today’s building needs without compromising the future. Cultured Stone® veneers are designed to not only beautify spaces but also take care of our shared environment along the way. To that end, our closed-loop recycling system allows us to reuse water during manufacturing, which proves especially important in California’s drought-prone environment. Cultured Stone® products also contain an average of 58 percent pre-consumer recycled content. Since 2009, we have reduced landfill waste by 80 percent per ton of product produced.
Our commitment to thinking and building green has also led us to meet the indoor air quality standards of the GREENGUARD Environmental Institute and GREENGUARD Gold. In addition, Cultured Stone® veneer is a NGBS Green Certified Product.

Carmeuse’s Specialized Product Brands
Through a strong focus and commitment to provide high-performance, cost-effective, and environmental solutions for its customers, Carmeuse is always developing products for specialized applications.  Among its more popularly used product brands, Carmeuse offers:

INJECTOLIME® -- small particles of quality dolomitic lime and high calcium lime delivered into the molten slag/metal interface using state-of-the-art injection technology in the steel industry. These particles quickly dissolve providing the steelmaker very responsive control of slag chemistry.

FERRODOLIME® -- a dolomitic pebble lime encapsulated with
iron oxide coating that reduces breakage during mechanical handling at the steel plant, and provides cost-effective and environmental benefits.

PREMIACAL® -- an engineered limestone that is a cost-effective, high-performance additive designed to improve the quality and processing of concrete. PREMIACAL® is ideal to use in Self-Consolidating Concrete (SCC) mix for optimal performance, improved appearance and increased cost savings.

ENVIROLIME® -- a composition of limestone, lime, silica and coal fly ash as a co-product generated during the production of lime. ENVIROLIME® is a highly reactive and reliable product for many applications, including in soil improvement and soil stabilization.

MIRACLE MORTA-LOK® -- preferred by professionals, a Type “S” mason’s hydrated lime with high elasticity, durability, water resistance, efflorescence control and workability.

MIRACLE E-Z SPREAD® -- an air-entrained Type SA hydrated masonry-stucco lime that adds elasticity and plasticity to mix and meets all national specifications including ASTM, UBC, BOCA, and SBCC.

FUSITE® -- a granular refractory dolomite with high resistance to heat to protect EAF refractory units resulting in greater technical performance and product quality.

DOLOPEL® -- a high density dolomite used for the production of refractory bricks.

DRYOX® -- typically used in the construction industry, an economical lime product for the remediation of soils, wastes and sludges.

			Vinyl Siding is very alluring, offering the incentive that you will never need to paint your home again once it is installed. Available in many colors, vinyl has become one of the most popular siding materials in the Unites States due to its low maintenance, durability and the fact it is very economical.  Fiber Cement siding is another maintenance free product which you can buy pre-painted or paint yourself. Durable and long lasting, Fiber Cement siding is also fireproof in addition being rot and pest proof. James Hardie pioneered Fiber Cement technology and is the world leader today. Hardie Siding is engineered to resist termites, rot, fade, warping and cracking. Hardie board is popular and a trend setter in the siding industry. Hardie board siding can mimic almost any other siding material, including cedar shingles, lap boards, and wood siding.While there are many options that homeowners have when it comes to siding, wood siding has withstood the test of time and is one of the top choices when it comes to choosing a siding material for your home. Real wood siding has a timeless, classic look that all other types try to mimic. It is easy to install and many homeowners can install it themselves, saving both time and money. Wood is also a great environmental choice, is biodegradable, and parts can be easily removed and replaced should that become necessary. Cedar siding is a wood product that is made from cedar trees and has a low environmental impact. Cedar is a hearty wood that stands up to intense weathering.  The Home Depot has a large selection of siding and supplies sure to meet your every need. With professional siding installation and knowledgeable store associates, the Home Depot is your best resource for do-it-yourselfers and professionals.
