Who We Are
 
 



Medifocus, Inc. (TSXV-MFS, OTC-MDFZF) develops and commercializes minimally invasive treatment systems used in treatment of cancerous and benign tumors, and enlarged prostate, medically known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (“BPH”).  The Company owns two technology platforms with approximately 100 issued and pending US and international patents:

1. The “Endo-thermotherapy Platform”, and
2. The “Adaptive Phased Array Microwave Focusing Platform”.

Based on these proprietary technology platforms, the Company has developed two advanced therapeutic products: the Adaptive Phased Array (APA)-1000 system for treatment of breast cancer and the Prolieve® system for the treatment of BPH. The APA-1000 uses precisely focused and controlled microwave energy to shrink breast cancer tumors without side-effects on the surrounding tissues to produce better treatment outcomes. The Company has received regulatory approvals to complete the APA 1000’s pivotal Phase-III clinical trials, the final step before marketing approval. The U.S. FDA-approved Prolieve® System is a medical device based on endo-thermotherapy that both heats the prostate and dilates the prostatic urethra. The Prolieve® System is a minimally invasive in-office treatment option for the symptoms of enlarged prostate in men.  The Prolieve® System is a revenue generating product catering to the multi billion dollar BPH market. The Company is currently focusing on marketing Prolieve® for the treatment of BPH and accelerating the APA 1000 breast cancer system’s Phase III study.
Prolieve®

Considered a true in-office therapy by Urologists because of its immediate symptom relief, little to no patient discomfort, and no need for sedation
Current Medifocus management and product development team actually designed and developed the product while at Celsion Corporation.
Existing nationwide network of nearly 250 physicians using Prolieve has been established


Medifocus’ strategy to capitalize on the proprietary Prolieve Thermodilation System is to generate recurring revenues through our mobile service and the sale of our disposable catheter kits.
APA-1000

APA system is approved by the FDA for use with radiation therapy.
Potential exists for the APA System to treat all forms of Breast Cancer and other Cancers.
APA system provides volumetric heating to treat very large solid tumors.
Unique Category-III CPT Code to position for insurance reimbursement approval.
APA system received the Investigational Testing Authorization (ITA) from Health Canada and the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the Food and Drug Administration for conducting the pivotal phase III trial for breast cancer treatment in Canada and the United States.

 
The Company’s long term goal is to deploy these technology platforms to improve outcomes and standards of care in cancerous and benign tumors treatment.

The Prolieve® System
 
 



Our Prolieve Thermodilatation System was originally developed and commercialized by the current Medifocus management, product development, clinical and regulatory teams. In June 2012, Medifocus reached an agreement with Boston Scientific for the purchase of all of the assets of its Prolieve business,including all Prolieve inventory, the Rocky Mountain Mobile Services mobile distribution assets, as well as the intellectual property associated with the Prolieve technology.
The Prolieve system provides a 45-minute in-office treatment that combines our microwave thermotherapy capability with a proprietary balloon compression technology to both heat the prostate and dilate the prostatic urethra. The purpose of the Prolieve system is to provide a relatively painless and effective alternative to drug therapy and certain types of surgical procedures to treat the symptoms of BPH.
The Prolieve system consists of a microwave generator and conductors and a computer and software programs that control the focusing and application of heat, plus a specially designed balloon catheter, and consists of two fundamental elements:
The combined effect of this “heat plus compression” therapy is twofold: first, the heat denatures the proteins in the wall of the urethra, causing a stiffening of the opening created by the inflated balloon, forming a biological stent.  Second, the heat serves effectively to kill off prostate cells outside the wall of the urethra, thereby creating sufficient space for the enlarged natural opening. In addition, the Prolieve system’s temperature (46º C to 54º C) is sufficient to kill prostatic cells surrounding the urethra wall, thereby creating space for the enlargement of the urethra opening. However, the relatively low temperature is not sufficient to cause swelling in the urethra.
The Prolieve is designed with patients’ needs and comfort in mind. In general, it does not require sedation or post-operative catheterization and provides rapid symptomatic relief from BPH. BPH patients can be treated using Prolieve in urologic offices throughout the United States. In addition, the Prolieve treatment is also made available to physicians utilizing our nationwide mobile service provider, Rocky Mountain Mobile Services.
Medifocus’ strategy to capitalize on the proprietary Prolieve Thermodilatation platform is to generate revenues through our mobile service and the sale of our disposal catheter kits.  Our Management believes, over time, Prolieve Thermodilatation will be the leading in-office therapy for treatment of BPH symptoms.

									Breast Cancer Treatment Options with Medifocus Inc.					 

Breast Cancer Treatment
 
 




Breast Cancer Treatment
The Medifocus management team has been working with researchers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who had developed, originally for the U.S. Department of Defense, a microwave control technology known as “Adaptive Phased Array”(APA). This technology permits properly designed microwave devices to focus and concentrate energy targeted at diseased tissue areas deep within the body and to heat them selectively, without adverse impact on surrounding healthy tissue.
In the treatment of breast cancer, the APA technology applies the same principal used in the MIT’s “Star Wars” program of detecting missiles.

Medifocus currently holds an exclusive worldwide license to use this technology for medical applications. Using the APA technology, we have developed the APA 1000 breast cancer treatment system intended to destroy localized breast tumors through the application of heat alone or in combination with chemotherapy. The Company has received regulatory approvals to start the APA 1000’s pivotal Phase-III clinical trials. The Company’s goal is to improve outcomes and standards of care in cancer treatment.
 
APA 1000 Breast Cancer Treatment System

The first indication of use of our APA focused microwave thermotherapy breast cancer treatment system is to treat locally advanced breast cancer (LABC), which involves large tumors that are generally treated first with chemotherapy and then by radical surgery if they do not respond to chemotherapy. Our technology can significantly improve the efficacy of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in shrinking large breast cancer tumors, improving the chance of breast conservation, and decreasing the need for radical breast surgery. Focused microwaves can be used to shrink breast tumors up to 8 cm in diameter, vastly improving the chance of breast conservation for these patients who under normal circumstances will have no option but to undergo mastectomy.
LABC with large size tumors (3-8 cm in diameter) represents a large percentage of all newly detected breast tumors in North America. The current Standard of Care (SOC) for LABC is to use neo-adjuvant chemotherapy to induce tumor shrinkage followed by breast conservation surgery (BCS) if the tumor shrinks sufficiently, or complete breast removal surgery (mastectomy) if the tumor does not respond. Currently, the rate of successful conversion to BCS is as low as about 30%.
Medifocus’ focused heat treatment technology has been proven clinically to enhance the effectiveness of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy in tumor shrinkage for LABC significantly enough to allow breast conservation surgery to become an option rather than mastectomy for a better surgical outcome and a more desirable personal outcome. The Company intends to expand the indication of use for its APA breast cancer treatment system to include the treatment for medium size breast tumors (1-3 cm), which is also a large percentage of the newly detected breast tumors. The combination of medium and large tumors represents a majority of the total number of newly detected breast tumors.
 
How the APA-1000 Treatment Works

The breast cancer treatment sector is currently split between chemical or biological agents, surgery and devices aimed at killing or removing cancerous tumors. Medifocus is well positioned to take advantage in all three treatment modalities, as demand for procedures resulting in cosmetically acceptable outcomes is growing. Medifocus’ minimally invasive, non-toxic, focused microwave technology platform is able to target and treat tumors 1 – 8 cm in diameter, unlike radio frequency devices or laser-induced thermotherapy. Additionally, the system can be used to eradicate microscopic breast tumors that cannot be seen by surgeons.
Microwave is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Microwaves focused on tumors in the breast result in localized heating of the cancer cells. Higher water content of the breast tumor relative to the surrounding fatty tissue means preferential heating of the tumor and minimal damage to healthy tissue. Microwave treatment can result in tumor necrosis, induced apoptosis (programmed cell death), or cell death — and the heat enhances the effects of the chemotherapy drug, resulting in tumor shrinkages within a matter of weeks.
Clinical studies have demonstrated that when used in conjunction with chemotherapy, Medifocus’ patented system can significantly enhance outcome, improving the expected tumor shrinkage rate by about 50 percent. When using Medifocus’ patented focused-microwave technology, a minimally invasive disposable catheter sensor is inserted into the breast under ultrasound guidance to provide feedback signals for microwave focusing and temperature measurement. The breast is then immobilized by compression, which also serves to reduce blood-flow and increase the efficiency of heat delivery for effective treatment, and microwave energy is applied to the breast via two parallel-opposed microwave applicators. A proprietary feedback, tracking, and control mechanism ensures that the microwave energy is focused on the center of the tumor, while a computer algorithm controls the amount of energy applied to the tumor, and monitors the temperature to ensure optimum effectiveness.

Additional Applications of the APA-1000 Technology
The Company also plans to file a supplemental Pre-market Approval (PMA) application to the FDA for using the APA breast cancer system for treatment of Recurrent Chest Wall (RCW) in conjunction with radiation therapy. RCW is a recurrence of breast cancer on the chest wall after breast removal and effective treatment for RCW is an unmet medical need. The APA has already received a PMA as an adjunct to radiation for treatment of surface and sub-surface cancer. Obtaining PMA for RCW will expand the market for the breast cancer system to include radiation oncology.
The Company is exploring using heat with radiation for the treatment of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), an early form of breast cancer that is currently another unmet medical need with no good treatment option. The Company is also examining the use of focused microwave thermotherapy for non-surgical ablation of benign breast tumors, a widely occurring, very painful lesion.
The future goal for Medifocus is to further expand the capabilities of its APA microwave focusing technology platform to develop and commercialize other focused heat treatment systems for surface, subsurface and deep seated tumors anywhere in the body.

  Medifocus Guidebook on Sjogren's SyndromeA Comprehensive Patient Guide to Symptoms, Treatment, Research, and Support  Updated: June 29, 2017163 Pages  What is Sjogren's Syndrome?
Sjogren's syndrome is a chronic, slowly progressive, inflammatory autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of specialized cells of the immune system called lymphocytes (T-cells in the majority of cases), monocytes, and plasma cells into the parotid (salivary) glands and lacrimal (tear) glands. These glands are part of a group of exocrine glands whose secretions pass into a system of ducts that lead ultimately to the exterior of the body.  This chronic lymphocytic infiltration interferes with the normal function of these glands and eventually results in a significant reduction or cessation in the production and secretion of saliva and tears.  The condition is named after Henry Sjogren, a Swedish ophthalmologist, who first described the primary clinical features of this disorder in 1933.
In approximately 40% of patients, Sjogren's syndrome progresses beyond the exocrine glands and systemic (extraglandular) features develop.
Two distinct forms of Sjogren's syndrome have been recognized:

Primary Sjogren's syndrome - defined as dry eye and dry mouth that occurs by itself and is not associated with another autoimmune disorder.  Primary Sjogren's syndrome occurs in approximately 50% of cases according to the Sjogren's Foundation of America.
Secondary  Sjogren's syndrome - characterized by dry eye and dry mouth that occurs in the presence of a major underlying autoimmune connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, or scleroderma.

It has been estimated that up to 4 million Americans are afflicted with Sjogren's syndrome and that 1-2% of the population in the United States has been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome.  However, because the disorder may be difficult to diagnose, the incidence of the disease may be considerably higher. Sjogren's syndrome is  a condition that affects primarily women with a female to male ratio of about 24:1, meaning that about 95% of people who suffer from Sjogren's syndrome are women.  Symptoms of the disorder most often begin between the ages of 40-60, predominantly in peri/post menopausal women, but are also seen in young women in their 20s and 30s. The average age of onset is 52 years old.  The overall prevalence of Sjogren's syndrome in the general population has been estimated to range from 0.5% to 3.0%.
Knowledge is Critical when Dealing with a Life-Altering Condition such as Sjogren's Syndrome
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, it's critical to learn everything you possibly can about this condition so that you can make informed decisions about your treatment. That's why we created the Medifocus Guidebook on Sjgoren's Syndrome, a comprehensive 163 page patient Guidebook that contains vital information about Sjogren's syndrome that you won't find anywhere in a single source.
The Medifocus Guidebook on Sjogren's Syndrome starts out with a detailed overview of the condition and quickly imparts fundamentally important information about Sjogren's syndrome, including:

The theories regarding the underlying causes of Sjogren's syndrome, which include:

Chronic inflammation
Cellular apoptosis (self-death of a cell)
Autonomic nervous system dysfunction
Neurotransmitter abnormality
Genetic predisposition

The classic signs and symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome affecting the oral cavity and the eyes.
The signs and symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome that affects other areas of the body, known as systemic or extraglandular features of Sjogren's, which may include:

Sinus symptoms
Cutaneous (skin) symptoms
Vasculitis - inflammation of the blood vessels
Pulmonary (lung) symptoms
Kidney/bladder symptoms
Gastrointestinal symptoms
Neurological symptoms
Gynecological symptoms

How Sjogren's syndrome is diagnosed based on factors such as signs/symptoms, patient history, physical examination, and examination of the oral cavity and eyes.
Special laboratory tests that are used to confirm the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome that are designed to measure abnormalities in the production of saliva and tears.

Understanding the Standard Treatments...and the Treatment Options
Currently there is no known cure for Sjogren's syndrome. The major goals of treatment are to control the symptoms and prevent or limit the involvement of other organs of the body. Understanding the standard treatments - and the treatment options - is crucial for successfully achieving the goals of treatment and, thereby, enabling the patient to maintain a reasonably good overall quality of life. As you read through the section of the Guidebook that focuses on the treatments for Sjogren's syndrome, you will specifically learn about:

The treatment options that are available to better manage the symptoms associated with dry mouth.
The treatment options that are available to better manage dry eye symptoms.
The treatment options for the management of patients with Sjogren's syndrome who manifest systemic or extraglandular involvement of other body organs such as the skin, lungs, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, or vagina.
How to better cope with the extreme fatigue that many patients with Sjogren's syndrome experience.
The prognosis (outlook) for people with Sjogren's syndrome and the important factors that can have a significant impact on predicting the outcome.
Important quality of life issues that often confront people with Sjogren's syndrome, including tips and suggestions for how to better cope with the condition.
The psychological and social impact of Sjogren's syndrome on patients and their families.
Important questions to ask your doctor about Sjogren's syndrome. 

A "One-of-a-Kind" Reference Guidebook on Sjogren's Syndrome that Goes Way Beyond the Fundamentals
Since 1996, when Medifocus was founded, we've learned that many people with Sjogren's Syndrome are seeking more specific information that goes beyond the fundamentals, such as the causes, diagnosis, standard treatments, and treatment options. That's why we developed a "one-of-a-kind" reference Guidebook that goes way beyond the basics and also includes the following sections:

A Guide to Recent Medical Literature on Sjogren's Syndrome - This section of the Guidebook contains an extensive bibliography of over 100 references to recently published articles about Sjogren's Syndrome in authoritative, peer-reviewed medical journals with links to the absracts (summaries) of the articles. These articles represent the latest advances in the field and focus on cutting-edge research, new developments, and the lessons learned from recently published clinical trials involving patients with Sjogren's Syndrome. This is the same level of that is used by doctors who treat people with Sjogren's Syndrome to keep abreast of the latest developments and breakthroughs in this specialized field of medicine.
Centers of Research for Sjogren's Syndrome - We've compiled a unique directory of doctors, hospitals, medical centers, and research institutions with special interest and, in many cases, clinical expertise in managing people with Sjogren's Syndrome. The "Centers of Research" directory is a valuable resource for quickly identifying and locating leading medical authorities and medical institutions both within the United States and other countries who are considered to be at the forefront in clinical research and treatment of Sjogren's Syndrome. You'd have to spend days - or even weeks - attempting to compile your own list of doctors and medical centers but, with the "Centers of Research" directory, the information is already right at your fingertips. All you have to do is act on the information by selecting and contacting the experts or medical institutions listed in the directory by state and country.
Organizations and Support Groups for Sjogren's Syndrome - The Guidebook also includes a directory of organizations and support groups whose goal is to help people with Sjogren's Syndrome by providing access to information, resources, and services. Many of these organizations can answer your specific questions, enable you to "network" with other patients, and provide guidance in areas such as financial, social, or medical-legal issues. This valuable directory of organizations and support groups includes complete contact information, including phone numbers and E-mail addresses.

  Medifocus Guidebook on Meniere's DiseaseA Comprehensive Patient Guide to Symptoms, Treatment, Research, and Support  Updated: June 21, 2017125 Pages  What is Meniere's Disease?
Meniere's disease is a chronic disorder of the inner ear that while uncomfortable and disruptive to quality of life, is not fatal.  All symptoms are related to dysfunction in the organs of the inner ear.  According to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Meniere's disease is characterized by four major symptoms which occur with varying degrees of intensity:

Vertigo - an intense sense of spinning. This is usually episodic and can range from mild to severe. The vertigo attacks of Meniere's disease are rotational and the duration of each episode must be at least 20 minutes in order to be classified as Meniere's disease.
Hearing loss - fluctuating low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss that becomes worse during attacks and may permanently deteriorate over time.
Tinnitus - typically a low tone ringing or roaring noise in the ears.
Aural fullness - a sense of fullness in the ear. 

Initial presentation of symptoms for Meniere's disease is variable among patients. Some people may experience a fully-developed attack of Meniere's disease with all of its symptomatic manifestations, while for others, vertigo or other symptoms may appear alone and precede fully developed Meniere's disease by many months or years. 
Some important facts about Meniere's disease include:

Meniere's disease most often affects adults between the ages of 40 to 60. Isolated symptoms can appear between ages 20and 60. It is uncommon for people older than age 60 to develop Meniere's disease.
Approximately 40,000 new cases of Meniere's disease are diagnosed annually in the United States.
Only about 3% of patients diagnosed with Meniere's disease are children.
Male to female ratio ranges from equal to a slight preponderance of females over males. Some women report improvement of symptoms following pregnancy.
In approximately 5% of cases of Meniere's disease, there is a positive family history for the condition indicating that there is a genetic component in a subset of individuals with Meniere's disease. 
Although most cases of Meniere's disease are unilateral, approximately 10-50% of patients also develop symptoms in the opposite ear.
There is no predominance of right or left ear.

Knowledge is Critical when Dealing with a Life-Altering Condition such as Meniere's Disease
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with Meniere's disease, it's critical to learn everything you possibly can about this condition so that you can make informed decisions about your treatment. That's why we created the Medifocus Guidebook on Meniere's Disease, a comprehensive 125 page patient Guidebook that contains vital information about Meniere's disease that you won't find anywhere in a single source.
The Medifocus Guidebook on Meniere's Disease starts out with a detailed overview of the condition and quickly imparts fundamentally important information about Meniere's disease, including:

The theories regarding the underlying causes of Meniere's disease.
The triggers that may precipitate an acute attack of Meniere's disease in some patients.
How Meniere's disease is diagnosed based on factors such as signs/symptoms, patient history, physical examination, and audiometric (hearing) studies.
Specific balance tests that are often used to confirm the presence of vertigo associated with Meniere's disease. These balance tests may include:

Electronystagmogram
Sharpened Romberg test 
Dix-Hallpike maneuver
Rotational test

The stages in the progression of Meniere's disease from initial signs/symptoms to severe, incapacitating vertigo attacks and complete hearing loss, if left untreated

Understanding the Standard Treatments...and the Treatment Options
Because currently there is no known cure for Meniere's disease, the goal of treatment is to control and relieve the symptoms - particularly vertigo - that patient's with Meniere's disease report as the single, most bothersome symptom. Controlling the symptoms of Meniere's disease is important because it enables patients to continue to perform routine activities of daily living and maintain a reasonably good quality of life. Understanding the treatments - and the treatment options - is critical for successfully achieving both control of symptoms and preserving quality of life. As you read through the section of the Guidebook that focuses on the treatments for Meniere's disease, you will specifically learn about:

The medications that are commonly prescribed for the management of acute vertigo attacks in patients with Meniere's disease.
A new implantable device, called the Meniett device, that delivers intermittent pulses of positive air pressure to the  inner ear and has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of vertigo in people with Meniere's disease.
The surgical treatment options that are available for patients with Meniere's disease who experience severe, unremitting episodes of vertigo that cannot be controlled with more conservative treatments. These surgical treatments include:

Endolymphatic sac surgery
Labyrinthectomy
Vestibular neurectomy

The risks, benefits, and complications, associated with the various surgical techniques that are used for the treatment of Meniere's disease.
An older treatment modality, known as intratympanic gentamicin therapy, that was abandoned for many years but has recently made a comeback as an effective treatment option for vertigo attacks in people with Meniere's disease.
The role of cochlear implants and vestibular rehabilitation in the management of people with Meniere's disease.
Nutritional and lifestyle modifications that can help you better control the symptoms of Meniere's disease.
The role of complementary and alternative therapies in the management of Meniere's disease.
Important questions to ask your doctor about Meniere's disease.

  Medifocus Guidebook on Acoustic NeuromaA Comprehensive Patient Guide to Symptoms, Treatment, Research, and Support  Updated: June 20, 2017146 Pages  What is an Acoustic Neuroma?
The central nervous system is comprised of the brain and spinal cord.  Myriads of nerves run from the spinal cord to all parts of the body in order to gather information from the environment (internal and external) which is then relayed to the brain.  One group of nerves is known as the cranial nerves.  There are twelve cranial nerves but the one of interest for acoustic neuromas is the eighth (8th) cranial nerve, called the auditory nerve or the vestibulocochlear nerve.
An acoustic neuroma, sometimes called a vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor that is located on the 8th cranial nerve which leads from the inner ear to the brain.  The auditory nerve cells, like many nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, are wrapped or insulated by layers of specialized cells called Schwann cells.   A gene on chromosome 22 directs Schwann cells to produce merlin, a protein which is also called schwannomin.  Merlin acts as a tumor suppressor preventing Schwann cells from rapidly dividing in an uncontrolled manner.   When there is an abnormality or mutation of the gene, the merlin which is produced is nonfunctional and this enables the Schwann cells to rapidly multiply and form a tumor.
Acoustic neuromas are typically slow growing (approximately 2 mm to 4 mm per year) and can usually develop over a period of years - although growth rates can vary. These rounded tumors typically appear as a single mass and are encapsulated.  At least 95% of acoustic neuromas are unilateral (occur on one side only). Unlike many other types of tumors, acoustic neuromas do not metastasize (spread) to other parts of the brain or the body.
Acoustic neuromas typically originate at a point on the vestibulocochlear nerve that is located in the internal auditory canal.  Acoustic neuroma tumors may grow for many years before becoming symptomatic.  They rarely shrink on their own and must, therefore, be observed carefully and treated after they have been diagnosed.  The growth rate ranges from no growth or slow growth to fast growing (greater than 1.0 cm/yr).  The tumor may either consistently follow one growth pattern or may alternate its rate of growth at different periods of time.
An acoustic neuroma typically remains encapsulated and as it grows it slowly displaces the surrounding tissue and nerves. The tumor first distorts the 8th cranial nerve from which it develops and then may press on the 7th cranial nerve which becomes stretched over the tumor.  If left untreated, the tumor grows to the point of filling the internal auditory canal and then may grow into the cerebellopontine angle or may begin to erode the surrounding bony structure. It takes on a pear-like shape and may begin to press on the 5th cranial nerve, the trigeminal nerve, which is responsible for facial sensation.  Although the tumor does not actually invade the brain, the pressure of the tumor can displace brain tissue.  If it compresses brain structures that control vital body functions, an acoustic neuroma can become life-threatening. 
Tumor growth rate at one year following diagnosis is thought to be a strong predictor regarding the eventual need for treatment. However, tumors that are larger than 2.5 cm at the time of diagnosis are considered more likely to grow than smaller size tumors.  In addition, an enlarged tumor may press on other nerves and alter facial sensation, swallowing, and vestibular function such as balance and hearing.  Hearing loss, which occurs in approximately 90-95% of patients, is usually caused either by compression of the cochlear nerve or the blood vessels which supply the cochlea.
It is of utmost importance for patients who are diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma to be under the care of a specialist.  Health care professionals usually involved in the treatment of acoustic neuroma may include an otolaryngologist, neurotologist (an ear-nose-throat medical specialist who obtains an additional subspecialty in conditions of the ear), neurosurgeon, radiotherapist (a specialist in radiotherapy), interventional radiologist, and audiologist. 
Knowledge is Critical when Dealing with a Life-Altering Condition such as an Acoustic Neuroma
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma, it's critical to learn everything you possibly can about this condition so that you can make informed decisions about your treatment. That's why we created the Medifocus Guidebook on Acoustic Neuroma, a comprehensive 146 page patient Guidebook that contains vital information about acoustic neuromas that you won't find anywhere in a single source.
The Medifocus Guidebook on Acoustic Neuroma starts out with a detailed overview of the condition and quickly imparts fundamentally important information about acoustic neuromas, including: 

The underlying causes of acoustic neuromas.
The risk factors that can increase a person's chances for developing an acoustic neuroma.
An overview of the relationship between a condition known as neurofibromatosis, type 2 and acoustic neuromas.
The signs and symptoms that are associated with acoustic neuromas.
How acoustic neuromas are diagnosed based on factors such as signs/symptoms, patient history, physical examination, imaging studies, and special auditory (hearing) tests.

Understanding the Standard Treatments... and the Treatment Options
The goals of treatment for patients with an acoustic neuroma include:

Preserve hearing for those patients who have intact hearing function.
Prevent the spread and progression of the acoustic neuroma tumor.
Enable patients to maintain a reasonably good quality of life.

Understanding the standard treatments - and the treatment options - is critical for successfully achieving the goals of treatment for acoustic neuromas. As you read through the section of the Guidebook that focuses on the treatments for acoustic neuromas, you will specifically learn about:

The role of "watchful waiting" (observation without treatment) in the management of people with an acoustic neuroma.
The important clinical factors that doctors take into consideration in deciding whether or not surgery is necessary for the treatment of an acoustic neuroma.
The surgical treatment options that are currently available for the management of acoustic neuromas, which include partial tumor removal and total tumor removal.
A detailed overview of the various surgical techniques that are available for the removal of acoustic neuromas, including:

Middle fossa approach
Suboccipital approach
Translabyrinthine approach

The advantages, disadvantages, and complications of the different surgical approaches for the removal of acoustic neuromas.
A comprehensive discussion regarding a non-surgical treatment option , known as stereotactic radiosurgery or Gamma knife, that has recently become available for the treatment of a variety of tumors, including acoustic neuromas.
The risks, benefits, and complications of stereotactic radiosurgery as a treatment modality for acoustic neuromas.
The prognosis (outlook) for people with an acoustic neuroma and the important factors that have a significant impact in predicting the overall chances of recovery.
Quality of life issues that often confront people with an acoustic neuroma and how to minimize their impact and cope better with these issues.
Important questions to ask your doctor about acoustic neuromas.

A "One-of-a-Kind" Reference Guidebook on Acoustic Neuroma that Goes Way Beyond the Fundamentals
Since 1996, when Medifocus was founded, we've learned that many people with Acoustic Neuroma are seeking more specific information that goes beyond the fundamentals, such as the causes, diagnosis, standard treatments, and treatment options. That's why we developed a "one-of-a-kind" reference Guidebook that goes way beyond the basics and also includes the following sections:

A Guide to Recent Medical Literature on Acoustic Neuroma - This section of the Guidebook contains an extensive bibliography of over 100 references to recently published articles about Acoustic Neuroma in authoritative, peer-reviewed medical journals with links to the absracts (summaries) of the articles. These articles represent the latest advances in the field and focus on cutting-edge research, new developments, and the lessons learned from recently published clinical trials involving patients with Acoustic Neuroma. This is the same level of that is used by doctors who treat people with Acoustic Neuroma to keep abreast of the latest developments and breakthroughs in this specialized field of medicine.
Centers of Research for Acoustic Neuroma - We've compiled a unique directory of doctors, hospitals, medical centers, and research institutions with special interest and, in many cases, clinical expertise in managing people with Acoustic Neuroma. The "Centers of Research" directory is a valuable resource for quickly identifying and locating leading medical authorities and medical institutions both within the United States and other countries who are considered to be at the forefront in clinical research and treatment of Acoustic Neuroma. You'd have to spend days - or even weeks - attempting to compile your own list of doctors and medical centers but, with the "Centers of Research" directory, the information is already right at your fingertips. All you have to do is act on the information by selecting and contacting the experts or medical institutions listed in the directory by state and country.
Organizations and Support Groups for Acoustic Neuroma - The Guidebook also includes a directory of organizations and support groups whose goal is to help people with Acoustic Neuroma by providing access to information, resources, and services. Many of these organizations can answer your specific questions, enable you to "network" with other patients, and provide guidance in areas such as financial, social, or medical-legal issues. This valuable directory of organizations and support groups includes complete contact information, including phone numbers and E-mail addresses.

Who We Are
 
 



Medifocus, Inc. (TSXV-MFS, OTC-MDFZF) develops and commercializes minimally invasive treatment systems used in treatment of cancerous and benign tumors, and enlarged prostate, medically known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (“BPH”).  The Company owns two technology platforms with approximately 100 issued and pending US and international patents:

1. The “Endo-thermotherapy Platform”, and
2. The “Adaptive Phased Array Microwave Focusing Platform”.

Based on these proprietary technology platforms, the Company has developed two advanced therapeutic products: the Adaptive Phased Array (APA)-1000 system for treatment of breast cancer and the Prolieve® system for the treatment of BPH. The APA-1000 uses precisely focused and controlled microwave energy to shrink breast cancer tumors without side-effects on the surrounding tissues to produce better treatment outcomes. The Company has received regulatory approvals to complete the APA 1000’s pivotal Phase-III clinical trials, the final step before marketing approval. The U.S. FDA-approved Prolieve® System is a medical device based on endo-thermotherapy that both heats the prostate and dilates the prostatic urethra. The Prolieve® System is a minimally invasive in-office treatment option for the symptoms of enlarged prostate in men.  The Prolieve® System is a revenue generating product catering to the multi billion dollar BPH market. The Company is currently focusing on marketing Prolieve® for the treatment of BPH and accelerating the APA 1000 breast cancer system’s Phase III study.
Prolieve®

Considered a true in-office therapy by Urologists because of its immediate symptom relief, little to no patient discomfort, and no need for sedation
Current Medifocus management and product development team actually designed and developed the product while at Celsion Corporation.
Existing nationwide network of nearly 250 physicians using Prolieve has been established


Medifocus’ strategy to capitalize on the proprietary Prolieve Thermodilation System is to generate recurring revenues through our mobile service and the sale of our disposable catheter kits.
APA-1000

APA system is approved by the FDA for use with radiation therapy.
Potential exists for the APA System to treat all forms of Breast Cancer and other Cancers.
APA system provides volumetric heating to treat very large solid tumors.
Unique Category-III CPT Code to position for insurance reimbursement approval.
APA system received the Investigational Testing Authorization (ITA) from Health Canada and the Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the Food and Drug Administration for conducting the pivotal phase III trial for breast cancer treatment in Canada and the United States.

 
The Company’s long term goal is to deploy these technology platforms to improve outcomes and standards of care in cancerous and benign tumors treatment.

										John Mon, COO of Medifocus, Inc., “Two Platform Technologies to Treat Breast Cancer and BPH”

Medifocus, Inc. Website: http://medifocusinc.com/
Medifocus, Inc. (OTCQX: MDFZF) (TSX-V: MFS.V) develops and commercializes minimally invasive focused heat systems for the treatment of cancerous and benign tumors, and enlarged prostate, medically known as Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (“BPH”). With the recent acquisition of Prolieve®, Medifocus now owns a revenue generating commercial BPH treatment product targeting the $8 billion BPH drug therapy market and generating cash flow to support the development and commercialization of other catheter based or Adaptive Phased Array (APA) based focused heat systems for targeted thermotherapy of surface, subsurface and deep seated localized and regional cancers. The Company owns two technology platforms with comprehensive US and international patent protection: 1: The Endo-thermotherapy Platform-from which Prolieve was developed can potentially used to treat cancers in prostate, rectal, cervical and esophageal, and 2: The Adaptive Phased Array (APA) Microwave Focusing Platform-invented by MIT, licensed to Medifocus, directs precisely focused microwave energy at tumor center to induce shrinkage or eradication of tumors without undue harm to surrounding tissue. The Company’s APA 1000 Breast Cancer Treatment System, developed from the APA technology platform, is currently in pivotal Phase-III clinical trials. SNNLive spoke with John Mon, COO of Medifocus, Inc. at the 2nd Annual Marcum MicroCap Conference 2013 in New York City.
“We have some very exciting technology that’s fully developed. In fact, there’s two platform technologies with over 100 patents already issued. The first technology is called Endo-thermotherapy, that’s the ability for us to deliver focused microwave heat anywhere in the body by way of natural body orifices. In fact, we already have an FDA-approved product, revenue generating, Prolieve unit for the treatment of BPH. The second technology we have is external beam microwave that also delivers focused energy. It’s exclusively licensed from MIT. It was used in Star Wars. And, we also have a very late stage product in Phase 3 FDA studies for the treatment of breast cancer,” Mr. Mon begins, “The key here is treatment. With the two platform technologies that’s fully developed products, we can actually develop future products to treat almost any site within the body…and not harm normal tissue; especially in the breast cancer technology. It’s very unique that we’re able to shrink very large breast tumors with the focus heat and also, because of the Star Wars technology, it nulls out energy to normal tissue, so it’s focused directly on the breast tumor.” When asked about reimbursement, Mr. Mon explains, “In fact, the Prolieve unit is fully reimbursed by both Medicare and private insurers.” For more information about Medifocus, Inc., check out their website. SNNLive welcomes Jon Mon, COO of Medifocus, Inc.

Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
