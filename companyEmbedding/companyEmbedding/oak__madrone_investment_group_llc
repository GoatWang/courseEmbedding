Peach
People eat lunch every day, but most of us are too busy to pack something along or pick something up. Peach solves this problem by sending a simple text each day telling you what’s for lunch. Users simply reply YES, and lunch will be delivered to their office or school. Peach finds great lunch options from the best places in town, which in turn directly benefits the restaurants by exposing them and their best dishes to new audiences. Scaling from one building on Amazon’s campus to nearly 1,800 offices in two cities has not been easy, but co-founder and CEO Nishant Singh won’t stop until everyone can text “yes” to have their lunch delivered. “I love the simplicity of the idea,” says Madrona Managing Director Scott Jacobson. “It’s the kind of straightforward marketplace that has the potential to be a vital piece of the consumer’s life and a huge business.” Nishant is also proud of the diversity of the founding team. “All three Peach founders are in the U.S. on a visa!”

Redfin
The $50 billion real estate industry is undergoing a technological transformation thanks to Redfin, whose mission to reinvent real estate in the consumer’s favor has empowered consumers and introduced fundamental changes in the client-agent relationship. Said CEO Glenn Kelman, “Redfin is made of up software engineers working beside real estate agents. It’s rare that two such disparate groups have the opportunity to learn from each other and share a common goal.” He added, “When we started, funding operationally intensive businesses like ours wasn’t very popular. But Madrona wanted to help build a company for the ages. Over the years, Madrona has given us so much more than cash. They have been confidantes, advisors and supporters in countless ways.”
MADRONA TEAMPaul Goodrich, Scott Jacobson and David Rosenthal

Rover
“I had no intention of Rover becoming a Madrona investment. I was just trying to solve a problem we had with our family dog when we went out of town,” said Madrona’s Greg Gottesman, founder of Rover. After winning Startup Weekend and putting up the original site, the team was overwhelmed with customer demand. “But the company didn’t really take off until we found Aaron Easterly, who, in addition to being an incredible CEO, is as passionate about dogs as anyone I have ever met.” Added Aaron, “Rover has always been more than a business opportunity. It’s a mission to bring the joy of pet companionship to every responsible person in the U.S.—whether they work long hours, travel frequently, or don’t have a local network of family and friends to help out with care. We’re an unholy mix of ecstatic dog nuts and analytical data geeks.”
MADRONA TEAMGreg Gottesman and David Rosenthal

Lumo Body
The vision of Lumo’s founding team is to give the body a voice. While most wearable companies are developing wrist-mounted sensors to try to measure/detect activities throughout the body, Lumo’s sensors can be deployed anywhere on the body to measure fine-grained motions and activities and give people immediate feedback to improve, whether that’s posture, or running, or golf swing, or whatever. “The name Lumo was taken from ‘illuminate,’ which speaks to the company’s goals to increase awareness of our bodies so that we can live healthier, more productive lives,” said CEO Monisha Perkash. “We chose Madrona because of their hands-on approach to helping startups. The multi-talented folks at Madrona take a sincere interest in our success and are highly accessible – we view them as part of the Lumo team!
MADRONA TEAMPaul Goodrich and Scott Jacobson

Apptio
In an increasingly complex world of IT solutions and market pressures, Apptio provides the cloud-based software that helps CIOs manage the business of IT. The company pioneered the discipline of Technology Business Management (TBM) and is the leading provider to Fortune 100 companies.   “We delivered our first version of our product using less than a million of spend and a team of 15 people,” said Apptio CEO Sunny Gupta. “Within six months we had five paying customers. This was done, when the financial crisis was in full force.” And Sunny’s thoughts on working with Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain, “Matt has been a strategic partner and advisor to us, which has been incredibly valuable at the start of Apptio through today. Madrona believed in me from the beginning, when I was an untested, first-time CEO at iConclude. I am proud of what we are building at Apptio and gratified by the support Madrona has shown over the years.”

Indochino
The great challenge for consumers buying apparel online is not knowing whether something will fit. Many companies are building technology to help consumers figure out which standard sized clothes might fit. Indochino (which started as an entrant into a student business plan competition) is taking another tack, re-engineering manufacturing in order to move from a world of mass production to one of mass customization. It’s a thorny problem, but one Madrona is excited to help solve. “Madrona is patient, invested in building great companies over the long term, and has a broader perspective than other folks,” said Indochino CEO Drew Green. “We found the team to be very experienced, both as investors and previously as operators, which has been invaluable in driving Indochino’s success.”

Jama Software
Jama is literally helping rocket ships get into space with SaaS software. Building products is exciting, but managing that process is often frustrating – Jama Software’s Product Delivery Platform is designed to help teams work better together and bring products to market more quickly.  And data shows it works – products are finished 18% more quickly. “Jama is transforming how companies conceive, build and deliver products,” said Madrona Managing Director Tim Porter. “I love the team’s maniacal customer and product focus as they build their product and create this new category of software that just makes product management work better.”
MADRONA TEAMTim Porter and David Rosenthal

Igneous
Igneous Systems is working to change the way enterprises are building and scaling data centers using the cloud. “Given that we are in stealth mode, there is little public information about us,” said CEO Kiran Bhageshpur. “That said, we are a bunch of folks who will happily tell you what we are up to, especially if you are an engineer excited about large scale distributed systems.” He continued, “Early stage investing is a very hands-on business. We wanted a partner willing to roll up their sleeves and help us build the next great Seattle company. We consider ourselves fortunate that Madrona chose to support us. Incubating in their wonderful offices was an added bonus.”
MADRONA TEAMMatt McIlwain, Tim Porter and George Huang

Highspot
Highspot is the industry’s most powerful sales engagement platform. Using Highspot, sales teams are connected to the most relevant content for each situation, have flexible ways to present content to customers, and gain real-time visibility into whether customers find the content engaging. Advanced analytics lets marketing and sales understand how content is performing across the sales cycle and provides actionable insights so pitches and content can be optimized. “We started working with Madrona in our first week, before we even had a prototype. Tim has been an excellent partner in shaping the business and has been a strong advocate throughout our development,” said Robert Wahbe, Highspot CEO.

Placed
What’s in a name? “Placed originally was called Sewichi, which loosely translates to ‘location, location, location’ in Korean,” said CEO David Shim. “We ultimately changed the name based on feedback from an advisor, who said, ‘a customer should never be afraid to mispronounce your company’s name.'” Placed provides location analytics data sources that enable mobile ad attribution and insights. The team includes leadership from previous Madrona-backed companies Farecast and aQuantive. “While working at Farecast, I saw firsthand the value that Madrona brought to its portfolio companies. Beyond the standard introductions, advice, etc., the Madrona team allowed the company to find its own way. When it came time to raise financing, it was a simple decision to work with Madrona. The firm’s commitment to our company and team is stronger than ever.”
MADRONA TEAMMatt McIlwain, Scott Jacobson  and Julie Sandler

iSpot
iSpot.tv’s software platform captures, fingerprints and captions TV commercials so they can be tracked, measured and correlated to understand audience interest.  The stellar team, led by CEO Sean Muller is disrupting big established players by bringing new transparency to advertisers that didn’t exist before.  “We obsess over technology, data accuracy and product design,” said CEO Sean Muller. “We have no preconceived notions about the space we operate in. We innovate at lightning speed. The Madrona team has a passion for industry-changing innovations and a shared vision for iSpot’s potential for leadership in the marketplace.”

Qumulo
Qumulo’s mission is to be the company the world trusts to store, manage and curate its data forever.  Founded by the inventors of the leading scale-out storage system for big data on the market, Qumulo is reinventing the next generation of large scale enterprise storage.  “Madrona is a fantastic strategic partner in building disruptive new technology businesses, ” said Peter Godman, Qumulo co-founder and CEO.  “Matt and his team take the long-term view and really roll up their sleeves and work hard to support their companies.”  “Pete, Neal, and Aaron have built an exceptional team and their initial product has had incredible market reception even when the company operating in stealth,” said Madrona Managing Director Matt McIlwain.  “Working with world-class engineers and company builders is the one of the most exciting rewards of investing early.”

Our first director of marketing was from China. We also hired two Russians and a Canadian. We are not just interested in your work experience, but your life experience.” ExtraHop has solid customers across major vertical markets and an equally solid vision for leveraging wire data to improve operations intelligence. “Madrona’s portfolio included a number of successful enterprise systems companies, so we were confident that they understood our business and could offer us guidance.”

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.

Investment Management
Insights, Strategies and Solutions
Our experienced professionals have expertise in a broad spectrum of traditional, alternative and non-financial assets.  We can work with you to develop and manage a portfolio tailored to your needs.






Portfolio Consulting
A collaborative dialogue with your portfolio manager
Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
