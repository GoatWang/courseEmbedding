For Entrepreneurs

Why Raise Capital?

Most businesses are managed through their early years by a single or small group of founders, owners or entrepreneurs. These managers often operate by experience and instinct, without formal systems or procedures, relying on their deep understanding of the business and its customers. The managers can be preoccupied with day-to-day challenges and lack the time, information or resources (including financial and human capital) to identify the drivers of growth in the business, or develop and implement strategic growth plans. As the business grows, it can encounter an inflection point where this informal system of management begins to lose effectiveness.
In the long-term, experienced private equity sponsors can achieve profound change by implementing more sophisticated strategies. These changes can strengthen a business and improve its bottom line, not only by controlling expenses, but also by growing revenue, organically and through acquisitions.




Why Choose Russia Partners?

Russia Partners supports the management of its portfolio companies, not only with capital, but also with unique insight, experience and perspective. We view our entrepreneurs as long-term partners, and strive to ensure the ultimate long-term success and viability of their business.
While the Russia Partners team will lend its expertise when appropriate, we are not looking to replace the entrepreneur when making critical business decisions. Russia Partners leaves the day-to-day management of the business to the established management team, and will supplement the team with skilled industry executives and strategic insight, when necessary.
Russia Partners has successfully implemented this strategy since its founding, providing business insight and expertise to assist its entrepreneurs in building and creating value in their businesses.
Russia Partners adds value to its portfolio companies by:

Implementing new management procedures, policies, budgets and business plans;
Augmenting senior management when necessary, including hiring top western sales and operational executives or Chief Financial Officers to improve audit and control functions;
Evaluating and implementing new systems, when necessary;
Creating, recruiting and chairing Boards of Directors and executive committees;
Assisting in merger and acquisition sourcing and evaluation;
Managing various financial transactions including securing loan facilities, refinancing/restructuring existing debt, raising equity capital and overseeing IPO processes, strategic sales or other types of potential exit transactions;
Hiring global experts to assist in making critical business development decisions, such as evaluating new site locations for expansion, etc.

Investment Strategy


Russia Partners provides long-term investment capital into Russian companies for their expansion and modernization, with the goal of increasing their capitalization and market value. This style of investing requires a hands-on, value-added approach where management of portfolio investments is as important as investment selection.Russia Partners’ goal has always been to pursue companies with unique market franchises, competent management groups, low entry valuations and the potential for a resale to a strategic investor or public offering. Industry sectors that exhibit these qualities are, in general, those businesses that provide basic goods and services to a population that is still releasing over 70 years of pent-up demand. In particular, target industries will be those such as advertising & publishing, construction materials, consumer & household products, consumer services, financial services and leasing, IT services, logistics, media & media services, pharmaceuticals, real estate, retail and telecommunications.Russia Partners often works with industry partners and strategic investors, many of whom are looking to enter the Russian market together with a private equity firm with years of on-the-ground experience. Russia Partners has successfully partnered with, or sold a stake to, strategic investors in several of its portfolio companies, such as Syktyvkar Forest Enterprises, Sidanco, MTV Russia and EuroCement. The combined value of the investments of the foreign strategic investors in these four deals is over $900 million.
