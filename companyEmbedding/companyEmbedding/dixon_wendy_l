 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Eleven Biotherapeutics, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company

      discovering and developing protein therapeutics to treat diseases of the

      eye, today announced the appointment of industry veteran Wendy L. Dixon,

      PhD, former Chief Marketing Officer and President of Global Marketing

      "Wendy brings a blend of biopharmaceutical, commercial and R&D

      leadership experience to Eleven, including executive positions at

      Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck and Co., where she led teams that

      developed, commercialized and launched many successful global

      pharmaceutical products," said Abbie Celniker, PhD, President and Chief

      Executive Officer of Eleven Biotherapeutics. "Wendy's extensive

      experience will be invaluable to Eleven as we continue to look to

      expand, develop and commercialize our ophthalmic pipeline, including our

      lead product candidate, EBI-005, which is in Phase 3 clinical

      development for dry eye disease and Phase 2 clinical development for

      allergic conjunctivitis."

    


      "I see significant potential in Eleven's pipeline of ophthalmic drug

      candidates which were derived from its proprietary AMP-Rx™ protein

      engineering platform to treat a range of ocular diseases including dry

      eye disease, allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis and diabetic macular

      edema," said Dr. Dixon. "I am pleased to play a role in establishing

      Eleven as a leader in the development of novel protein therapeutics for

      ocular disease."

    

Dr. Dixon brings 35 years of industry experience to the Eleven

      Biotherapeutics Board of Directors. Most recently, she was a senior

      firm, from 2010 to 2012. From 2001 to 2009, Dr. Dixon had a series of

      commercial and development roles within Bristol-Myers Squibb,

      Marketing, and was a member of the CEO's Executive Committee. Earlier,

      Dr. Dixon served as Senior Vice President of Marketing at Merck and Co.

      and prior to that, she held executive management positions at West

      Pharmaceuticals, Osteotech and Centocor, and various positions at

      SmithKline and French (now GlaxoSmithKline) in marketing, regulatory

      affairs, project management and as a biochemist. Dr. Dixon received her

      BSc, MSc and PhD from the University of Cambridge (UK). Since 2005, Dr.
