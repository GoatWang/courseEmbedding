Analytics
 
Alpha:A measure of the difference between a fund’s actual returns and its expected performance, given its level of risk as measured by beta. A positive alpha figure indicates the fund has performed better than its beta would predict. In contrast, a negative alpha indicates the fund’s underperformance, given the expectations established by the fund’s beta. All MPT statistics (alpha, beta, and R-squared) are based on a least-squares regression of the fund’s return over Treasury bills (called excess return) and the excess returns of the fund’s benchmark index. Alpha can be used to directly measure the value added or subtracted by a fund’s manager. Alpha depends on two factors: 1) the assumption that market risk, as measured by beta, is the only risk measure necessary 2) the strength of the linear relationship between the fund and the index, as it has been measured by R-squared. In addition, a negative alpha can sometimes result from the expenses that are present in a fund’s returns, but not in the returns of the comparison index. Example: A fund has an alpha of 0.86, a beta of 0.96 and an R-squared of 97. The high R-squared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the fund’s alpha and beta. The alpha of 0.86 indicates that the fund produced a return 0.86% higher than its beta would predict.
 
Beta:A measure of a fund’s sensitivity to market movements. The beta of the market is 1.00 by definition. Morningstar calculates beta by comparing a fund’s excess return over Treasury bills to the market’s excess return over Treasury bills, so a beta of 1.10 shows that the fund has performed 10% better than its benchmark index in up markets and 10% worse in down markets, assuming all other factors remain constant. Conversely, a beta of 0.85 indicates that the fund’s excess return is expected to perform 15% worse than the market’s excess return during up markets and 15% better during down markets. Beta can be a useful tool when at least some of a fund’s performance history can be explained by the market as a whole. Beta is particularly appropriate when used to measure the risk of a combined portfolio of mutual funds. It is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility. A low beta signifies only that the fund’s market-related risk is low. (Standard deviation is a measure of a fund’s absolute volatility.) A specialty fund that invests primarily in gold, for example, will usually have a low beta, as its performance is tied more closely to the price of gold and gold-mining stocks than to the overall stock market. Thus, the specialty fund might fluctuate wildly because of rapid changes in gold prices, but its beta will remain low. R-squared is a necessary statistic to factor into the equation, because it reflects the percentage of a fund’s movements that are explained by movements in its benchmark index. Example: A fund has an alpha of 0.86, a beta of 0.96, and an R-squared of 97. The high R-squared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the fund’s alpha and beta. The beta of 0.96 indicates the fund’s performance is very close to that of the market, which would be represented by 1.00.
 
Compounded Annual Return:The compound return is the rate of return, usually expressed as a percentage, that represents the cumulative effect that a series of gains or losses have on an original amount of capital over a period of time. Compound returns are usually expressed in annual terms, meaning that the percentage number that is reported represents the annualized rate at which capital has compounded over time.
 
Correlation Coefficient:The correlation coefficient is a measure that determines the degree to which two variables’ movements are associated. The range of values for the correlation coefficient is -1.0 to 1.0. If a calculated correlation is greater than 1.0 or less than -1.0, a mistake has been made. A correlation of -1.0 indicates a perfect negative correlation, while a correlation of 1.0 indicates a perfect positive correlation.
 
Cumulative Return:The aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time, independent of the period of time involved. Presented as a percentage, the cumulative return is the raw mathematical return of the following calculation:
 
Downside Deviation:Downside deviation is a measure of downside risk that focuses on returns that fall below a minimum threshold or minimum acceptable return (MAR). It is used in the calculation of a risk measure known as the Sortino Ratio.Standard deviation, the most widely used measure of investment risk, has some limitations, such as the fact that it treats all deviations from the average – whether positive or negative – as the same. However, investors are generally more concerned with negative divergences than positive ones, i.e. downside risk is a bigger concern. Downside deviation resolves this issue by focusing only on downside risk.Another advantage over standard deviation is that downside deviation can also be tailored to the specific objectives and risk profile of different investors who have various levels of minimum acceptable return.
 
Maximum Drawdown:A maximum drawdown (MDD) is the maximum loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. Maximum Drawdown (MDD) is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period. It can be used both as a stand-alone measure or as an input into other metrics such as “Return over Maximum Drawdown” and Calmar Ratio.
 
R-squared:R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. For fixed-income securities, the benchmark is the T-bill. For equities, the benchmark is the S&P 500.
 
Sharpe Ratio:The Sharpe Ratio is a measure for calculating risk-adjusted return, and this ratio has become the industry standard for such calculations. It was developed by Nobel laureate William F. Sharpe. The Sharpe ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Subtracting the risk-free rate from the mean return, the performance associated with risk-taking activities can be isolated. One intuition of this calculation is that a portfolio engaging in “zero risk” investment, such as the purchase of U.S. Treasury bills (for which the expected return is the risk-free rate), has a Sharpe ratio of exactly zero. Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.
 
Sortino Ratio:A modification of the Sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from general volatility by taking into account the standard deviation of negative asset returns, called downside deviation. The Sortino ratio subtracts the risk-free rate of return from the portfolio’s return, and then divides that by the downside deviation. A large Sortino ratio indicates there is a low probability of a large loss.
 
Standard Deviation:Standard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean. The more spread apart the data, the higher the deviation. Standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variance.In finance, standard deviation is applied to the annual rate of return of an investment to measure the investment’s volatility. Standard deviation is also known as historical volatility and is used by investors as a gauge for the amount of expected volatility.Standard deviation is a statistical measurement that sheds light on historical volatility. For example, a volatile stock will have a high standard deviation while the deviation of a stable blue chip stock will be lower. A large dispersion tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returns.Sources: Morningstar, Investopedia

How to Interpret Fed-speak
  Jun 9, 2017  Everyone knows the Fed is data dependent, it’s a famous phrase used in all of their statements. “The actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data,” as the Fed put it in their latest release1. But what should investors exactly look at when deciphering the Fed?

Tech Trend: How to Play Cybersecurity
  Dec 23, 2016  The internet has been growing at an incredible clip…but so has cybersecurity threats. The internet of things, mobile applications and other connected mediums have woven their way into our daily work lives and at-home routines.

Monetary Policy World Tour
  Oct 19, 2016  Alpha can be found in any corner of the globe, but before capital can be put to work, the fundamentals must be taken into consideration. Nowadays, one of the biggest drivers of returns is central banks. Accordingly, below is what you need to know for each major central bank, from where they stand to what expectations are being priced in, as well as the effectiveness of their current policy as measured by economic activity and inflation.

Edge in Selling Options Part 2: The Put-Write
  Sep 8, 2016  $100 invested in the CBOE S&P 500 Put-Write Index strategy in 1986 would be worth just about $1,700 today, clocking in at 10.1% annual returns.
A CBOE study recently concluded that despite the perceived risk of shorting puts, the strategy has performed incredibly well, even during the 2008 crash. Specifically, the study tested selling at the money puts on the SPX one month out and investing the secured cash in three month treasury bills.

  Jun 22, 2016  Alphabet’s moonshot factory, X, is trying to solve huge problems with breakthrough technologies and seemingly radical solutions to make the world a better place.

Japan’s J Curve
  May 19, 2016  Japan’s most recent affair with quantitative easing began in October of 2010 following poor economic and inflation growth after the great recession. Since then, Japan’s headline stock index, the Nikkei 225, has rallied nearly 70%; however, Japan’s quantitative easing program has far outpaced stock market growth.

Buybacks Boost Silicon Valley
  Apr 26, 2016  The Bay Area knows its way around an expansion cycle. Few have experienced equity volatility like Silicon Valley, for both public and private entities. Low interest rates and a general appetite for risk has seemingly pushed tech multiples to the moon, but this underlying trend has bolstered The Valley more than many give it credit.

What Actually Drives the Price of Oil
  Mar 30, 2016  Commodities are often associated with purely speculative investments. This is simply not the case. Just like a stock, commodities have fundamental drivers too.
The price of oil has become increasingly more important since it began to tumble back in June of 2014. When the market started to trend with oil, interest in black gold surged even more. With renewed interest in oil, it’s essential to look at what the professionals consider when analyzing a trade.

How the ECB is Actually Hurting Banks
  Feb 19, 2016  European bank stocks have been getting slammed. Concealed by Chinese Yuan and Federal Reserve headlines, European financials have secretly been having a terrible year.  Poster child European banks like Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse are down nearly 30% and 40% respectively in the last six months—

Myth: America Will End Up Like Japan
  Feb 11, 2016  “Whatever it takes” is an aggressive mandate for monetary policy—nothing short of historic. Momentous action is called for, however, in the case of Japan. The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is attempting to rescue the country from its decade long economic slump. Accordingly, Japanese central bankers have passed some of the most aggressive policy measures ever seen.  Despite these actions, Japan is still plagued with subpar inflation growth and is far from its consumer price index goal.

Edge in Selling Options Part I: The Buy-Write
  Jan 28, 2016  Alpha can be elusive. Many investors spend their careers chasing fads and attempting ill-fated trades to hopefully boost their performance. Finding these opportunities, historically, required a research team and other scarce trading resources. Now more than ever, these capabilities are freely available to investors through technology. Interest in extracting alpha via options has brought forth the rapid adoption of options as a risk management and return enhancement tool.

So the Fed Raised Rates…Now What?
  Jan 16, 2016  Janet Yellen is in a tight spot. Domestic economic indicators seem to be strong compared to the rest of the world, but a backdrop of diverging international economies seem to have gotten the better half of other central banks.
Despite these concerns, the Fed stuck to its plan of raising interest rates in December to 0.25%, kicking off a new interest rate regime. Going forward, investors will need to look at the 2016 calendar for clues as to when the Fed will raise again.

What to Expect In the Final Quarter This Year
  Oct 26, 2015  We’re finally coming to a close for 2015, and the final quarter will be the conclusion to a year that’s been defined by uncertainty and uneven performances. Mixed economic data haven’t given investors a clear vision of what the future will look like, while other regions around the world have shared in a global economic slowdown that finally culminated in a collapse in the Chinese stock market last quarter.

What We Need To Happen For The Fed To Raise Rates
  Oct 7, 2015  It’s been roughly one year since the Fed ended its historic quantitative easing program and gave control of the economy back over to the free market. With those memories of a Fed driven market still fresh in investors’ minds, it seems that the Fed is once again in control of this market’s destiny. Markets are quickly retreating to a “wait and see” trading mentality when it comes to Yellen, which is contributing to a rise in uncertainty and volatility in the broader averages…

Understanding The Difference Between A Correction And The Start Of A Recession
  Sep 10, 2015  Wall Street has been behaving erratically over the past few weeks ever since the Chinese contagion finally reached U.S. shores. As of the close on September 8, 2015, the S&P 500 has shed nearly 110 points, a 5.29% loss, in the past month even after recovering from a drop of nearly 230 points earlier. Meanwhile volatility has soared more than 85% over the same time frame and is currently holding steady around 25…

The Stealth Bear Market That Could Take Markets By Surprise
  Aug 29, 2015  Investors have been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride the past several days as the markets dipped down and back up by hundreds of points. Volatility rocketed up with the VIX ending Thursday the 20th at 19.14 and reaching a staggering high of 53.29 intraday on Monday the 24th – an increase of more than 178% in less than two trading days…

Great Expectations And Truth In Earnings
  Aug 12, 2015  The broader indices continue to tread water at or near all-time highs despite unconvincing mixed economic data and crises in both Europe and China. While the Greek debt issue seems to have come back under control, the collapse in the Chinese stock market has yet to bleed over into domestic markets. Yet the threat of a possible loss has not seemed to faze stocks…
