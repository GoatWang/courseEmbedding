The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Compare SQL Server schema changes from dev, to test, to production
Compare SQL Server database schemas, large and small, with advanced filtering of database objects.
You can explore what’s changed in each database object, down to individual lines of SQL. When you’re ready to deploy, you can create an error-free deployment script in minutes.
Troubleshoot database differences and create reports in HTML or Excel.











Deploy with zero errors
SQL Compare scripts dependencies in your database in the right order, to make sure deployment is successful.
You get notifications about any issues, such as data loss, before you deploy.











Deploy changes directly
Migrate individual schema differences, a selection of them, or all of them.
Build sophisticated rules to selectively limit what to deploy.
You can automate deployments with the command line, run them from the UI, or save a deployment script and run it yourself.











Find and fix problems in production
To fix errors in your production database, compare it to a backup, scripts in source control, or a database snapshot. You can deploy single objects to fix the issue fast.
If you need to fix static data, use SQL Data Compare to deploy changes without the need for full database recovery.

















Introduction to SQL Compare
SQL Compare is the industry standard for comparing and deploying SQL Server database schemas quickly and accurately.
71% of the Fortune 100 use SQL Compare to compare SQL Server databases – because it's relentlessly tested, easy to use, creates flawless deployment scripts, and saves time.
Whether you need to deploy changes or explore the differences between two SQL Server databases, SQL Compare helps you do the job quickly, simply, and with zero errors.

“I bless the day we bought SQL Compare - it saves me time so often. Must have paid for itself a hundred times over.”“SQL Data Compare and SQL Compare are two of the most important tools I have in my development operation. I can be so responsive to end-user requests for new features using the tools to deploy upgrades to my SaaS application (which by the way has 100% uptime for the last 7 consecutive months) because of the excellent work by Redgate.”“100% like the new look and feel. The product is very easy to use and somehow you managed to incorporate a lot of familiarity with the updated look which I think is spot on. Not enough to cause data professionals to go into a panic but enough for us to be wowed.”“For the price you pay, you'll save the equivalent time on your next version release.”“We can create SQL deployment scripts extremely fast and have them ready for a release within minutes of the build being generated. We use SQL Data Compare to sync any system configuration changes, and then we are pretty much ready to go.Your software is, in a word, awesome. Keep up the great work!”“SQL Compare has saved us an awful lot of time and code and allowed us to get our version control organised across our 40 data warehouses... Like I said, great product, great value.”“Just purchased SQL Compare. With the productivity I'll get out of this tool, it's like buying time.”

How the SQL Toolbelt helps you work with SQL Server












Save time with reliable change scripts 
Compare and sync databases with SQL Compare Pro and SQL Data Compare Pro. Set up comparisons in seconds and specify the changes you want to deploy.
In minutes, you’ll have an accurate script to make your changes.












View a full history of changes, including who changed what, when, and why
Explore changes made by your colleagues with SQL Compare Pro, and get alerts about unexpected schema changes with DLM Dashboard.
Share changes with the rest of your team using SQL Source Control. View a full history of changes, including who changed what, when, and why.
You can even deploy directly from your repository so you know you’re deploying the most up to date version.












Automation for fast, repeatable deployments
Cut the time you spend on manual deployment tasks with DLM Automation, which plugs into tools such as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Octopus Deploy.
Include your database in automated processes like continuous integration, alongside your application, and set up a reliable, repeatable deployment process for fast, frequent database updates.














Write SQL up to 52.7% faster
Code fast, with SQL Prompt's SQL snippets and auto-completion, and lay out SQL in your favorite style.
Get suggestions for keywords, objects, and JOIN conditions, and with one click, make code readable and keep your team working to a single coding standard.












Version control your database changes
SQL Source Control gives you a full record of database changes. It connects to your version control system and works inside SQL Server Management Studio, so you can access version control in a couple of clicks as you work.
When you want to deploy with SQL Compare, or run builds with DLM Automation, use your repo as the single source of truth for changes.












Explore, document, and query your database
Search all your tables, views, stored procedures, functions, views, and jobs, with SQL Search. Jump straight to found objects in the Object Explorer.
Document all your objects automatically, with SQL Doc. Use your favorite format: HTML, CHM, or Word. If you’re doing CI, you can document each build as part of the process.
Fetch data or deploy changes to 100s of databases at the same time, with SQL Multi Script.
See the impact of your changes and catch orphaned objects with SQL Dependency Tracker.














Speed up development with continuous integration
Use DLM Automation to build and test your database as part of continuous integration. It checks the structure of your database and confirms your changes can be deployed. At the end, you get a tested NuGet package ready to use for release across all your environments.












Automation for fast, repeatable deployments
Cut the time you spend on manual deployment tasks with DLM Automation, which plugs into tools such as Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Octopus Deploy.
Include your database in automated processes like continuous integration, alongside your application, and set up a reliable, repeatable deployment process for fast, frequent database updates.












Catch bugs before they hit production
Create realistic test data for load testing and integration tests, with SQL Data Generator. Run T-SQL unit tests in SQL Server Management Studio with SQL Test. Run static analysis tests, unit tests, and integration tests as part of continuous integration with DLM Automation. Share your tests with your team using SQL Source Control. 














Stop problems before they affect your users
SQL Monitor keeps an eye on your SQL Servers 24/7, so you don't have to. If there's a problem, you get an instant alert with information that helps you find and fix the root cause of the issue.
It helps you proactively monitor the performance of your SQL Servers, saving you time, and makes sure you always have the answers to tough performance problems.












Manage all your backups in one place
Run backups across all your SQL Servers from the SQL Backup Pro UI – including compression and encryption. Include checks to make sure your backups can be restored. Protect your data from onsite disaster with secure uploads to the cloud.

“Not only is our development team more productive, we are also seeing substantially faster delivery times and, most importantly, more accuracy.”





“We're now deploying at a much higher frequency than before, and have doubled the deployments to production.”“Redgate's tools are generally considered to be the gold standard.SQL Compare is fast, extremely easy to use – Redgate pays a huge amount of attention to its UIs – full-featured and affordable. I wouldn't bother messing around with anything else.”“We are building a software platform for smarter life in organizations. This software is multitenant with separate databases and we know the challenges we’ll be facing in maintaining those databases in a rapidly developing environment.As a start-up we use extreme consideration on how we spent our scarce resources but for us the SQL Toolbelt Essentials was a necessary purchase; it allows us to do exactly what we need – we would not be without the Redgate software aiding us at every step.”“I'm saving 10-12 hours a week using the SQL Toolbelt. The comparison tools have been ridiculously helpful.”“I am absolutely shocked at how good this product is. They think of everything.I postponed buying this for so long, but I do not regret it. If you make money with SQL Server, and you have a car and do not have the SQL Toolbelt, sell your car and buy this product, you will go further, faster with this.”“I've been a SQL DBA for about as long as there has been SQL. I really appreciate so many things about Redgate... The tools are top notch. I use at least one every single day.The pricing is very reasonable, and – best of all – is the customer support. I get quick answers to all my questions from a knowledgeable and professional staff member. Such a departure from the industry as a whole. I'll be a customer for quite a long time.”“Whenever I show people any Redgate software it's like they just escaped communist Russia and have a new life to live.”“I was able to see how the Redgate support team performs when I was under pressure and they did a great job. We have actually decided to implement your product here instead of using TOAD for SQL.Your product is first rate. The SQL Toolbelt provides tools that database developers as well as DBAs should not live without.Excellent product and a great support team.”

Microsoft SQL Server Overview
Microsoft SQL Server 2012 is a cloud-ready information platform that will help organizations unlock breakthrough insights across the organization and quickly build solutions to extend data across on-premises and public cloud, backed by mission critical confidence.
 
Highlights:

The 9s you need with AlwaysOn
Blazing-fast query performance with ColumnStore Index
Rapid data discovery via Power View and PowerPivot
Credible, consistent data via BI Semantic Model and Data Quality Services
Scale on demand from devices to datacenter to cloud
Write applications once, run anywhere with SQL Server Data Tools

Why SQL Server
Microsoft SQL Server is a comprehensive database server and information platform offering a complete set of enterprise-ready technologies and tools that help people derive the most value from information at the lowest total-cost-of-ownership. Enjoy high levels of performance, availability, and security; employ more productive management and development tools; and deliver pervasive insight with self-service business intelligence (BI).
A complete and integrated platform, Microsoft SQL Server brings it all together to get more value out of existing IT skills and assets, increase the productivity and agility of IT departments, and quickly build flexible, innovative applications.

 
Reasons to Migrate 
Organizations today are under tremendous pressure to implement effective cost-control strategies without sacrificing growth, productivity, functionality, or flexibility. Enterprises that currently support multiple data platforms face issues of inconsistency and higher short-term and long-term licensing and service costs. As a database management solution, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 provides everything an organization needs to lower its total-cost-of-ownership, manage all volumes of data from birth to archival, and provide mission-critical functionality and reliability.
Top benefits of migrating:

Low total-cost-of-ownership.
Full scalability, up and out.
Increased performance and speed.
Reduced IT and storage costs.
Minimized downtime.
Always-On Technologies: always available.
Consolidated, enterprise-class environment.
Interoperability with Microsoft Office.

 
Microsoft SQL Server 2012 offers customers the ability to run, grow and transform their IT to meet the most demanding business needs, and provides many benefits over comparable database products from Oracle, IBM DB2 and MySQL. Both IBM and Oracle only include a limited number of features in their base products and charge hefty prices for the “advanced” features, selling them as costly separate options, while MySQL is missing many key enterprise capabilities altogether.
  By contrast, SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition includes all the advanced features in the base product at no additional cost, significantly lowering the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for enterprise customers.
 
If you would like some help choosing which edition of SQL Server 2012 is right for you, please use the Licensing Tool.
 
SQL Server 2012 Highlights
SQL Server 2012 will provide Mission Critical Confidence with greater uptime, blazing-fast performance and enhanced security features for mission critical workloads; Breakthrough Insight with managed self-service data exploration and stunning interactive data visualizations capabilities; Cloud On Your Own Terms by enabling the creation and extension of solutions across on-premises and public cloud. SQL Server 2012 will be available in three main editions:

 	Safety Quick
Lighting & Fans Corp. Reports
Second Quarter and Six Months Financial
Results
 
Market Maker Receives FINRA Clearance To
Offer Quotes In Company’s Stock
 
Company Raises $2,000,000 in Up Round of
Common Stock.
 
ALPHARETTA, GA – August 17, 2015 –
Safety Quick Lighting & Fans Corp. (“SQL” or the “Company”), a manufacturer and distributor of electronic
fixtures incorporating its patented power plug technology, announced financial results for the three and six month periods ended
June 30, 2015. For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company reported revenue of $2,219,000; a loss from operations of $(2,255,000)
and a net loss attributed to SQL shareholders of $(3,013,000) or $(0.08) per basic share. Included in the Company’s net
loss results was amortization costs of $2,284,000 for its GE trademark license and debt discount.
 
SQL's third party manufacturers received GE's approval in
the fourth quarter of 2014, and SQL began recording revenues under its new business model in the first quarter of 2015.
During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company incurred an operating loss of $(938,000) and a net loss attributed to
SQL shareholders of $(2,286,000) or $(0.07) per basic share, during which the Company did not amortize its GE trademark
license, but did amortize debt discount costs of $579,000 and recorded a $568,000 expense associated with the change in fair
value of embedded derivatives.
 
For the three month period ended June 30, 2105,
the Company reported revenue of approximately $800,000; a loss from operations of approximately $1,187,000 and a net loss of $1,467,000
or $0.04 per basic share. Amortization of the GE trademark license included in the financial results was approximately $609,000.
For the comparable period in 2014, the Company recorded no revenue and incurred an operating loss of approximately $583,000 and
a net loss of approximately $1,695,000 or $0.05 per basic share. The 2014 results included an $847,000 increase in other expenses
associated with the debt discount costs and derivatives expense associated with our financings.
 
During 2014, the Company focused on completing
audits of its third party manufacturing facilities to achieve quality compliance consistent with GE standards and meeting with
prospective retailers in North America to gain acceptance as an approved supplier. The Company also incurred costs associated
with registering the underlying shares of the convertible promissory notes and warrants sold through the private placement transactions.
 
Gross profit (gross revenue less cost of goods
sold) was approximately $272,000 or 12.3% of gross revenue and $93,000 or 11.6% of gross revenue for the six-month and three month
periods, respectively. The current gross profit margins reflect the introductory pricing offered for the initial orders and are
expected to increase.
 
Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)
costs for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased approximately $1,319,000 to approximately $2,527,000. The increase was
primarily due to the non-cash amortization of the GE trademark licensing fee, selling expenses and the costs associated with its
public company status. For the three months ended June 30, 2016 G&A increased $697,000 to $1,280,000, due to same reasons
noted above.
 
Other expenses decreased approximately $847,000
to $282,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2015 from the comparable prior year three month period and decreased approximately
$618,000 to $758,000 in the first six months of 2015 from the comparable prior year period due to a reduction in derivative expense
and registration charges which were partially offset by change in derivative liability charges.
 


 


In late July 2015, FINRA cleared the Company’s
market maker’s request to provide quotations for the Company’s common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board. The Company
is in the process of applying to the OTC QB market place and hopes to have its shares publicly traded late in the third quarter
or fourth quarter of 2015. “Receiving clearance from FINRA was an important development for our company and our existing
and prospective shareholders,” stated John P. Campi, SQL’s president and chief executive officer. Mr. Campi added,
“We believe participation in the publicly traded stock market will significantly increase public awareness of our company
and its potentially disruptive technology.”
 
The Company announced that it had closed on a
private placement of approximately $1,280,000 of its common stock at $0.60 per share prior to the end of the second quarter. 
Among the participants in this tranche of the private placement were the Company’s CEO, a member of its board of directors
and other insiders.  The Company closed on an additional $730,000 after the end of the second quarter, for a total raise
of $2,010,000.  The purchase price of the current private placement represents a 140% increase over the conversion price
($0.25 per share) of the Company’s private placement of secured convertible promissory notes sold in the previous year.
 
During the second quarter of 2015, the Company
continued to ship against existing orders while expanding its marketing efforts of GE branded fans to other large retailers. To
further expand its market reach, the Company recognized the exceptional growth of online sales and will be offering an expanded
selection of its products over the Internet. In preparation for this
new distribution channel, SQL stocked approximately $400,000 of product to accommodate initial orders, which commenced in the
current quarter. The Internet distribution strategy is not only expected to increase sales growth, but also serve as an indicator
of popular items for future in-store distribution. “Early indications of our third quarter on-line sales activity show broad
based acceptance of our product quality and offering. This is significant since on-line sales activity has proven to be the gateway
into additional shelf space in the stores,” commented Mr. Campi.
 
For the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company used
approximately $1,920,000 to fund operations compared to $913,000 for the same period in the prior year. Capital was primarily
used to fund operations, accounts receivables and inventory acquired for the e-commerce sales. The Company funded all sales
and cost of sales from existing operations and had $920,000 in cash and cash equivalents on June 30, 2015 and, as previously
mentioned, the Company received approximately $730,000 subsequent to the second quarter end from the private placement of
common stock. As of June 30, 2015 the Company had 39,851,918 shares outstanding, compared with 35,750,000 shares issued and
outstanding at 2014.
 
“The prospects for introducing safer ceiling
and wall mounted electrical fixtures that reduce the risk of shock and injury are very significant. Feedback from prospective
customers and industry regulators indicate that SQL’s patented power plug technology could prove to be a disruptive force
in the industry. We have laid the groundwork and infrastructure that will support the level of growth I believe our technology
and products will attract. We are looking forward to continuing the progress of rolling-out our powerful technology,” concluded
Mr. Campi.
  
About Safety Quick Lighting & Fans Corp.
 
Safety Quick Light (“SQL”)
is a patented, disruptive technology that is transforming the lighting and ceiling fan industry. SQL’s technology replaces
the mounting bar unit built in existing electrical mounting boxes, converting it into a weight bearing plug that has no exposed
wires. Using SQL’s power plug, anyone can safely install ceiling and wall lights and ceiling fans in minutes. SQL’s
technology is UL and CUL listed. Installing a ceiling light fixture is as simple as pushing the fixture in place and pressing
a button.
 
SQL’s technology is comprised
of two parts: a female receptacle that is secured to existing electrical boxes, into which electrical and ground wires are simply
inserted and locked into holes on the device, and a male plug that is preinstalled on the lighting or fan fixture. Once the female
piece is attached to the electrical box, any lighting or fan fixture into which the male plug is incorporated can be installed
in literally seconds. SQL’s technology will be pre-installed in all types of lighting fixtures, including holiday themed
lighting, and ceiling fans, for both indoor and outdoor use. For more information and to view a product video visit www.safetyquicklight.com.

* The Standard edition can only profile methods with source code (i.e. it will not profile Microsoft framework methods or third-party components). It uses PDB files to find out if you have the source code, so you will need the PDB files to see your performance data.





What our customers are saying



“Over the weekend, we rolled out a few speed improvements to the Stack Overflow engine.
First, we did a quick pass with ANTS Profiler and identified a few places where redundant or unnecessary database queries slipped into our code. We like to do this every few months on common pages as a sanity check.”





“I don't know how I ever developed enterprise software without the ANTS profilers.
They have saved me weeks of effort and paid for themselves many times over.”





“It's one thing to write software that compiles and "works". It's an entire other ball game to write software that performs and scales. ANTS Profiler can help you achieve that goal in a very big way.
Redgate's ANTS Performance Profiler is easy to learn to use and the features are both robust and intuitive. I can confidently recommend this product to any professional developer who is interested is producing high-performance, scalable applications.”





“I have had a performance issue for a few days now and tried to pinpoint the cause using my brain and simple debugging tools. I made the purchase for ANTS and within 30 minutes had the issue identified and fixed!”





“Having been an ANTS Profiler user since the early versions of the product this current release makes my favorite toolset even more powerful.
The new SQL features that are parts of ANTS Performance Profiler 9 make diagnosing and tuning SQL performance within .NET applications a breeze!”

Failure to launch: Code, Upload, and Explode
by Microsoft MVP Jeremiah Peschka
Before you load your valuable ASP.NET application into a rocket and aim for the cloud, let's do a sanity check. How do you handle bandwidth shortages that never let your app reach orbit? What happens if you need more speed to haul all these users up? If your uptime flames out, how can you easily plan for splashdown?
Moving an ASP.NET application to the cloud may not be as difficult as putting someone on the moon, but there are a lot of places where something can go wrong. In this session you'll learn how to handle the limitations of a purely virtual environment, measure performance and identify bottlenecks, and deal with the changing availability of resources
