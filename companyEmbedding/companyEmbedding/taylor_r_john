                                Taylor Supports Legislation to Ban Harmful Chemicals in Toys, Children's Products
                            





                                5/8/2008
                            


Rep. John Taylor (R-Philadelphia) is preparing to co-sponsor legislation to regulate toxic chemicals in products designed and marketed to children. 
 
“In recent months, we have heard several cases where toys, baby bottles and other consumer products have been found to contain lead paint and other toxic substances,” said Taylor. “Our laws should protect these innocent victims by banning their sale and use in the Commonwealth.”
 
Taylor’s action follows numerous discoveries of lead paint and other toxic substances in toys manufactured in China, Taiwan and other countries under contract with American companies. Companies such as Mattel, Toys R Us and many others have had to undergo recalls for tainted products, and new discoveries continue to surface.  
 
“Across the country, state legislatures are stepping up to fill the void left by the inaction at the federal level,” said Taylor. “To date, 29 state legislatures have introduced proposals to address toxins in children’s toys and products.”
 
The state of Washington recently passed a comprehensive law regulating the use of toxins as it relates to children’s toys and products.   California has banned phthalates, a toxic substance added to plastics to increase its flexibility that has been linked with birth defects as well as defects in the liver and genitals. Phthalates is also banned in Argentina, Japan, Mexico and the European Union.
 
“It is time for Pennsylvania to act,” said Taylor.  “I support a plan to introduce legislation that will ban the sale, manufacture or distribution of children’s toys and products in the Commonwealth that contain certain chemical components that are known to be harmful to children. This is an important health and safety measure and I want to put manufacturers of these products on notice that the safety of Pennsylvania children is not negotiable.”
 
The Consumer Product Safety Commission has a listing of recalled consumer products, including toys and children’s products, on its Web site at: http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prerel.html

Recommended inflation is 2 psi. * The most accurate way to selectthe right fender for your boat is to survey your docking area to find outwhat fender is in use for the same size and weight of boat, in terms offender dimensions and quantities, and use that as a guideline.See warrantypage for full terms of warranties.

Guaranteed for the Life of Your Boat Against Splitting or Bursting!

John Taylor of Caroline (paperback version)
Click here to enjoy a FREE chapter from Mike Church’s John Taylor  – American Statesman Book.
Why assemble a biography of an obscure, 18th century Virginian who never earned the title “founding father”?  Chiefly because there has not been an attempt to paint a lifelong picture of our subject, predominantly using his own, short form works. Even if this  task were successfully undertaken there remains another reason John Taylor doesn’t appear on Liz Cheney’s radar. He has a reputation of being very difficult to read. John Randolph of Roanoke is said to have quipped. “Taylor’s writing is profound, now if we can just translate it into English.” The purpose of this collection is to demolish that argument. One tool to use in this quest is to read Taylor’s work as satire aimed at the principal target of his work: Federalists. Taylor spent a career proving the anti-federalists of the 1780’s correct and the nationalists wrong, sometimes hilariously. Now, in John Taylor – American Statesman all Americans can learn and be entertained by the works of this gifted leader of the republican school of political thought.
Praise for “John Taylor – American Statesman”: 
With this new edition of selected John Taylor works, some never republished before, Mike Church does the signal service of reminding us of the foremost Jeffersonian publicist–and one of the Early Republic’s most principled politicians.
–Kevin Gutzman, Author, James Madison & The Making of America
“Mike Church has resurrected the ghosts of secession past by bringing to light both the great John Taylor of Caroline and the Northerners who insisted the sections should part ways…in 1794!  Taylor was the greatest political thinker of the early republic and a needed counterweight to the modern nationalist centralization hysteria of both mainstream political parties.  Every politically active American should know John Taylor.”
–Brion McClanahan, Author, The Founding Fathers Guide to the Constitution
John Taylor of Caroline County-American Statesman is NOT a history book, it is an exciting biography & collection of works from the “brains of the operation” behind the political dynasty of the Jeffersonian [r]epublicans, John Taylor.
This collection combines historically accurate biographies of John Taylor of Caroline with Taylor’s own, little known, rare and  previously unpublished works. From arguing against Congress’s taxing power to a satire on Big Government under the Constitution, John Taylor-American Statesman introduces new audiences to one of the great minds of the American Revolution.
In John Taylor you’ll learn…
Most people think the Louisiana Purchase was unconstitutional. Thanks to Taylor’s Senate speech defending the treaty on Constitutional grounds, that urban legend can be dispelled.
Taylor was the first to argue against Congress’s new, “constitutional” taxing power before the Supreme Court in the “Argument against the Carriage Tax.”
Taylor rejected his lifelong friend, James Monroe’s friendship once Monroe was elected President so he could “remain in the opposition” and much more.
If you are interested in John Taylor of Caroline, then check out our American Statesman Trilogy Set!

The Mental Corpus
How Language is Represented in the Mind
John R. Taylor


 Prominent author, well-known for clear writing 
 Profound contribution to linguistic theory and behaviour 
 Will appeal across the cognitive sciences 
 Links to successful OUP books by Ray Jackendoff and Adele Goldberg 








The Mental Corpus
How Language is Represented in the Mind
John R. Taylor



Description



This book presents a radical reconceptualization of the nature of linguistic knowledge. John Taylor challenges the conventional notion that a language can be understood in terms of the interaction of syntax with a lexicon, the second listing the words and the first the rules for combining them. He proposes instead that an individual's knowledge of a language can be thought of as a repository of memories of linguistic experience. Each encounter with the language, he argues, leaves a trace in our minds. We record the forms of utterances, the concepts and interpretations associated with them, and the contexts in which they were heard or seen. Features of incoming language - a word, a phrase, a meaning, a voice quality, an interactional situation - resonate with items already stored. Similarities between stored items give rise to generalizations of varying degrees of certainty and precision, which in turn are able to sanction new and innovative expressions.John Taylor writes with conviction, clarity, and wit, illustrating every stage of his argument with arresting examples. His account makes a profound and original contribution to understanding the nature of language and the operations of the mind and brain. His book will appeal in equal measure to linguists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists.

Reviews and Awards


 "A major step towards an empirically grounded cognitive-linguistic theory of language...his book is equally recommendable to students of linguistics, advanced scholars, and even interested laypersons...Taylor>'s book is highly recommended for anyone interested in usage-based theories of language and linguistic knowledge. It offers valuable insights not only to cognitive linguists and corpus linguists, but also to historical linguists and second language teachers."--Linguist List

When Taylor Swift  released her "Shake It Off" single and music video earlier this month, it was it official: The former country singer has made the switch to full-blown pop star!So what do her Nashville contemporaries think about this crossover? Brad Paisley finds it "admirable," he told E! News Thursday at iHeartRadio's release party for his ninth studio album, Moonshine in the Trunk.Taylor "has this vision for who she wants to be going forward," said the "River Bank" singer. He also praised his longtime pal for "say(ing) in a risky way, 'I am going to evolve beyond what you know me for already.'"



VIDEO: Taylor Swift's classic glam looks!






"People are going to have to get used to it cause its not the Taylor Swift obviously that you knew," he said. "Because this is somebody—like, she was talking about how she cut her hair, and she is spending time in different cities more and becoming more of a product—and she is a world famous superstar now. She is just not Nashville's, [and] we just have to kind of get used to that."Brad, 41, isn't worried about Taylor, 24, and her future in pop music. "People are going to love it," he said, referring to her musical transition. "It's going to sell, and it already is [selling]. She has done a great job."



VIDEO: Taylor swift treats fans to hilarious "Shake It Off" outtakes



As far as Taylor calling out her haters (literally!) in her current single? "All of us have the urge to do that, and I respect her for doing that," said Brad. "I have that urge to do that as well, because it gets old just taking it when you're in the public eye.""It gets old to sort of take it, and it's very noble to not say anything, but it's hard," he said. "It becomes a lot of fun to really steam now and again and challenge somebody who hates you. Because in the end, it's all very sort of unreal and not always accurate.""You know the people who hate you," he added. "They don't really hate you with the same amount of fervor as the people who love you."Moonshine in the Trunk was released on Aug. 26 and also features a duet with Carrie Underwood, titled "High Life," as well as a song called "Shattered Glass," which was inspired by none other than Paisley's wife, Kimberly Williams-Paisley of Nashville and Father of the Bride fame,"It applies to any living breathing women," Paisley said. "It's a different kind of love song that its not about beauty and butterflies; it about belief and the wiliness for a man to step aside and let a women achieve her dreams and that's something my wife helped inspire."

A 4-slice box of Taylor brand pork roll.


Pork Roll (regionally known as Taylor Ham)[1][2][3] is a pork-based processed meat originating and commonly available in New Jersey, New York, Delaware and parts of Pennsylvania and Maryland. It was developed in 1856[4] by John Taylor of Trenton, New Jersey, and sold as "Taylor Ham". Other producers entered the market, and subsequent food labeling regulations required Taylor to designate it as a "pork roll" alongside their competitors.

Origin and description[edit]
While a similar item, packed minced ham, may have been produced at the time of the Battle of Trenton,[4] John Taylor is credited with creating his secret recipe for the product in 1856. George Washington Case, a farmer and butcher from nearby Belle Mead, New Jersey, later created his own recipe for pork roll in 1870. Case's was reportedly packaged in corn husks.[4]
Taylor originally called his product "Taylor's Prepared Ham",[5] but was forced to change the name after it failed to meet the new legal definition of "ham" established by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Marketed as both "Taylor's Pork Roll" and "Trenton Pork Roll", it saw competition from products with similar names like "Rolled Pork" and "Trenton style Pork Roll". When their makers were sued by Taylor a 1910 legal case ruled that the words "Pork Roll" could not be trademarked.[5] In North Jersey, residents continue to use the term Taylor Ham, while South Jersey residents generally use the term Pork Roll, with Central Jersey residents using a mix of the two.[1]
In the 1910 lawsuit, it was described as "a food article made of pork, packed in a cylindrical cotton sack or bag in such form that it could be quickly prepared for cooking by slicing without removal from the bag."[5] Some people compare the modern article's taste and/or texture to Treet, bologna sausage, mild salami, or US-style Canadian bacon.
However, while it has flavor/texture components of each of the above, it is not prepared from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the grainy consistency of cooked salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the tangy variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.
Taylor and Trenton are the brand names for pork roll made by Taylor Provisions,[6] of Trenton, New Jersey. Other companies making pork roll include Case Pork Roll Company[7] and Loeffler's Gourmet,[8] as well as Hatfield Quality Meats of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, and Alderfer Premium Meats[9] of Harleysville, Pennsylvania.
Pork Roll is generally sold in 1, 1.5, and 3 lb. unsliced rolls packed in cotton bag, as well as 6 oz. boxes containing 4, 6, or 8 slices. Larger rolls and packages are available for food service customers. It is also sold at delicatessens, diners, lunch stands and food trucks in the region. It has also been a staple in public school cafeterias in New Jersey.[citation needed]
Preparation[edit]

Pork Roll is generally sliced and pan-fried or grilled, but can also be microwaved. It is commonly given one to four cuts along its outer edge to prevent the slices from bubbling up in the middle and cooking unevenly.[10]
It is typically eaten as part of a sandwich, with popular condiments including salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It is also incorporated in many other recipes,[11][12] notably a popular breakfast sandwich known in the region as a "Jersey Breakfast", "Taylor Ham, Egg, and Cheese", or "Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese." In these fried pork roll is joined with a fried egg and American cheese and served on a hard roll or bagel.
Enthusiasm[edit]
Trenton, New Jersey held its Inaugural Pork Roll Festival on May 24, 2014.
The Trenton Thunder minor league baseball team hosted their inaugural "Trenton Thunder World Famous Case's Pork Roll Eating Championship" on September 26, 2015. Joey Chestnut won the contest by eating 32 pork roll sandwiches in 10 minutes.[13]
The Lakewood BlueClaws minor league baseball team holds a Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese Race at the end of the fourth inning of every home game.[14][15]
A song called "Pork Roll Egg and Cheese" appears on the album The Pod by Ween, locals of New Hope, Pennsylvania, referring specifically to a sandwich consisting of pork roll, egg and cheese on a kaiser roll. Several other songs by the band such as "Frank" also contain references to pork roll.
On April 14, 2016, Assemblyman Tim Eustace introduced an Act in the New Jersey State Legislature designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. "An Act designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes."[16]
On May 15, 2016, President Barack Obama's gave a commencement speech at Rutgers University's 250th graduation ceremony. He opened his commencement speech by addressing the "Taylor ham vs. pork roll debate." To quote, "I come here for a simple reason – to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question. (Laughter and applause.) I'm just kidding. (Laughter.) There's not much I'm afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate."[17]

It is typically eaten as part of a sandwich, with popular condiments including salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It is also incorporated in many other recipes,[11][12] notably a popular breakfast sandwich known in the region as a "Jersey Breakfast", "Taylor Ham, Egg, and Cheese", or "Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese." In these fried pork roll is joined with a fried egg and American cheese and served on a hard roll or bagel.
Enthusiasm[edit]
Trenton, New Jersey held its Inaugural Pork Roll Festival on May 24, 2014.
The Trenton Thunder minor league baseball team hosted their inaugural "Trenton Thunder World Famous Case's Pork Roll Eating Championship" on September 26, 2015. Joey Chestnut won the contest by eating 32 pork roll sandwiches in 10 minutes.[13]
The Lakewood BlueClaws minor league baseball team holds a Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese Race at the end of the fourth inning of every home game.[14][15]
A song called "Pork Roll Egg and Cheese" appears on the album The Pod by Ween, locals of New Hope, Pennsylvania, referring specifically to a sandwich consisting of pork roll, egg and cheese on a kaiser roll. Several other songs by the band such as "Frank" also contain references to pork roll.
On April 14, 2016, Assemblyman Tim Eustace introduced an Act in the New Jersey State Legislature designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. "An Act designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes."[16]
On May 15, 2016, President Barack Obama's gave a commencement speech at Rutgers University's 250th graduation ceremony. He opened his commencement speech by addressing the "Taylor ham vs. pork roll debate." To quote, "I come here for a simple reason – to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question. (Laughter and applause.) I'm just kidding. (Laughter.) There's not much I'm afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate."[17]

A 4-slice box of Taylor brand pork roll.


Pork Roll (regionally known as Taylor Ham)[1][2][3] is a pork-based processed meat originating and commonly available in New Jersey, New York, Delaware and parts of Pennsylvania and Maryland. It was developed in 1856[4] by John Taylor of Trenton, New Jersey, and sold as "Taylor Ham". Other producers entered the market, and subsequent food labeling regulations required Taylor to designate it as a "pork roll" alongside their competitors.

Origin and description[edit]
While a similar item, packed minced ham, may have been produced at the time of the Battle of Trenton,[4] John Taylor is credited with creating his secret recipe for the product in 1856. George Washington Case, a farmer and butcher from nearby Belle Mead, New Jersey, later created his own recipe for pork roll in 1870. Case's was reportedly packaged in corn husks.[4]
Taylor originally called his product "Taylor's Prepared Ham",[5] but was forced to change the name after it failed to meet the new legal definition of "ham" established by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. Marketed as both "Taylor's Pork Roll" and "Trenton Pork Roll", it saw competition from products with similar names like "Rolled Pork" and "Trenton style Pork Roll". When their makers were sued by Taylor a 1910 legal case ruled that the words "Pork Roll" could not be trademarked.[5] In North Jersey, residents continue to use the term Taylor Ham, while South Jersey residents generally use the term Pork Roll, with Central Jersey residents using a mix of the two.[1]
In the 1910 lawsuit, it was described as "a food article made of pork, packed in a cylindrical cotton sack or bag in such form that it could be quickly prepared for cooking by slicing without removal from the bag."[5] Some people compare the modern article's taste and/or texture to Treet, bologna sausage, mild salami, or US-style Canadian bacon.
However, while it has flavor/texture components of each of the above, it is not prepared from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the grainy consistency of cooked salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the tangy variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.
Taylor and Trenton are the brand names for pork roll made by Taylor Provisions,[6] of Trenton, New Jersey. Other companies making pork roll include Case Pork Roll Company[7] and Loeffler's Gourmet,[8] as well as Hatfield Quality Meats of Hatfield, Pennsylvania, and Alderfer Premium Meats[9] of Harleysville, Pennsylvania.
Pork Roll is generally sold in 1, 1.5, and 3 lb. unsliced rolls packed in cotton bag, as well as 6 oz. boxes containing 4, 6, or 8 slices. Larger rolls and packages are available for food service customers. It is also sold at delicatessens, diners, lunch stands and food trucks in the region. It has also been a staple in public school cafeterias in New Jersey.[citation needed]

A "Jersey Breakfast" of pork roll, egg, & cheese






A sandwich featuring taylor ham at a delicatessen in New Jersey


Pork Roll is generally sliced and pan-fried or grilled, but can also be microwaved. It is commonly given one to four cuts along its outer edge to prevent the slices from bubbling up in the middle and cooking unevenly.[10]
It is typically eaten as part of a sandwich, with popular condiments including salt, pepper, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, lettuce, and tomato. It is also incorporated in many other recipes,[11][12] notably a popular breakfast sandwich known in the region as a "Jersey Breakfast", "Taylor Ham, Egg, and Cheese", or "Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese." In these fried pork roll is joined with a fried egg and American cheese and served on a hard roll or bagel.
Enthusiasm[edit]
Trenton, New Jersey held its Inaugural Pork Roll Festival on May 24, 2014.
The Trenton Thunder minor league baseball team hosted their inaugural "Trenton Thunder World Famous Case's Pork Roll Eating Championship" on September 26, 2015. Joey Chestnut won the contest by eating 32 pork roll sandwiches in 10 minutes.[13]
The Lakewood BlueClaws minor league baseball team holds a Pork Roll, Egg, and Cheese Race at the end of the fourth inning of every home game.[14][15]
A song called "Pork Roll Egg and Cheese" appears on the album The Pod by Ween, locals of New Hope, Pennsylvania, referring specifically to a sandwich consisting of pork roll, egg and cheese on a kaiser roll. Several other songs by the band such as "Frank" also contain references to pork roll.
On April 14, 2016, Assemblyman Tim Eustace introduced an Act in the New Jersey State Legislature designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes. "An Act designating the Taylor Ham, egg, and cheese sandwich as the New Jersey State Sandwich and supplementing chapter 9A of Title 52 of the Revised Statutes."[16]
On May 15, 2016, President Barack Obama's gave a commencement speech at Rutgers University's 250th graduation ceremony. He opened his commencement speech by addressing the "Taylor ham vs. pork roll debate." To quote, "I come here for a simple reason – to finally settle this pork roll vs. Taylor ham question. (Laughter and applause.) I'm just kidding. (Laughter.) There's not much I'm afraid to take on in my final year of office, but I know better than to get in the middle of that debate."[17]

About Taylor Guitars Taylor Guitars was founded in 1974 by Bob Taylor and Kurt Listug, and has grown into the leading global builder of premium acoustic guitars. Renowned for blending modern, innovative manufacturing techniques with a master craftsman's attention to detail, Taylor acoustic guitars are widely considered among the best-sounding and easiest to play in the world. The company is a pioneer in the use of computer mills, lasers and other high-tech tools and proprietary machinery, and today, Bob Taylor is widely recognized throughout the musical instrument industry as the visionary acoustic guitar manufacturer.
Our site has a wealth of information about what goes into making a Taylor guitar and how to make this very important decision. We have guides for how to find the right fit for you. Learn about the subtle differences in shapes and styles. Delve into different types of woods and construction, which are vital to the flavor and tone of an acoustic. Explore the Taylor line by series to find the look and style you want for your instrument.
Every guitar player needs a great acoustic guitar – or several – in their collection. Finding the right acoustic guitar for you can be a daunting process even for the most seasoned player. If you are new to shopping for guitars, then it is even more critical that you learn all you can before you make your first purchase. If your first acoustic guitar is not the appropriate choice for you, then it can dramatically reduce the enjoyment you will get out of your instrument. If you are a new guitar player, the wrong guitar can be downright discouraging. You want a guitar that fits you, is effortless to play, and has the rich, beautiful tone you love to make it the instrument you dream of playing hour after hour.
A free, guided tour of the Taylor factory is given every Monday through Friday at 1 p.m. (excluding holidays). Groups of 10 or more guests are required to make a reservation to guarantee space on the tour. Please contact us to schedule a tour for your group.
The Taylor Guitars factory tour takes guests through the steps of acoustic guitar construction. From wood selection to final assembly, guests will experience each process as a guitar evolves from raw wood into a finished instrument. You will also have an opportunity to visit the TaylorWare store. Here you will find everything for the Taylor fan, from apparel to gift items to replacement guitar parts. The tour lasts approximately one hour and 15 minutes and departs from the main building at 1980 Gillespie Way in El Cajon, California.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. John Taylor has the following 1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
