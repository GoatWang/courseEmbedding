Featured Project


Bullfrog Gold Project, Nevada
 

The Bullfrog Gold Project is located in the prolific Walker Trend about 120 miles NW of Las Vegas, Nevada and has excellent infrastructure.   Barrick Gold Corp. produced 2.1 million ounces of gold during the 1990’s from the main Bullfrog open pit, the northern one third of which is now controlled by the Company.  The Company's lands also include the entire Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) deposit, from which Barrick produced an additional 220,000 ounces of gold. The M-S area also produced 70,000 ounces averaging 0.47 gold ounce per ton from underground mining operations in the early 1900's. 
In October 2014 the Company executed an option to purchase 12 strategic patented claims located adjacent to the Company’s lands and that include the north-east half of the M-S open pit mine. In March 2015 the Company exercised a lease/option to purchase 6 patented claims, 20 unpatented claims and 8 mill site claims from Barrick Bullfrog Inc. The Company now has a logical land unit and an extensive data base to support its exploration and development programs.

Bullfrog Gold Project – 120 miles NW of Las Vegas, Nevada
The Company’s prospective lands now include the entire Montgomery-Shoshone (M-S) pit and northern third of the Bullfrog deposit, from which Barrick Bullfrog Inc. recovered 220,000 ounces averaging 2.2 g/t from the M-S pit, 1.1 million ounces averaging 2.5 g/t from the northern Bullfrog pit and 690,000 ounces at 7.5 g/t from their underground mine. Barrick terminated mining in late 1998 and milling in early 1999, during which times gold prices averaged less than $290 per ounce.
 
BFGC is the only entity since 1999 to examine the Barrick electronic and paper data bases, which include 157 miles of drilling in 1,298 holes and more than 2,500 pounds of documents. BFGC recently estimated mineral inventories remaining around the Barrick mines at 470,000 ounces averaging 0.89 g/t, based on cross-sectional methods and a nominal cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t. These average and cutoff grades are higher than most heap leach projects proposed and operating in the U.S.A. The estimates are also supported by close-spaced drill holes upon which Barrick recovered a total of 2.3 million ounces from their proven and probable ore reserve estimates. As a result, these estimates could be readily and inexpensively upgraded in compliance with US and Canadian estimation standards. BFGC has also identified significant additional mineralization and defined several exploration targets that could further enhance the project and add shareholder value. Although Barrick’s buildings and equipment have been removed, Project infrastructure and attributes include suitable access roads and pit ramps, main powerline and substation, a paved state highway that crosses the property, more water rights than foreseeably needed and a town less than 4 miles away that hosts a population of 1,000 with associated amenities and services. 
 
Pilot heap leach tests performed by Barrick in 1995 on 844 tons containing 0.59 g/t and crushed to -1.5-inch recovered 67% of the gold in only 41 days of leaching. Cyanide and lime consumptions were less than 0.25 pound/ton and nil, respectively. Finer crushed material yielded gold recoveries up to 75%. In 1986 St Joe column leached a 22-ton composite of minus 12-inch material to simulate leaching large Run-of-Mine (ROM) sizes and remarkably recovered 49% in only 59 days of leaching. This would allow a ROM cutoff grade of 0.2 g/t or less. In this regard, Barrick did not have low cost heap leaching facilities and used cut-off grades of 0.5 g/t for pit ore and 3.0 g/t for underground ore.
 
The Company has a market capitalization per ounce of mineralization of less than $25 compared to $45 to $140 for most companies having similar heap leach projects.  The Company recently reduced its debt from $3.3 million to $0.3 million. 
 
Management
David Beling, President and CEO is a Professional Mining Engineer with 52 years of experience, including engineering, permitting, financing and management of 12 open pit mines, 9 underground mines, 14 process plants and building of several corporations. His career initially included 14 years of employment with Phelps Dodge, Union Oil, Fluor, United Technologies and Westinghouse, then 38 years of project and executive management and senior consulting with 25 junior US and Canadian base and precious metal mining companies. During 2006 and 2007 he spearheaded an IPO, drove three equity raises totaling C$ 112 million and grew the company’s market capitalization to US $460 million. Mr. Beling has served on fourteen Boards since 1981, including three mining companies distinguished by Canada’s TSX Venture Exchange as top-10 performers.
