Passive collection
We may use “cookies” to store and sometimes track information about our online customers and users. A cookie is a small piece of information stored on your computer. Cookies help us improve user experience when individuals visit and use our websites. Most browsers are set to accept cookies, however users can usually change their settings to refuse cookies or to alert that cookies are being sent.
We may use analytics tools (including from third party technologies) to collect non-personal information in the form of various usage and user metrics about online customers and users. These tools collect and analyse certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers, referring and exit URLs, onsite behaviour and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics, usage and purchase history, and other similar information.
We may permit certain third party companies to help us to tailor advertising that we think may be of interest to online customers based on their use of our websites and/or online services and to otherwise collect and use data about their use of our websites and/or online services. This allows us to make special offers and continue to market our products and services to those who have shown interest in our products and services.

Collecting sensitive information
Unless we have consent, we will not collect sensitive information about an individual. Consent means voluntary agreement (express or implied), that is current and specific, by an individual with the capacity to understand and communicate their consent, having been adequately informed of the matter they are agreeing to (eg. act, practice or purpose).
We may collect health information about consumers in the course of our complaints handling processes, or about consultants or contractors working at our premises.
This is subject to some exceptions including if&colon;

the information is health information and it is necessary to provide a health service; and/or
the collection is required or authorised by an Australian law or court/tribunal order; a permitted general situation as defined in the Privacy Act exists.

Consequences of not providing personal information
Failing to provide Mayne Pharma with certain personal information means that, potentially, we may not be able to provide the relevant product or service to the individual concerned or not be able to adequately deal with complaints. It may also affect our ability to properly consider the suitability of a job applicant or labour hire.
Disclosing personal information
In line with modern business practices and to meet individuals' specific needs, we may disclose personal information to the organisations described below.
The relevant organisations include&colon;

contractors to whom we have outsourced some of our functions (eg. product complaints handling and marketing)

organisations involved in maintaining, reviewing and developing our business systems and websites, procedures and infrastructure including testing or upgrading our computer systems
organisations involved in managing, validating or administering an individual’s application, employment or engagement such as third party suppliers, assessment agencies, organisations providing education and training, professional associations and counsellors
organisations involved in the payments system including financial institutions, merchants and payment organisations
our related companies including those located in the USA
an individual's representatives (e.g. their authorised personal representatives or their legal advisers)

Because we operate throughout Australia and overseas, some disclosures may occur outside the Australian state or territory in which an individual is resident including overseas. Overseas recipients to whom we may potentially disclose personal information are located in the USA, Europe, Asia and New Zealand.
Using government identifiers
In certain circumstances we are required to collect government identifiers such as passport numbers. We do not adopt these as our own and we will only use them where it is reasonably necessary to verify the identity of an individual for the purposes of our activities and functions.
Marketing our products and services and opting out
We may use and disclose personal information for the purposes of informing individuals about&colon;

Mayne Pharma products and services that may be of interest and suit their requirements; and
promotions or other opportunities in which they may be interested

When we send direct marketing we will tell individuals how they can stop receiving further direct marketing communications from us.
If you wish to stop receiving direct marketing communications from us by any means or at all please let us know by contacting us on the details below.
Storing personal information
We store personal information in different ways, including hardcopy and electronic form. The security of personal information is important to us and we take reasonable steps to protect it from misuse, interference or loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we do this include&colon;

requiring our staff to be trained in all relevant policies and procedures regarding their rights and responsibilities in maintaining confidentiality
implementing document storage security policies
imposing security measures for access to our computer systems
providing a discrete environment for confidential discussions
only allowing access to personal information where the individual seeking access has satisfied our identification requirements and
ensuring there is access control into our buildings

Personal information that is no longer required for any purpose for which it may be used or disclosed under the Australian Privacy Principles and is not otherwise contained in a Commonwealth record or is required to be retained by an Australian law or court/tribunal order, will be destroyed or permanently de-identified.
Keeping personal information accurate and up to date
We take all reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect is accurate, complete and up to date and also, when we use and disclose it, that it is relevant. We also rely on the accuracy of the information provided to us. We therefore suggest that individuals&colon;

let us know if there are any errors in their personal information; and
keep us up to date with changes to their personal information (e.g. their name and address).

Individuals may do this by mail or email (see our contact details below)
If we are satisfied that the personal information we hold, is inaccurate, incomplete, out of date, irrelevant or misleading or we are asked by an individual to correct their information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure it is corrected.
A request to amend or delete personal information may be refused in certain circumstances. If the request is refused, Mayne Pharma will provide written notification of this decision and our reasons and how the individual may complain, and, if requested, it will be noted with the individual’s personal information that its accuracy has been disputed.
Accessing personal information
Individuals have a right to access their personal information, subject to the exceptions provided by the Privacy Act. Giving access may include allowing an individual to inspect personal information or giving a copy of it to them or showing it to them in some other form.

We may charge a fee for collating and providing access to personal information. Where access is granted, it will be within 14 days of receipt of a request or earlier if appropriate in the circumstances. We will need the individual to verify their identity before we can give access.
If access to some or all of the information is refused, or we cannot give access in the manner requested, then we will take reasonable steps to give access in a way that meeds our needs and the individual's needs which may include the use of a mutually agreed intermediary. However if we refuse access, Mayne Pharma will notify the individual in writing and provide the reasons for this decision and will explain how the individual can complain if they are not satisfied with the decision.

News Detail


Source : Press ReleaseDate : 2009-09-25Companies : Mayne Pharma Group Ltd., Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd., Hospira, Inc.Mayne Pharma Acquisition Announcement 
Friday 25th September 2009, Melbourne Australia: HalcyGen
Pharmaceuticals Limited (ASX: HGN) has entered into a definitive agreement
with Hospira Australia Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Hospira Inc., to
acquire all the outstanding shares in Mayne Pharma International Pty Ltd
(MPI) – one of the businesses Hospira purchased when it acquired Mayne
Pharma Limited in 2007 - for US$15.0M and an "Earnings Sharing
Arrangement".
MPI was formerly known as FH Faulding & Co Ltd, and is a specialist
pharmaceutical company with an intellectual property portfolio built around the
optimisation and delivery of oral dosage form drugs. MPI has a long and
successful history in developing and commercialising improved
pharmaceuticals, and has launched and marketed numerous products
through partnerships with global licensees. Although a wholly owned
subsidiary of Hospira Inc., MPI has operated largely independently of
Hospira’s global hospital products business.
HalcyGen was listed on the ASX in June 2007 following the signing of a global
exclusive license agreement with MPI to access product development and
marketing rights for SUBA-Itraconazole and an improved formulation of
Minocycline. With HalcyGen’s lead product, SUBA-Itraconazole, moving
closer to product registration, the Company has decided to acquire MPI to:
???? acquire the manufacturing rights for SUBA-Itraconazole and associated
financial benefits;
???? acquire SUBA-Itraconazole marketing rights in Australia and New
Zealand; and
???? acquire royalty streams that may have been payable to MPI in the
event that manufacturing was not undertaken at MPI.
Importantly, the acquisition also provides HalcyGen with a significant product
portfolio and pipeline. HalcyGen obtains ownership of several key
pharmaceuticals currently licensed to pharmaceutical partners worldwide, in
particular Doryx (an improved doxycycline enteric coated formulation),
licensed to Warner Chilcott in the USA.
Through MPI’s portfolio of pharmaceutical drug sales, the Company is
expected to show revenues of $63.2M for calendar year 2009 and an EBITDA
of $31.2M for this same period. Following the acquisition, HalcyGen expects
to report sales in excess of $42.2M for the financial year 2010 (being a part
year of 1st Nov 2009 to 30th June 2010).
The "Earnings Sharing Arrangement" allows Hospira to receive a percentage
of gross sales dependent on the achievement of gross sales in excess of
certain target threshold levels by MPI. The "Earn Out" is capped on an annual
basis over a six-year period.
The acquisition includes land (approximately 30 acres) situated in Salisbury,
South Australia; associated buildings, inventory, plant and equipment;
employees, customer contracts and relationships; as well as an intellectual
property portfolio.
The acquisition is largely non-dilutive for HalcyGen, being implemented
through a loan from National Australia Bank (NAB) of US$10.0M to be repaid
within 2 years from profits and further supplemented by a $9.0M two-tranche
placement of shares to be underwritten by Patersons Securities Limited, at
$0.20 per share. The second tranche of the placement will be subject to
shareholder approval.
The Company will also offer existing shareholders the opportunity to
participate in a Share Placement Plan (SPP) at the same price of $0.20 per
share. The record date for the SPP will be 7th October 2009. The SPP will be
subject to shareholder approval and is also to be underwritten by Patersons
Securities Limited to $4.5M.
At the completion of both offerings HalcyGen will have raised at least $11.0M
and will have issued at least 55 million additional shares.
Under the terms of a Transitional Services & Distribution Agreement, Hospira
will continue to distribute a number of MPI products in Australia for a short
period of time.
HalcyGen’s CEO, Dr Roger Aston said, "We are excited by the prospects of
building a diversified portfolio associated with the acquisition of MPI. The
arrangement with Hospira to share revenues allows both companies the
potential to reach their strategic and financial goals in relation to this
transaction. The acquisition of MPI immediately gives HalcyGen global reach
with distribution partners in Australia, USA, Europe and Asia. This deal also
secures our manufacture of SUBA-Itraconazole, which we are confident of
filing for registration in 2010 following recent meetings with EU regulatory
authorities. This acquisition will support our underlying business strategy in
order to create added value and increase long-term shareholder value. The
synergy of the acquisition between MPI and HalcyGen is aided by our
commitment to three key goals: operational integration, synergy in our
products and skill base, and accelerated growth for shareholders.
Terrence C. Kearney, chief operating officer, Hospira, said, "The divestiture of
MPI furthers Hospira’s Project Fuel optimization efforts to rationalize nonstrategic
assets to provide Hospira greater focus on our core Specialty
Injectable Pharmaceuticals (SIP) and Medication Management Systems
(MMS) businesses."
The transaction is due to close in late October. HalcyGen will report further on
the transaction upon completion.

Hospira: David Griss +61 3 8541 5215
HalcyGen Profile:
HalcyGen was founded to bridge the gap between main stream
pharmaceutical companies and high volume generics companies through the
development and licensing of new improved proprietary generic formulations
known as "Super Generics" or "High Functionality Generics". HalcyGen's
strategy is to capitalise on the value associated with the development and
commercialisation of novel, improved variants of existing proprietary
pharmaceuticals known as Super Generics.
The basis of the HalcyGen's strategy is a strategic licensing partnership with
Hospira, Inc. The Company will initially develop and market two products in
partnership with Hospira. Subject to performance and meeting certain other
criteria, the Company has the opportunity to develop further products with
Hospira.
Through the global exclusive license granted to HalcyGen by Hospira, Inc., for
the commercialisation of SUBA-Itraconazole, Hospira has a first right of
refusal to manufacture SUBA-Itraconazole to support sales.
Hospira Profile:
Hospira, Inc. is a global specialty pharmaceutical and medication delivery
company dedicated to Advancing Wellness™. As the world leader in specialty
generic injectable pharmaceuticals, Hospira offers one of the broadest
portfolios of generic acute-care and oncology injectables, as well as
integrated infusion therapy and medication management solutions. Through
its products, Hospira helps improve the safety, cost and productivity of patient
care. The company is headquartered in Lake Forest, Ill., and has
approximately 14,000 employees. Learn more at www.hospira.com.

Elevated Garden Beds
Elevated gardens can truly facilitate an individual’s lifelong passion for gardening all while respecting the physical limitations of the gardener them self. A standing garden or elevated raised garden can significantly increase vegetable or plant yield. By lifting the garden off the ground, the elevated planter acts as a plant protector while also allowing the garden to warm up more quickly extending your gardening season. While DIY raised beds are a popular home project and building your own raised bed is quite rewarding, our high quality selection has the grit and reliability to immediately innovate and improve your vegetable gardening experience today. It includes the reputable and popular VegTrug, the perfect elevated trough for your plant, vegetable or flower gardening needs. 


Our selection elevated garden beds and planters eliminate the need to bend or kneel and make it convenient to plant, tend and harvest plants. Enjoy pain-free gardening by growing vegetables and flowers in these fine and high quality planters.
