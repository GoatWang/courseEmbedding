Early career[edit]
Michael W. Ferro, Jr. was born in 1966 in Merrick, New York and went on to grow up in Illinois. At the age of 15, while attending high school, Ferro started his first company, Earth Wood Care (EWC). Ferro continued to develop and operate the company full-time while attending the University of Illinois Chicago.
Earth Wood Care was acquired by Lisle-based Pettibone in 1992.[11] Ferro joined Pettibone at the time of the transaction, and at the age of 25, became the company’s youngest division president,[12] and devised a plan for the company to place its inventory and price sheets on the Internet so customers could process their own orders, a revolutionary concept for the manufacturing industry at the time.[11]
Click Commerce[edit]
In 1994, Ferro left Pettibone to found Click Commerce,[13] a company that provides business application software and related services.[14] Ferro’s success in his early career made him one of the youngest people named to the Forbes "Tech’s 100 Highest Rollers" list.[15] During this time, Ferro was named Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization,[16] and won the KPMG Illinois High Tech award[17] as well as the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in Technology award.
As the Founder of Click Commerce, Ferro was an early pioneer of enabling business-to-business commerce through the Internet and is often credited as the "Father of the Extranet."[12] Ferro’s design continues to serve as the underlying technology for Internet portals today.
At the age of 33, Ferro took Click Commerce public.[18] With an Initial Public Offering date of June 30, 2000, Click Commerce was one of the first tech companies to reopen the market after the tech crash in March of that year. Gaining 76% on its first day,[19] Click Commerce outperformed the 35% first trading day increase seen by the average IPO that quarter.[20]
In 2006, Click Commerce was the fastest growing company in the supply chain/manufacturing category for companies between $10 million and $100 million, with revenues up 128%.[21] Click Commerce had over 1,400 corporate customers and users in 70 countries, supporting 15 languages.[22] During this time, Click Commerce was named to the "Software 500,"[21] Software Magazine's list of the world's foremost software and services providers, for three consecutive years.[23]
Ferro sold Click Commerce in 2006 for a reported $292 million in cash.[24]
Merrick Ventures[edit]
Ferro went on to found Merrick Ventures LLC, a private equity firm that connects some of the nation’s most powerful investors with Chicago’s budding tech companies.[2] With its debut board of investors from the Crown, Pritzker and Reyes families, among others,[2] Merrick Ventures sought to bring major support to local start-ups during a time when Chicago’s tech entrepreneurs suffered from a lack of venture funding in the Midwest.[2] As the chairman and CEO of Merrick Ventures, Ferro is the founding chairman of Wrapports LLC , which is the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times), higi, LLC, Chicago.com LLC and highschoolcube.com. In February 2016 Merrick Ventures invested $44.4 million in the Chicago-based company Tribune Publishing, which is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune. This makes Ferro and Merrick Ventures the top shareholder of Tribune Publishing with nearly a 17 percent stake in the company.[25]
Technology community[edit]
Named co-chairman of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center alongside Jim O’Connor, Jr in 2005,[26] Ferro led the reinvigoration of Chicago’s tech scene through numerous programs geared toward developing Chicago’s young entrepreneurs. During this time, Ferro served on the Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors under Mayor Richard M. Daley[27] and founded the Merrick Momentum Awards, an annual event to honor the top three-year-old Chicago corporations.[28] Past winners have included GrubHub, EvEd, Sittercity, Salvo software and Cleversafe.
Ferro is Co-Founder of the Illinois Accelerator (I2a) Fund launched in 2007,[29] a Seed/Early Stage Venture Capital Fund designed to partner with the next wave of successful entrepreneurs in the Chicago region. In 2014, Ferro donated $2 million to build an incubator space for student entrepreneurs in a new project called "The Garage" located within Northwestern University.[1]
Philanthropy and affiliations[edit]
Affiliations include: Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute and he holds board positions for the Chicago Community Trust, RAND Health Board of Advisors, Northwestern University, The Economic Club of Chicago, Lurie Children’s Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, The Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, The Lyric Opera of Chicago, Big Shoulders Fund, After School Matters. Ferro is a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, is the Chairman Emeritus of the Young Presidents’ Organization – Chicago and is Chairman Emeritus of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center.
2016 Olympic Bid for Chicago[edit]
In 2006, Ferro was the Chairman of the Sports Advisory Council, a board of corporate citizens named by Mayor Richard M. Daley, to lead the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.[30] Ferro and his wife, Jacky, co-chaired an event that raised 12 million dollars in one night for the Chicago 2016 bid.[31]
Film production[edit]
Ferro made his filmmaking debut in 2014 as Executive Producer of Kartemquin Films’ "Life Itself," a documentary about the life of famed Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert.[32] Ferro produced the film alongside Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian.[33] Ferro’s contribution to the film, directed by legendary documentarian Steve James of Hoop Dreams, amounted to nearly half of the total funds raised from individual donors.[34] Ferro’s support for "Life Itself" came as a charitable gift through his personal non-profit foundation.[34] Ferro also arranged for a private screening of the film for Chicago Sun-Times employees before the film hit theaters on July 4, 2014.[34]

In 2006, Click Commerce was the fastest growing company in the supply chain/manufacturing category for companies between $10 million and $100 million, with revenues up 128%.[21] Click Commerce had over 1,400 corporate customers and users in 70 countries, supporting 15 languages.[22] During this time, Click Commerce was named to the "Software 500,"[21] Software Magazine's list of the world's foremost software and services providers, for three consecutive years.[23]
Ferro sold Click Commerce in 2006 for a reported $292 million in cash.[24]
Merrick Ventures[edit]
Ferro went on to found Merrick Ventures LLC, a private equity firm that connects some of the nation’s most powerful investors with Chicago’s budding tech companies.[2] With its debut board of investors from the Crown, Pritzker and Reyes families, among others,[2] Merrick Ventures sought to bring major support to local start-ups during a time when Chicago’s tech entrepreneurs suffered from a lack of venture funding in the Midwest.[2] As the chairman and CEO of Merrick Ventures, Ferro is the founding chairman of Wrapports LLC , which is the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times), higi, LLC, Chicago.com LLC and highschoolcube.com. In February 2016 Merrick Ventures invested $44.4 million in the Chicago-based company Tribune Publishing, which is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune. This makes Ferro and Merrick Ventures the top shareholder of Tribune Publishing with nearly a 17 percent stake in the company.[25]
Technology community[edit]
Named co-chairman of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center alongside Jim O’Connor, Jr in 2005,[26] Ferro led the reinvigoration of Chicago’s tech scene through numerous programs geared toward developing Chicago’s young entrepreneurs. During this time, Ferro served on the Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors under Mayor Richard M. Daley[27] and founded the Merrick Momentum Awards, an annual event to honor the top three-year-old Chicago corporations.[28] Past winners have included GrubHub, EvEd, Sittercity, Salvo software and Cleversafe.
Ferro is Co-Founder of the Illinois Accelerator (I2a) Fund launched in 2007,[29] a Seed/Early Stage Venture Capital Fund designed to partner with the next wave of successful entrepreneurs in the Chicago region. In 2014, Ferro donated $2 million to build an incubator space for student entrepreneurs in a new project called "The Garage" located within Northwestern University.[1]
Philanthropy and affiliations[edit]
Affiliations include: Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute and he holds board positions for the Chicago Community Trust, RAND Health Board of Advisors, Northwestern University, The Economic Club of Chicago, Lurie Children’s Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, The Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, The Lyric Opera of Chicago, Big Shoulders Fund, After School Matters. Ferro is a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, is the Chairman Emeritus of the Young Presidents’ Organization – Chicago and is Chairman Emeritus of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center.
2016 Olympic Bid for Chicago[edit]
In 2006, Ferro was the Chairman of the Sports Advisory Council, a board of corporate citizens named by Mayor Richard M. Daley, to lead the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.[30] Ferro and his wife, Jacky, co-chaired an event that raised 12 million dollars in one night for the Chicago 2016 bid.[31]
Film production[edit]
Ferro made his filmmaking debut in 2014 as Executive Producer of Kartemquin Films’ "Life Itself," a documentary about the life of famed Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert.[32] Ferro produced the film alongside Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian.[33] Ferro’s contribution to the film, directed by legendary documentarian Steve James of Hoop Dreams, amounted to nearly half of the total funds raised from individual donors.[34] Ferro’s support for "Life Itself" came as a charitable gift through his personal non-profit foundation.[34] Ferro also arranged for a private screening of the film for Chicago Sun-Times employees before the film hit theaters on July 4, 2014.[34]

Early career[edit]
Michael W. Ferro, Jr. was born in 1966 in Merrick, New York and went on to grow up in Illinois. At the age of 15, while attending high school, Ferro started his first company, Earth Wood Care (EWC). Ferro continued to develop and operate the company full-time while attending the University of Illinois Chicago.
Earth Wood Care was acquired by Lisle-based Pettibone in 1992.[11] Ferro joined Pettibone at the time of the transaction, and at the age of 25, became the company’s youngest division president,[12] and devised a plan for the company to place its inventory and price sheets on the Internet so customers could process their own orders, a revolutionary concept for the manufacturing industry at the time.[11]
Click Commerce[edit]
In 1994, Ferro left Pettibone to found Click Commerce,[13] a company that provides business application software and related services.[14] Ferro’s success in his early career made him one of the youngest people named to the Forbes "Tech’s 100 Highest Rollers" list.[15] During this time, Ferro was named Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization,[16] and won the KPMG Illinois High Tech award[17] as well as the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in Technology award.
As the Founder of Click Commerce, Ferro was an early pioneer of enabling business-to-business commerce through the Internet and is often credited as the "Father of the Extranet."[12] Ferro’s design continues to serve as the underlying technology for Internet portals today.

    Michael W. Ferro, Jr. Steps Down As Chairman Of Merge Healthcare
    
    Dennis Brown Appointed new Chairman


    Michael W. Ferro, Jr. Steps Down As Chairman Of Merge Healthcare
Dennis Brown Appointed new Chairman



            Chicago, IL,
            26 Aug 2013

        Merge Healthcare Incorporated (NASDAQ: MRGE), a leading provider of clinical systems and innovations that seek to transform healthcare, today announced that its Board of Directors has accepted the resignation of Michael W. Ferro, Jr. as Chairman and a Director of the Company and appointed Dennis Brown as the Company’s new Chairman, both effective immediately.

“I have decided to step down from my roles as Chairman and a Director of Merge Healthcare,” said Michael W. Ferro, Jr.  “Merge is at the heart of a large, growing and dynamic market for healthcare imaging, and, as its largest shareholder, I have a lot riding on its future success.  I remain very confident in the Company, its products and its new leadership team, and my decision does not reflect any disagreement with Merge’s management or Board.  Rather, I have worked with Justin Dearborn and Nancy Koenig for many years and know that they can and will move the Company forward.  In addition, all Merge stockholders are extremely fortunate to have an experienced and capable leader like Dennis Brown ready to step in as our next Chairman.  I will be available to Justin, Nancy, Dennis and the rest of the Board in the future should they want my input. ”

“Although Merge’s second quarter results were very disappointing, I do not believe that the current trading price of Merge common stock reflects the Company’s inherent strengths, market position or long-term prospects.” Mr. Ferro continued, "While I have no immediate plans in this regard, over time, I intend to explore a variety of ways to increase shareholder value, including, possibly, a going-private transaction.  Of course, overall industry and market conditions, the Company’s business and financial performance and the availability of equity and debt capital and other factors will affect whether a transaction would be advisable.  Accordingly, neither Merge nor I can speculate or provide any assurance as to whether, when, or on what terms such a transaction might occur.” 

Mr. Ferro served as Merge’s Chairman and a Director since June, 2008, when Merrick RIS, LLC made a significant investment in the Company.  Merrick RIS and other affiliates of Mr. Ferro own approximately 26.6 million shares of Merge’s common stock. 

“On behalf of all of Merge’s Directors, I want to thank Michael for his leadership, commitment and vision during his five-year tenure as our Chairman,” said Justin C. Dearborn, Merge’s CEO.  “The entire Merge team will remain focused on the goals and plans that he helped establish, and we look forward to his continued support in the years ahead.”
Mr. Brown, one of Merge’s longest-serving Directors, has been associated with the Company since its initial public offering in 1997.  He brings a wealth of management experience and financial expertise to his new role of Chairman.  Mr. Brown spent 20 years in senior management with the Allen-Bradley Company (now Rockwell Automation) in the US and Europe and 10 years as Vice President of Finance, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of Sybron International Corporation, a global manufacturer of Life Science products.  Mr. Brown currently serves as Chairperson of the Board’s Compensation Committee and as a member of the Board’s Audit and Nominating and Governance Committees.

“I have been involved with Merge for many years now and am a great believer in the Company, its technology platform and its highly-professional management team,” said Mr. Brown.  “As Chairman, I will be making myself fully available to work with the management team to achieve our goals of serving our customers, growing our market position and enhancing shareholder value.”

Ferro, Jr. (born July 24, 1966) is an American inventor, investor and philanthropist. He is best known for founding the Internet software company Click Commerce.[1] He is also the founder and CEO of Merrick Ventures LLC, a Chicago-based private equity firm.[2]An inventor of a number of proprietary products and processes, Ferro holds multiple patents issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.[3][4] Most recently, Ferro was issued a patent for his innovations in medical imaging for MERGE healthcare,[5] and several of Ferro’s developments are currently patent pending.Ferro is active in the Midwest’s budding tech scene, where he focuses on mentoring young entrepreneurs.[6][7][8] Ferro was named to the "100 Most Powerful Chicagoans" list[9] and is a perennial honoree on the "Who’s Who" list by Crain’s Chicago Business.[10]From 2008-2015, Ferro served as the chairman of NASDAQ company Merge Healthcare, turning the organization into a billion-dollar enterprise, which was acquired by IBM in October. From 2011 until early 2016, Ferro served as the Chairman of Wrapports LLC, which owns media properties like the Sun-Times Network, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Chicago Reader, Chicago.com, Aggrego, Thecube.com and Higi LLC.On Thursday, February 4, 2016, it was announced that Ferro became the largest shareholder and non-executive chairman of Tribune Publishing after driving home a $44-million deal via his investment firm Merrick Media. As of June 20, the company has been rebranded as Tronc (standing for Tribune Online Content) and has begun trading on the NASDAQ. As chairman of Tronc, Ferro is determined to usher the historic company into the digital age, focusing on big data and artificial intelligence technology.Ferro currently resides in Chicago, Illinois.Contents1 Early career2 Click Commerce3 Merrick Ventures4 Technology community5 Philanthropy and affiliations6 2016 Olympic Bid for Chicago7 Film production8 ReferencesEarly careerMichael W. Ferro, Jr. was born in 1966 in Merrick, New York and went on to grow up in Illinois. At the age of 15, while attending high school, Ferro started his first company, Earth Wood Care (EWC). Ferro continued to develop and operate the company full-time while attending the University of Illinois Chicago.Earth Wood Care was acquired by Lisle-based Pettibone in 1992.[11] Ferro joined Pettibone at the time of the transaction, and at the age of 25, became the company’s youngest division president,[12] and devised a plan for the company to place its inventory and price sheets on the Internet so customers could process their own orders, a revolutionary concept for the manufacturing industry at the time.[11]Click CommerceIn 1994, Ferro left Pettibone to found Click Commerce,[13] a company that provides business application software and related services.[14] Ferro’s success in his early career made him one of the youngest people named to the Forbes "Tech’s 100 Highest Rollers" list.[15] During this time, Ferro was named Young Entrepreneur of the Year by the Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organization,[16] and won the KPMG Illinois High Tech award[17] as well as the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year in Technology award.As the Founder of Click Commerce, Ferro was an early pioneer of enabling business-to-business commerce through the Internet and is often credited as the "Father of the Extranet."[12] Ferro’s design continues to serve as the underlying technology for Internet portals today.At the age of 33, Ferro took Click Commerce public.[18] With an Initial Public Offering date of June 30, 2000, Click Commerce was one of the first tech companies to reopen the market after the tech crash in March of that year. Gaining 76% on its first day,[19] Click Commerce outperformed the 35% first trading day increase seen by the average IPO that quarter.[20]In 2006, Click Commerce was the fastest growing company in the supply chain/manufacturing category for companies between $10 million and $100 million, with revenues up 128%.[21] Click Commerce had over 1,400 corporate customers and users in 70 countries, supporting 15 languages.[22] During this time, Click Commerce was named to the "Software 500,"[21] Software Magazine's list of the world's foremost software and services providers, for three consecutive years.[23]Ferro sold Click Commerce in 2006 for a reported $292 million in cash.[24]Merrick VenturesFerro went on to found Merrick Ventures LLC, a private equity firm that connects some of the nation’s most powerful investors with Chicago’s budding tech companies.[2] With its debut board of investors from the Crown, Pritzker and Reyes families, among others,[2] Merrick Ventures sought to bring major support to local start-ups during a time when Chicago’s tech entrepreneurs suffered from a lack of venture funding in the Midwest.[2] As the chairman and CEO of Merrick Ventures, Ferro is the founding chairman of Wrapports LLC , which is the parent company of the Chicago Sun-Times), higi, LLC, Chicago.com LLC and highschoolcube.com. In February 2016 Merrick Ventures invested $44.4 million in the Chicago-based company Tribune Publishing, which is the parent company of the Chicago Tribune. This makes Ferro and Merrick Ventures the top shareholder of Tribune Publishing with nearly a 17 percent stake in the company.[25]Technology communityNamed co-chairman of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center alongside Jim O’Connor, Jr in 2005,[26] Ferro led the reinvigoration of Chicago’s tech scene through numerous programs geared toward developing Chicago’s young entrepreneurs. During this time, Ferro served on the Mayor’s Council of Technology Advisors under Mayor Richard M. Daley[27] and founded the Merrick Momentum Awards, an annual event to honor the top three-year-old Chicago corporations.[28] Past winners have included GrubHub, EvEd, Sittercity, Salvo software and Cleversafe.Ferro is Co-Founder of the Illinois Accelerator (I2a) Fund launched in 2007,[29] a Seed/Early Stage Venture Capital Fund designed to partner with the next wave of successful entrepreneurs in the Chicago region. In 2014, Ferro donated $2 million to build an incubator space for student entrepreneurs in a new project called "The Garage" located within Northwestern University.[1]Philanthropy and affiliationsAffiliations include: Henry Crown Fellow of the Aspen Institute and he holds board positions for the Chicago Community Trust, RAND Health Board of Advisors, Northwestern University, The Economic Club of Chicago, Lurie Children’s Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, The Field Museum, Museum of Science and Industry, The Lyric Opera of Chicago, Big Shoulders Fund, After School Matters. Ferro is a member of the Commercial Club of Chicago, is the Chairman Emeritus of the Young Presidents’ Organization – Chicago and is Chairman Emeritus of the Chicagoland Entrepreneurial Center.2016 Olympic Bid for ChicagoIn 2006, Ferro was the Chairman of the Sports Advisory Council, a board of corporate citizens named by Mayor Richard M. Daley, to lead the Chicago bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics.[30] Ferro and his wife, Jacky, co-chaired an event that raised 12 million dollars in one night for the Chicago 2016 bid.[31]Film productionFerro made his filmmaking debut in 2014 as Executive Producer of Kartemquin Films’ "Life Itself," a documentary about the life of famed Sun-Times film critic, Roger Ebert.[32] Ferro produced the film alongside Martin Scorsese and Steven Zaillian.[33] Ferro’s contribution to the film, directed by legendary documentarian Steve James of Hoop Dreams, amounted to nearly half of the total funds raised from individual donors.[34] Ferro’s support for "Life Itself" came as a charitable gift through his personal non-profit foundation.[34] Ferro also arranged for a private screening of the film for Chicago Sun-Times employees before the film hit theaters on July 4, 2014.[34]References^ a b John Pletz (March 18, 2014).
