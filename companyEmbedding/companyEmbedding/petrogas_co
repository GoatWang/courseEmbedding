Products
Inert Bed Support & Topping
Proper packing of the catalyst in the converter and protecting the catalyst bed from external impurities
are essential for obtaining efficiency. Alumina balls, lumps, rings, pellets etc., used as bed toppings
and bed supports act as filters to remove many impurities from the gas stream and help in uniform
distribution of the feed gas. Layers of these materials on top and bottom of the catalyst bed, keep
the bed intact during pressure fluctuations. Hence, it survives depressurization, maintains its integrity
and does not crack, break or shatter under severe environment. The product uniformity is extremely
important for optimization of all aspects of catalyst in a reaction.
Petrogas bed support and topping have excellent product uniformity, which is achieved by careful
selection of raw materials, precise manufacturing techniques and consistent quality control. We
manufacture high, medium and low purity alumina products strictly in accordance with relevant
international standards and as per customer specifications.
Tabular Alumina
Our PGT99 series Tabular Alumina is used in several renowned plants worldwide for high temperature and critical applications since 1981. The high mechanical strength, thermal shock resistance, smooth surface,low porosity,ability to withstand temperature of 1900 deg C plus, long life,etc have prompted most customers to specify this product for trouble free process conditions and to protect their expensive catalysts. 
High Purity Alumina Balls
Petrogas series PG099 products are mostly used in petrochemical and fertilizer industries, petroleum refineries,gas processing and liquefaction industries. 
Fused Alumina
Some speciality chemical plants have applications for this product under our PGFA series that provide inertness, high temperature resistance,acid resistance and process optimization. 
Ceramic Balls
Our PG66, PG67, PG74, PG80 series balls are ideal and standard products used in Oil & Gas Industries and Refineries. Technical Data Sheets pertaining to each categories of the products are available on request. Petrogas have been supplying to almost all leading refineries for more than two decades. Our clients use Petrogas support balls with confidence by specifying our product code for repeat orders to avoid ordering substandard products. Most of the clients know that Ceramic Bals with poor quality will damage the process and the refinery may have to shut down prematurely incurring huge damages. Our products PG74, PG80, etc, withstand all known tests including hydrogen depressurization so that the user could be rest assured of the quality of the support they are using. 
Quartz Pebbles
Tower Packing and fillings require products that are tested over the years. Steel Plants are major clients of this product. PG62 Quartz Pebbles meet all norms required in steel industries and have a long lasting performance. We have developed a new product suitable for blast furnace applications in competitive range with better performance. PG75 exclusive for steel industries.
Porous Balls
We have Engineered   this product for space shuttles launching facilities to adsorb the toxic gases generated in the launch pad and these have been designed and engineered for specific applications too. PG-POR are also used in nuclear facilities.
Alumina Gel
Some of the important uses of Alumina Gel are in the manufacture of Catalysts, Pharmaceuticals, Rubber, Cosmetic and Paper Industries.
Silica Gel
Synthetic Amorphous Silicon Dioxide(SiO2)-Sorbent/Sorbead Silica for industrial use are supplied to meet customer's requirements. It is a hard granular desiccant with the appearance of crushed glass. It is slightly softer than ordinary window glass, odorless, insoluble and nonconductor of electricity. Its action in adsorbing moisture is purely physical and there is no change in size or shape of the particle as it adsorbs vapour. Silica Gel has a very strong affinity for water, which give it an adsorption capacity of over 40% of its own weight at 100%  relative humidity. 
Its major application is moisture adsorption from air/gas streams and from organic liquid such as ethanol, benzene, etc. It is also used for preferential chemical adsorption to remove polar contaminates from non polar solvents-e.g., butanol from butyl chloride. Indicator Silica Gel is used where visual indication is required to show the need for regeneration. Granular and beaded, indicating and non indicating silica gel,etc, are supplied by us exactly to customers specifications. 
Gamma Alumina Catalyst Carriers
Activated Alumina Catalyst Carriers are required to have excellent purity and adequate mechanical strength in order to facilitate proper impregnation of active ingredients. Additionally, a very high adsorptive capacity and high surface area make it suitable for Nox removal and other toxic vapors removal catalysts. Thus, it has substantial use in industrial pollution properties.
High Purity Alumina Carriers in the form of rings, spheres and tablets are used in different catalyst manufacturing processes. Our group produces them suitable for all purposes based on requests.
Ceramic Grinding Media
Petrogas expertise in technical ceramics has been proved in a wide variety of applications and industries including users of ball mills . Ceramic materials are hard, corrosion resistant, chemically inert, non toxic, non magnetic and non porous. These characteristics are well utilised for Mill Linings and Grinding Media for Ball Mills. We produce sintered alumina or Ceramic Linings & Grinding Media for use in many dry and Wet Grinding process.
Activated Alumina
Activated Alumina is a higly porous form of Aluminium Oxide with enhanced surface area. It is used for the adsorption of liquids and gases . One major application of Activated Alumina is as desiccant , either for the removal of bulk quantities of water or for drying of gases containing low concentration of water. The substances that can be treated with Activated Alumina are :Air, Ammonia, Argon,Carbon Dioxide, Furnace Gas, Hydrocarbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Hydrogen Sulphide, Benzene, Gasoline, Lubricating Oil,Naptha, Vegetable oil, Kerosene, etc.
Claus Catalysts
The Clause process is used by the Sulfur Recovery Industry which converts Hydrogen Sulfide into elemental Sulfur and water. The "sour" natural gases have plenty of hydrogen sulfide within and if such gases are burned as fuel, Sulfide escapes, resulting in air pollution and damage to our tender enviornment. It has become an inevitable demand of mankind to convert maximum quantity of Sulfur from "sour"  gas.
Activated Alumina is the most widely used Claus Catalyst which contains a large number of catalytically active surface sites that absorbs Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) and Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) for subsequent reaction to yield elemental Sulfur.
In many acid gas streams, Sulfur is present in various compounds such as H2S, COS, CS2 etc. Some of them may not be present in the feed gas but cumbustion of H2S in the presence of CO2 or hydrocarbons could result the formation of COS/CS2. These compounds must be converted to ensure proper Sulfur conversion. Since the decomposition rate of these compounds are at lower rate than that of H2S/SO2 reaction, a highly active catalyst is required. Sulfation can be  another problem as it reduces surface area and hence the deactivation of catalyst.
Molecular Sieves
PGMS Series Molecular Sieves are highly efficient adsorbents, mainly used to adsorb water, Methanol, Ethanol, Sulfated Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Ethylene, Propylene, LPG etc. It is used as desiccant in industries for deep drying of air, natural gas and refigerant. The product is available in shapes such as sphere , cylindrical pellets, etc. It is Crystalline Aluminosilicate. Mostly used types are 3A, 4A, 5A, 13X, 13X-APG, etc, and we custom produce all these to the cleint's special applications.
Zinc Oxide Desulphurization/Sulfur Catalysts.
These are manufactured for sulphur removal or desulphurization and are availbale in different sizes and specifications. We also have proprietary Catalysts with promoter and binder in extrudate form used for low Temparature Sulfur Adsorption. Petrogas PC907 series catalysts are used by many petrochemical industries.
Chloride Adsorbent, Reformer HCl Guard
Typically used for adsorbing chlorides from reformer hydrogen. It is Scavenger for removing contaminant chlorides from various process streams such as Hydrogen gas, Methane, Ethane, Propane and other various Hydrocarbons both liquid and gases. Our products are used by various LNG/LPG industries, refineries worldwide with repeat orders for the past two decades.
Alkylation, Defluorination   Catalysts
Very high capacity scavenger of Defluorination   of butane, propane and alkalylate streams produced in the HF alkylation process.
Polymer Feed Purification Catalysts
This is used in removal of H2O, CO2, H2S, COS, etc, from propane , propylene, ethylene, isobutene and other organic liquids and gases. Typical application is to use as desiccant, adsorbent, purifier or drying agent.
Arsenic Removal Catalysts
We produce granulated adsorbents and catalysts used in removal of arsine contaminants from ground water, approved for U.N. sponsered pure drinking water supply scheme.
