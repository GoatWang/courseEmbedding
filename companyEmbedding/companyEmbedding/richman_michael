12Richman Greer asserted claims on behalf of the Turnberry Condominium Association against defendants for zoning violations and breach of covenants contained in the Declaration of Condominium involving the former country club’s decision to lease the former club property to the private, for-profit Pritikin wellness center. The lawsuit alleged that the lease between the club and Pritikin, and Pritikin's occupation of the former club facilities, destroyed the private condominium club lifestyle which the condominium residents previously enjoyed and which was guaranteed to them by the condominium documents. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association as to its perpetual right to use the swimming pool facilities adjacent to the condominium building, including the right to patronize the pool cafe. That judgment was affirmed on appeal. While the judgment was on appeal, Turnberry Country Club sold its interests in the subject property to TB Isle Marina/Yacht Club, LP, which entity became responsible for fulfilling the obligations of the former property owner. The Association filed a motion to enforce the prior judgment against TB Isle, alleging that the new owner violated the Declaration and the judgment by failing to comply with its obligations. After a protracted evidentiary hearing, the court ordered that TB Isle forfeited its right to operate the subject swimming pool facilities in accordance with the Declaration and prior judgment, and that those facilities must be conveyed to the Association for it to operate for the benefit of its condominium unit owners and guests.

25Negotiated and drafted severance agreement for executive who voluntarily left her position as editor-in-chief of national publication.


26The firm represents the 5 adult children of the decedent in defense of a $6 million surcharge action. It is alleged that while acting as co-personal representatives, they expended estate funds with creditor - but not court - approval, on multi­million dollar real estate development projects around the country in which the decedent had an ownership interest. Collectively, the decedent personally guaranteed over $140 million in loans used in his development projects. His death triggered a default across the entire loan portfolio and the personal representatives worked with the creditors - the only beneficiaries of the insolvent estate - and developed a business plan with a goal of salvaging the projects to enable them to repay the debt. During the time the workout plan was in place, the creditors continued to demand that their debt be serviced and interest payments made. Due to the fact that the decedent passed away on the cusp of the worst real estate rescission in decades, the efforts of the personal representatives were ultimately not successful in salvaging all of the projects, resulting in many going into foreclosure. Though the efforts of the personal representatives reduced the estate's exposure by over $41 million, the creditors took the positon that despite their agreement to the plan and the expenditures, and despite that the funds were used to the creditors' benefit, because the personal representatives failed to obtain prior court approval to use estate funds, the personal representatives should be ordered to repay to the estate the funds expended in connection with the real estate projects. Following mediation, we were able to negotiate a settlement of all claims and obtain releases in favor of all clients and a discharge from the probate court.

12Richman Greer asserted claims on behalf of the Turnberry Condominium Association against defendants for zoning violations and breach of covenants contained in the Declaration of Condominium involving the former country club’s decision to lease the former club property to the private, for-profit Pritikin wellness center. The lawsuit alleged that the lease between the club and Pritikin, and Pritikin's occupation of the former club facilities, destroyed the private condominium club lifestyle which the condominium residents previously enjoyed and which was guaranteed to them by the condominium documents. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association as to its perpetual right to use the swimming pool facilities adjacent to the condominium building, including the right to patronize the pool cafe. That judgment was affirmed on appeal. While the judgment was on appeal, Turnberry Country Club sold its interests in the subject property to TB Isle Marina/Yacht Club, LP, which entity became responsible for fulfilling the obligations of the former property owner. The Association filed a motion to enforce the prior judgment against TB Isle, alleging that the new owner violated the Declaration and the judgment by failing to comply with its obligations. After a protracted evidentiary hearing, the court ordered that TB Isle forfeited its right to operate the subject swimming pool facilities in accordance with the Declaration and prior judgment, and that those facilities must be conveyed to the Association for it to operate for the benefit of its condominium unit owners and guests. In a subsequent enforcement action brought by Richman Greer on behalf of the Association, the trial court held TB Isle in breach of its obligations under the Final Judgment and Declaration of Condominum and ordered TB Isle to convey to the Association all of the swimming pool facilities.

26The firm represents the 5 adult children of the decedent in defense of a $6 million surcharge action. It is alleged that while acting as co-personal representatives, they expended estate funds with creditor - but not court - approval, on multi­million dollar real estate development projects around the country in which the decedent had an ownership interest. Collectively, the decedent personally guaranteed over $140 million in loans used in his development projects. His death triggered a default across the entire loan portfolio and the personal representatives worked with the creditors - the only beneficiaries of the insolvent estate - and developed a business plan with a goal of salvaging the projects to enable them to repay the debt. During the time the workout plan was in place, the creditors continued to demand that their debt be serviced and interest payments made. Due to the fact that the decedent passed away on the cusp of the worst real estate rescission in decades, the efforts of the personal representatives were ultimately not successful in salvaging all of the projects, resulting in many going into foreclosure. Though the efforts of the personal representatives reduced the estate's exposure by over $41 million, the creditors took the positon that despite their agreement to the plan and the expenditures, and despite that the funds were used to the creditors' benefit, because the personal representatives failed to obtain prior court approval to use estate funds, the personal representatives should be ordered to repay to the estate the funds expended in connection with the real estate projects. Following mediation, we were able to negotiate a settlement of all claims and obtain releases in favor of all clients and a discharge from the probate court.
