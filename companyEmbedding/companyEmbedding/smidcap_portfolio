The Fund
A fundamental approach to investing in small- to midcap stocks, the Fund seeks companies that are in strong financial condition and that management believes are attractively valued relative to earnings and cash flow per share.



The Approach
Fund invests in companies with a demonstrated history of consistent, sustainable earnings growth, strong cash flow and high returns on capital determined by rigorous fundamental analysis of a company's financial trends, products and services, and other f actors.



The Features
By investing in quality small- to midsized stocks management believes to be undervalued, the Fund has historically provided competitive long-term returns with less volatility than those typically associated with small- and midcap investing.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
Global equity markets delivered solid gains in the first quarter of 2017 despite a pullback by U.S. stocks late in the period amid dimming prospects for President Donald Trump's pro-business agenda.
U.S. stocks advanced for much of the period, extending the rally that began with President Trump's election in November. Responding to continued economic growth, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised its benchmark interest rate in March and indicated  that further rate hikes would be coming in 2017. Taking the Fed action as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy, stocks rose following the rate hike. Bank stocks led the advance on expectations that bank earnings would benefit from higher rates. Stro ng manufacturing and jobs data also boosted equity markets. During February, the U.S. added 235,000 new jobs, topping forecasts, while the unemployment rate remained steady at 4.7%.
But U.S stocks reversed course after President Trump's health care bill was withdrawn from Congress. The health care failure raised concerns about the prospects for the president's future economic initiatives, including tax reduction and infrastructure s pending. Equities recouped some of the lost ground in the final days of the three-month period.
Globally, signs of economic gains across a broad spectrum of regions encouraged investors during the period. In Asia, rising demand for semiconductors and other electronics boosted growth in the region's export-oriented economies. In Europe, positive eco nomic data and receding political risks helped push stocks higher. Even countries long mired in recession, such as Russia and Brazil, showed signs of recovery during the period.For the three-month period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average12 rec orded a 5.19% gain, while the broader S&P 500 Index13 rose 6.07%. The technology-laden NASDAQ Index14 added 9.82%. Globally, the MSCI EAFE Index15 rose 7.25% in the quarter. Large-cap stocks outperformed their small-cap counterparts during the qua rter. In terms of investing style, growth stocks topped value stocks in both the large-cap and small-cap categories.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (the Fund) underperformed its benchmark, the Russell 2500 Index (the Index),2 for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, returning 5.28% for Class I shares at net asset value versus the Index's 3.76% return

U.S. small- and mid-cap stocks, as represented by the Index, hit an all-time high in March. Interestingly, the sectors that drove performance this quarter were quite different from last quarter. The fourth quarter of 2016 was dominated by the "Trump Trad e," with strong gains in financials, energy, industrials and materials.  That largely reversed in first quarter 2017 as energy, financials and industrials all underperformed.  Performance in the first quarter was largely driven by health care, informatio n technology, materials and utilities.
The Fund outperformed the Index during the quarter, driven by both positive stock selection and sector allocation.
Notable contributors at the sector level were health care, financials and energy. Detracting from performance were the consumer discretionary and materials sectors.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

Selection gains were greatest in financials, health care and consumer staples. The strongest contributions from sector allocation came from underweights to energy and real estate and overweights to information technology and health care.
The health care sector had the largest positive impact on relative performance, contributing from good stock selection and sector allocation. In particular, Fund holdings in the health care equipment and supplies industry made a substantive impact.
The Fund's top five individual performance contributors included two health care companies (Teleflex Incorporated and IDEXX Laboratories), two information technology firms (Ansys, Inc. and Blackbaud, Inc.) and an industrial  stock (TransUnion).



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's relative performance compared to the Index during the quarter:

Stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector detracted from performance. Selection in information technology detracted to a lesser degree.
In consumer discretionary, stock selection in the specialty retail industry created a drag on performance. In information technology, stock selection proved difficult in the software industry during the quarter despite it being a top contributor from an  allocation standpoint.
The Fund's five primary individual detractors included two industrial stocks (Acuity Brands and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.), a consumer discretionary holding (Sally Beauty), and an information technology company (Wex Inc.).



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
Small- and mid-cap valuations remain stubbornly high, with the Russell 2500 SMID Cap index2 trading at a forward Price-to-Earnings multiple of 19.6x.  The Russell 2000 small cap index is at 19x (and closer to 26x if you included the impact of companie s with negative earnings).  To put that into context, the small cap benchmark has only traded at a higher valuation for a grand total of seven months out of the last 38 years.  While expensive, valuation measures like P/E are typically terrible short-ter m market predictors; so markets could stay at these valuations or even get more expensive from here. Over the long term, we think the price an investor pays for a stock matters and has a meaningful impact on total return. 

Rich market valuation creates  both challenges and opportunities. One of the biggest risks of investing in an expensive market is that it gets cheaper. In times when most stocks look expensive, we believe it is critical that the names in a portfolio are high quality, like those we see k to own in the strategy.
As of quarter-end, the Fund contained 50 stocks representing nine of the 11 economic sectors comprising the Index. Our bottom-up focus on quality continues to drive our relative sector over- and underweights. Relative to the sector weightings in the Inde x, the Fund was overweight information technology, industrials, health care and financials. The Fund was underweight real estate, consumer discretionary, consumer staples, energy and materials and had no exposure to utilities or telecommunication service s.

		Investment Strategy		
The Westcore Smid-Cap Value Dividend Fund invests primarily in the stocks of small- to medium-sized dividend-paying companies that appear to be undervalued. We build the portfolio with what we believe are the “best ideas” generated from our small- and mid-cap value portfolios.
We combine our independent fundamental research with strict adherence to our style and risk controls to help us uncover small- and medium-sized dividend-paying companies whose future cash flow and return on invested capital appear to be undervalued by the market. Through analyzing business models, evaluating products, management and competitive sustainability, we build this diversified smid-cap value portfolio with what we believe are high-quality companies with the most attractive risk reward characteristics.
This Fund is available in both the retail and institutional class.
Management Team
We look for dividend-paying, cash-flow generating businesses at attractive prices. By combining the ‘best ideas’ from our Small-Cap and Mid-Cap strategies, we believe we create a powerful approach that may preserve capital in down markets while also participating in up markets. – Derek R.

NEW FUND RISK: There can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size. There may be limited or no performance history for investors to evaluate.
Investing in small- and mid-cap funds generally will be more volatile and loss of principal could be greater than investing in large-cap funds.
Dividends are not guaranteed. A company’s future abilities to pay dividends may be limited and a company may cease paying dividends at any time.

The risk profile spectrum provides an approximate illustration of the relative volatility of the Westcore Family of Funds determined by using each fund’s 5-year annualized standard deviation as of 3/31/17. If the fund’s retail class has less than five years of operations as of that date, the standard deviation of the fund’s Morningstar category is used instead. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the historical volatility of a fund, which we believe can assist in classifying a fund within a risk spectrum. The placement on the risk spectrum (Low to High) is based on the comparison of each Fund’s standard deviation measure, as described above, in relation to the universe of funds with a 5-year standard deviation measure as obtained from a third-party fund database. We believe those measures are accurate but have not independently verified them. Please refer to the prospectus for each fund’s specific risks. Also a fund’s measure of volatility is subject to change without notice as market or economic conditions change, and such changes may include significant and nonrecurring volatility events. Historical volatility is not necessarily indicative of future volatility and there is no guarantee that in any time period any one fund will be more or less volatile than any other fund.

Please see the prospectus for more detailed information regarding investment minimums. The Funds reserve the right to change the amount of these minimums from time to time or to waive them in whole or in part, including the right to waive the Institutional Class minimums, if in the Advisor’s sole opinion, the investor has adequate intent and availability of assets to reach a future level of investment in the Fund that is equal to or greater than the minimum.

2 The minimum investment in the Institutional Class shares is $250,000. Investors generally may meet the minimum investment amount by aggregating multiple accounts with common ownership within the Fund. Common ownership includes individual and joint accounts as well as accounts where an investor has beneficial ownership through acting as a custodian for a minor account or as a beneficiary to a trust account. In addition, Institutional Class accounts offered through a financial intermediary may meet the $250,000 minimum investment amount by aggregating multiple accounts within the Fund, however each separate account must meet a minimum investment requirement of $10,000. Exceptions to the Institutional Class minimums may apply for qualified requirement plans and other account types with lower or no networking and/or omnibus fees charged to the Funds.

Investing in small- and mid-cap funds generally will be more volatile and loss of principal could be greater than investing in large-cap funds.
Dividends are not guaranteed. A company’s future abilities to pay dividends may be limited and a company may cease paying dividends at any time.
Performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Performance information for the institutional class shares prior to their inception is based on the performance of the retail class. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. To obtain current performance as of the most recent month-end, please call 800.392.CORE(2673). Average annual total returns reflect the reinvestment of dividends, capital gains distributions, all fee waivers and expense reimbursements. If imposed, the fee would reduce the performance quoted.

Westcore fund shares are not insured by the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or any other agency and are subject to investment risk.
Denver Investments (the “Adviser”) has contractually agreed to waive certain investment advisory and/or administration fees and/or to reimburse other expenses from April 30, 2017 until at least April 30, 2018. The first waiver/reimbursement applies so that the ratio of expenses to average net assets, as reported in the Fund’s financial statements, will be no more than a fixed percentage for the Fund’s Retail Class for such period. Please see the Fund’s Prospectus for more information. The second waiver/reimbursement applies so that Fund level Other Expenses (as defined in the Fund’s financial statements) for the Institutional Class will be in the same proportion as the Retail Class waivers/reimbursements. The third waiver/reimbursement applies so that the institutional class-specific Other Expenses are reimbursed. The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive/reimburse all of these class-specific Other Expenses, but only to the extent that the difference between the net Institutional Class and net Retail Class expense ratios, after applying the waiver/reimbursement, does not exceed 25 basis points. These agreements may not be terminated or modified prior to April 30, 2018 without the approval of the Board of Trustees.

Manager Commentary as of 3/31/2017
 
Market Overview
Smid-cap value stocks continued to move higher in the first quarter, even as the “risk-on” trade lost steam as investors became more defensive, particularly in March. We witnessed a clear change in sector leadership in the quarter as more cyclical sectors, such as energy and interest rate sensitive, underperformed, while more defensive sectors, such as medical/healthcare and utilities, took the lead.  Within the interest rate sensitive sector, banks pulled back, reversing some of their fourth quarter gains. This occurred as the Federal Reserve raised rates during the quarter and suggested more near-term rate hikes might be appropriate. The market’s excitement around potential policy changes, such as infrastructure spending, de-regulation, and tax reform, appeared to fade. At the same time, concerns around policy uncertainty and signs of a peaking domestic economy weighed on various industries and sectors.
Fund Performance
For the first quarter of 2017, the Westcore Smid-Cap Value Dividend Fund returned -0.40%, underperforming the 1.62% return of its benchmark, the Russell 2500TM Value Index. Our smid-cap value strategy faced headwinds in the quarter as more volatile stocks and stocks that don’t pay a dividend did well. 
Contributors to Return
The Fund’s top-contributing sectors relative to its benchmark in the quarter were REITs and utilities. Within REITs, the Fund’s standout performer was prison owner and operator GEO Group Inc. The stock continued a strong post-election run as the outlook for Federal use of private prisons improved. Performance was also driven by solid fourth quarter results as well as announcements of several pending opportunities. We look for further positive announcements over the next few months as government budgets are appropriated and new leases are able to be signed. Another strong contributor to the Fund’s outperformance in the REIT sector was CyrusOne Inc., a data center facility provider for mission-critical data. CyrusOne recorded solid fourth quarter results that were slightly better than expectations. While signed leases were modest, given that the company has virtually no space to sell, sales were up meaningfully in both cloud and enterprise spaces. We expect CyrusOne to produce solid cash flow growth as a record number of 2016 leases commence and it begins adding build-to-suit projects to put capital to work at attractive returns. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., a developer, manufacturer, and distributor of tires and related products, was another top-contributing holding for the quarter. A continuation of favorable U.S. tire industry trends and a volatile commodity environment, that was well-managed by the company, led to financial results that met expectations. Although our thesis remains intact and management is executing well, we trimmed the Fund’s position in the quarter, given the share price strength.
Detractors from Return
The sectors that detracted most from the Fund’s performance relative to its benchmark were interest rate sensitive, medical/healthcare, and technology. AmTrust Financial Services Inc., a provider of insurance services primarily to small businesses, was the Fund’s largest detractor within the interest rate sensitive sector. The company reported 2016 results that were very much in line with our expectations, but disappointed the market by announcing the delay of its annual report. The delay was due to questions regarding the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses. We expect this to have a relatively limited impact on reported earnings and more importantly, no impact on cash flows. Generic pharmaceutical and ingredient producer Aceto Corp. was the Fund’s main detractor in the medical/healthcare sector. The market’s downward revision of expectations for generic drug pricing, along with Aceto’s financial results missing expectations, led to the company’s underperformance. We believe little has changed within its product filing pipeline and think the market is giving very little credit to the company’s stable base business. Consumer sector holding Cato Corp., a women’s fashions and accessories retailer, was another detractor. During the quarter, past merchandizing missteps by Cato’s design/sourcing team were magnified due to same-store sales declines in the fourth quarter a weak apparel environment, and increased online competition. Management has taken corrective actions that we believe are in the final stages of implementation. Cato’s balance sheet remains very strong and inventories are in better shape. We believe that the risk/reward presents us with an attractive opportunity with easier sales comparisons ahead.  
Outlook and Positioning
We believe uncertainty regarding the outlook for economic growth will continue and that concerns around successful policy implementation will remain heightened. The uncertainty has resulted in a wavering of the post-election market euphoria as questions regarding economic growth and policy changes remain unanswered. This, coupled with historically high valuations, in our opinion, is a recipe for continued volatility. In this type of an environment, we believe any company-specific disappointments are likely to be severely and often overly punished. This would create near-term pain, but also may offer opportunities to invest in companies at prices below what we believe they are worth.

The Manager Commentaries contain certain forward-looking statements about the factors that may affect the performance of the Funds in the future. These statements are based on Fund management’s predictions and expectations concerning certain future events and their expected impact on the Funds, such as performance of the economy as a whole and of specific industry sectors, changes in the levels of interest rates, the impact of developing world events, and other factors that may influence the future performance of the Funds. Management believes these forward-looking statements to be reasonable, although they are inherently uncertain and difficult to predict.

The risk profile spectrum provides an approximate illustration of the relative volatility of the Westcore Family of Funds determined by using each fund’s 5-year annualized standard deviation as of 9/30/16. If the fund’s retail class has less than five years of operations as of that date, the standard deviation of the fund’s Morningstar category is used instead. Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the historical volatility of a fund, which we believe can assist in classifying a fund within a risk spectrum. The placement on the risk spectrum (Low to High) is based on the comparison of each Fund’s standard deviation measure, as described above, in relation to the universe of funds with a 5-year standard deviation measure as obtained from a third-party fund database. We believe those measures are accurate but have not independently verified them. Please refer to the prospectus for each fund’s specific risks. Also a fund’s measure of volatility is subject to change without notice as market or economic conditions change, and such changes may include significant and nonrecurring volatility events. Historical volatility is not necessarily indicative of future volatility and there is no guarantee that in any time period any one fund will be more or less volatile than any other fund.
 
Distributions
The Westcore Smid-Cap Value Dividend Fund pays any income and capital gain distributions at least annually, generally in December.

Past performance does not guarantee future results.
A fund’s income from dividends and interest and any net realized short-term capital gains are paid to shareholders as income dividends. A fund realizes capital gains whenever it sells securities for a higher price than it paid for them. Net realized long-term gains are paid to shareholders as capital gain dividends. A dividend will reduce the net asset value of a fund share by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date. View the prospectus for more information.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

2 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 2 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 576 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks maximum capital appreciation, consistent with reasonable risk to principal, by investing primarily in small- and mid-market capitalization (small- and mid-cap) companies.




Strategy



Under normal circumstances, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities of small- and mid-cap ("SMID Cap") companies. The fund focuses on U.S. companies with total market capitalizations (number of shares outstanding multiplied by share price) that at the time of initial purchase fall within the range of companies in the Russell 2500 Index at reconstitution each June.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average

This fund scores Below Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Low


This fund scores Low because it delivered returns that were in the bottom 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. The securities of smaller, less well-known companies can be more volatile than those of larger companies. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.
7. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
8. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
9. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
10. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.
12. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 2/28/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time. After the expiration date, the expense cap and/or waiver may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.

PMV SMID Cap Equity

The SMID Cap Equity strategy invests primarily in stocks of small- and mid-capitalization companies that are believed to be underpriced yet have attractive growth prospects. The investment team bases its analysis on a company's private market valuation—the price an acquirer would be willing to pay for the entire company given its management, financial health, and growth potential.
