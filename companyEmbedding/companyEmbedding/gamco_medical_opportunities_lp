Item 1. Security and Issuer
This Amendment No. 3 to Schedule 13D on the Common Stock of Inventure Foods, Inc. (the "Issuer") is being filed on behalf of the undersigned to amend the Schedule 13D, as amended (the "Schedule 13D") which was originally filed on April 4, 2016.  Unless otherwise indicated, all capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the same meanings as set forth in the Schedule 13D.


Item 2. Identity and Background
Item 2 to Schedule 13D is amended, in pertinent part, as follows:
This statement is being filed by Mario J. Gabelli ("Mario Gabelli") and various entities which he
directly or indirectly controls or for which he acts as chief investment officer.  These entities, except for LICT Corporation ("LICT), CIBL, Inc. ("CIBL") and ICTC Group, Inc.

The foregoing persons in the aggregate often own beneficially more than 5% of a class of equity securities of a particular issuer.  Although several of the foregoing persons are treated as institutional investors for purposes of reporting their beneficial ownership on the short-form Schedule 13G, the holdings of those who do not qualify as institutional investors may exceed the 1% threshold presented for filing on Schedule 13G or implementation of their investment philosophy may from time to time require action which could be viewed as not completely passive.  In order to avoid any question as to whether their beneficial ownership is being reported on the proper form and in order to provide greater investment flexibility and administrative uniformity, these persons have decided to file their beneficial ownership reports on the more detailed Schedule 13D form rather than on the short-form Schedule 13G and thereby to provide more expansive disclosure than may be necessary.

For information required by instruction C to Schedule 13D with respect to the executive officers and directors of the foregoing entities and other related persons (collectively, “Covered Persons”), reference is made to Schedule I annexed hereto and incorporated herein by reference. (d) – Not applicable. (e) – Not applicable.  (f) – Reference is made to Schedule I hereto.  Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration The Reporting Persons used an aggregate of approximately $28,666,350 to purchase the Securities reported as beneficially owned in Item 5.  GAMCO and Gabelli Funds used approximately $3,647,986 and $19,965,586,  respectively, of funds that were provided through the accounts of certain of their investment advisory clients (and, in the case of some of such accounts at GAMCO, may be through borrowings from client margin accounts) in order to purchase the Securities for such clients.  GSI used approximately $5,052,778 of client funds to purchase the Securities reported by it.  Item 4. Purpose of Transaction                              Each of the Reporting Persons has purchased and holds the Securities reported by it for investment for one or more accounts over which it has shared, sole, or both investment and/or voting power, for its own account, or both. The Reporting Persons are engaged in the business of securities analysis and investment. The Reporting Persons analyze the operations, capital structure and markets of companies in which they invest, including the Issuer, on a continuous basis through analysis of documentation and discussions with knowledgeable industry and market observers and with representatives of such companies (often at the invitation of management).  As a result of these analytical activities one or more of the Reporting Persons may issue analysts reports, participate in interviews or hold discussions with third parties, with management or with Directors in which the Reporting Person may suggest or take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations, management or capital structure of such companies as a means of enhancing shareholder values.  Such suggestions or positions may relate to one or more of the transactions specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D including, without limitation, such matters as disposing of one or more businesses, selling the company or acquiring another company or business, changing operating or marketing strategies, adopting or not adopting, certain types of anti-takeover measures and restructuring the company’s capitalization or dividend policy. Each of the Reporting Persons intends to adhere to the foregoing investment philosophy with respect to the Issuer.  However, none of the Reporting Persons intends to seek control of the Issuer or participate in the management of the Issuer, and any Reporting Person that is registered as an investment company under the Company Act will participate in such a transaction only following receipt of an exemption from the SEC under Rule 17d-1 under the Company Act, if required, and in accordance with other applicable law.  In pursuing this investment philosophy, each Reporting Person will continuously assess the Issuer’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, general economic conditions, the securities markets in general and those for the Issuer’s securities in particular, other developments and other investment opportunities, as well as the investment objectives and diversification requirements of its shareholders or clients and its fiduciary duties to such shareholders or clients.  Depending on such assessments, one or more of the Reporting Persons may acquire additional Securities or may determine to sell or otherwise dispose of all or some of its holdings of Securities.  Although the Reporting Persons share the same basic investment philosophy and although most portfolio decisions are made by or under the supervision of Mario Gabelli, the investment objectives and diversification requirements of various clients differ from those of other clients so that one or more Reporting Persons may be acquiring Securities while others are disposing of Securities. With respect to voting of the Securities, the Reporting Persons have adopted general voting policies relating to voting on specified issues affecting corporate governance and shareholder values.  Under these policies, the Reporting Persons generally vote all securities over which they have voting power in favor of cumulative voting, financially reasonable golden parachutes, one share one vote, management cash incentives and pre-emptive rights and against greenmail, poison pills, supermajority voting, blank check preferred stock and super-dilutive stock options.  Exceptions may be made when management otherwise demonstrates superior sensitivity to the needs of shareholders.  In the event that the aggregate voting position of all Reporting Persons exceeds 25% of the total voting position of the Issuer, one or more of the filing persons may transfer voting and/or dispositive power over shares to independent committees of directors or the owners of such shares. Such committees vote and/or consider disposition of such shares independently of the Reporting Persons. Each of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting Person has purchased the Securities reported herein as beneficially owned by him for investment for his own account or that of one or more members of his immediate family.  Each such person may acquire additional Securities or dispose of some or all of the Securities reported herein with respect to him. Other than as described above, none of the Reporting Persons and none of the Covered Persons who is not a Reporting Person has any present plans or proposals which relate to or would result in any transaction, change or event specified in clauses (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  Item 5. Interest In Securities Of The Issuer (a) The aggregate number of Securities to which this Schedule 13D relates is 1,550,668 shares, representing 9.82% of the 15,788,585 shares outstanding as reported in the Issuer’s most recently filed Form 10K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  The Reporting Persons beneficially own those Securities as follows:  Name   Shares of Common Stock   % of Class of Common   GAMCO  Gabelli Funds  GSI    197,500  1,079,262  273,906    1.25%  6.84%  1.73%   Mario Gabelli is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the Securities owned beneficially by each of the foregoing persons.  GSI is deemed to have beneficial ownership of the Securities owned beneficially by G.research.  AC, GBL and GGCP are deemed to have beneficial ownership of the Securities owned beneficially by each of the foregoing persons other than Mario Gabelli and the Foundation. (b) Each of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons has the sole power to vote or direct the vote and sole power to dispose or to direct the disposition of the Securities reported for it, either for its own benefit or for the benefit of its investment clients or its partners, as the case may be, except that (i) Gabelli Funds has sole dispositive and voting power with respect to the shares of the Issuer held by the Funds so long as the aggregate voting interest of all joint filers does not exceed 25% of their total voting interest in the Issuer and, in that event, the Proxy Voting Committee of each Fund shall respectively vote that Fund’s shares, (ii) at any time, the Proxy Voting Committee of each such Fund may take and exercise in its sole discretion the entire voting power with respect to the shares held by such fund under special  circumstances such as regulatory considerations, and (iii) the power of Mario Gabelli, AC, GBL, and GGCP is indirect with respect to Securities beneficially owned directly by other Reporting Persons. (c) Information with respect to all transactions in the Securities which were effected during the past sixty days or since the most recent filing on Schedule 13D, whichever is less, by each of the Reporting Persons and Covered Persons is set forth on Schedule II annexed hereto and incorporated herein by reference.  (d) The investment advisory clients of, or partnerships managed by, GAMCO, Gabelli Funds, Teton Advisors and MJG Associates have the sole right to receive and, subject to the notice, withdrawal and/or termination provisions of such advisory contracts and partnership arrangements, the sole power to direct the receipt of dividends from, and the proceeds of sale of, any of the Securities beneficially owned by such Reporting Persons on behalf of such clients or partnerships.  Except as noted, no such client or partnership has an interest by virtue of such relationship that relates to more than 5% of the Securities. (e) Not applicable.  Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer The powers of disposition and voting of Gabelli Funds, Teton Advisors, GAMCO, GSI and MJG Associates with respect to Securities owned beneficially by them on behalf of their investment advisory clients, and of MJG Associates and GSI with respect to Securities owned beneficially by them on behalf of the partnerships or corporations which they directly or indirectly manage, are held pursuant to written agreements with such clients, partnerships and funds.

GAMCO INVESTORS, INC. ET AL - 10-K/A - 20071109 - BUSINESS





	ITEM
	1: BUSINESS






	Unless
	we have indicated otherwise, or the context otherwise
	requires, references in this report to “GAMCO Investors, Inc.,” “GBL,” “we,”
	“us” and “our” or similar terms are to GAMCO Investors, Inc., its predecessors
	and its subsidiaries.






	Overview






	GAMCO
	Investors, Inc. (NYSE: GBL), well known for its Private Market
	Value (PMV) with a Catalyst

	TM

	 investment
	approach,

	 

	is a widely-recognized provider of investment advisory
	services to mutual funds, institutional and high net worth investors, and
	investment partnerships, principally in the United States.  Through
	Gabelli & Company, Inc., we provide institutional research services to
	institutional clients and investment partnerships.  We generally
	manage assets on a discretionary basis and invest in a variety of U.S. and
	international securities through various investment styles.  Our
	revenues are based primarily on the firm’s levels of assets under management and
	fees associated with our various investment products.





	Since
	1977, we have been identified with and enhanced the “value”
	style approach to investing. Over the 29 years since the inception of the firm,
	consistent with our fundamental objective of providing an absolute rate of
	return for our clients, GBL generated over $15 billion in investment returns
	for
	our institutional and high net worth clients.  The 29 year CARR
	(compounded annual rate of return) for the institutional client (as measured
	by
	our composite return) approached 19% on a gross basis and 18% on a net basis,
	and in 2006 we produced $2.1 billion and 23.2% net returns for our institutional
	clients. Our mission statement, our investment objective is to earn a superior
	risk-adjusted return for our clients over the long-term through our proprietary
	fundamental research.  In addition to our value portfolios, we offer
	our clients a broad array of investment strategies that include global, growth,
	international and convertible products.  We also offer a series of
	investment partnership (performance fee-based) vehicles that provide a series
	of
	long-short investment opportunities in market and sector specific opportunities,
	including offerings of non-market correlated investments in merger arbitrage,
	as
	well as fixed income strategies.





	As
	of December 31, 2006, we had $28.1 billion of assets under
	management (AUM), 97% of which were in equity products.  We conduct
	our investment advisory business principally through: GAMCO Asset Management
	Inc. (Separate Accounts), Gabelli Funds, LLC (Mutual Funds) and Gabelli
	Securities, Inc. (Investment Partnerships).  We also act as an
	underwriter, are a distributor of our open-end mutual funds and provide
	institutional research through Gabelli & Company, Inc., our broker-dealer
	subsidiary.

	Our
	assets under management are organized into three groups:












	·  









	Investment
	Partnerships:



	 

	we provide advisory services to
	limited partnerships, offshore funds and separate accounts, and also
	serve
	as a sub-advisor to certain third-party investment funds across merger
	arbitrage, global and regional long/short equity, and sector-focused
	strategies (“Investment Partnerships”).  We managed a total of
	$491 million in Investment Partnership assets on December 31,
	2006.















	·  








	Separate
	Accounts:


	we provide
	advisory services to a broad range of investors, including high net
	worth
	individuals, corporate pension and profit-sharing plans, foundations,
	endowments, jointly-trusteed plans and municipalities, and also serve
	as
	sub-advisor to certain other third-party investment funds including
	registered investment companies (“Separate Accounts”).  Each
	Separate Account portfolio is managed to meet the specific needs
	and
	objectives of the particular client by utilizing investment strategies
	and
	techniques within our areas of expertise.  On December 31, 2006,
	we had $12.7 billion of Separate Account assets under
	management.















	·  








	Open
	and Closed-End Funds:


	we
	provide advisory services to (i) twenty open-end mutual funds and
	seven
	closed-end funds under Gabelli, GAMCO and Comstock brands; and (ii)
	six
	mutual funds within the Westwood family of funds (collectively, the
	“Mutual Funds”).  The Mutual Funds had $14.9 billion of assets
	under management on December 31, 2006. In January 2007, we launched
	the
	Gabelli Global Deal Fund (NYSE: GDL), a closed-end fund that invests
	primarily in announced merger and acquisition transactions and, to
	a
	lesser extent, in corporate reorganizations involving stubs, spin-offs
	and
	liquidations. 










	GAMCO
	Investors, Inc. is a holding company formed in connection with
	our initial public offering (“Offering”) in February 1999.  GGCP, Inc.
	owns a majority of the outstanding shares of class B common stock of GAMCO
	Investors, Inc., which ownership represented approximately 95% of the combined
	voting power of the outstanding common stock and approximately 72% of the
	equity
	interest on December 31, 2006.  GGCP, Inc. is majority-owned by Mr.
	Mario J. Gabelli (“Mr. Gabelli”) with the balance owned by our professional
	staff and other individuals.  Accordingly, Mr. Gabelli could be deemed
	to control GAMCO Investors, Inc.






	Our
	corporate name change to GAMCO Investors, Inc. became effective
	August 29, 2005.  GAMCO is a more inclusive parent company name and
	more appropriately represents the various investment strategies and asset
	management brands of our company.





	Our
	principal executive offices are located at One Corporate Center,
	Rye, New York 10580.  Our telephone number is (914)
	921-5100.  We post or provide a link on our website,

	practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the
	Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K,

	Performance
	Highlights








	Separate
	Accounts






	Institutional
	clients of our institutional and high net worth asset
	management business have achieved a compound annual return of approximately
	18%
	on a net basis in our separate accounts composite for over 29 years since
	inception through December 31, 2006. In 2006, the institutional composite return
	was a 23.2% net return. These accounts in this composite have been managed
	in
	the absolute return, research-driven PMV with a Catalyst

	TM

	style
	since inception.

	The
	GAMCO Value composite represents fully discretionary,
	tax-exempt institutional accounts managed for at least one full quarter
	and meeting minimum account size requirements.  The minimum size
	requirement for inclusion in 1985 was $500,000; 1986, $1 million;
	and 1987
	and thereafter, $5 million. The performance calculations include
	accounts
	under management during the respective periods. As of 12/31/06, the
	GAMCO
	Value composite included 40 accounts with an aggregate market value
	of
	$4.1 billion.  No two portfolios are
	identical.  Accounts not within this size and type may have
	experienced different results.

	GAMCO
	Value performance results are computed on a
	total-return basis, which includes all dividends, interest, and realized
	and unrealized gains and losses.  The summary of past
	performance is not intended as a prediction of future
	results.  Returns are presented in U.S. dollars.  The
	inception date of the GAMCO Value composite is
	10/1/77.

	The
	compound annual growth rate from 1990 to present is net
	of actual fees and actual transaction costs.  The compound
	annual growth rate before 1990 reflects the calculation of a model
	investment fee (1% compounded quarterly) and actual transaction
	costs.

	capitalization stocks and performance represents total return of
	the index
	including reinvestment of dividends.  The performance figures
	for the Russell 2000 are based on an inception date of
	1/1/79.  The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 do not necessarily
	reflect how a managed portfolio of equity securities would have
	performed.  The CPI is a widely-used measure of inflation, and
	the CPI+10 measure is used to show the results that would have been
	achieved by obtaining a rate of return that exceeded the CPI by a
	constant
	10% as a basis of comparison versus the results of the GAMCO

	2006
	Highlights






	Since
	our initial public offering in February 1999, GBL has generated
	a 129% total return (including dividends) for its shareholders through December
	31, 2006 versus a total return of 31% (including dividends) for the S&P 500
	Index during the same period.  Our class A common stock, which is
	traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “GBL”, ended the year at
	a closing market price of $38.46.





	During
	2006, we returned $58.0 million of our earnings to
	shareholders through our stock buyback program and $3.4 million, or $0.12 per
	share, in dividends to our common shareholders. We purchased approximately
	1.3
	million shares for $54.6 million, an investment of $40.88 per share.





	In
	2006, we reported earnings of $2.49 per fully diluted share (as
	restated) vs. $2.11 (as restated) per fully diluted share in
	2005.  Our net income for the full year ended December 31, 2006 was
	$71.9 million (as restated) versus $63.9 million (as restated) in the 2005
	period, and revenues were $261.5 million in 2006 compared to $253.3 million
	(as
	restated) in the prior year.  Our 2006 earnings are after $0.34 per
	fully diluted share related to a regulatory issue.  See Recent
	regulatory developments.





	We
	ended 2006 with equity AUM of $27.3 billion versus $26.0 billion
	on December 31, 2005.  Overall, assets under management were $28.1
	billion on December 31, 2006 versus $26.8 billion at the end of
	2005.  Our equity open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds reached a
	record AUM of $14.2 billion on December 31, 2006, an increase of approximately
	9.2% from year-end 2005 of $13.0 billion, as our open-end equity mutual funds
	and closed-end funds had AUM of $8.4 billion and $5.8 billion,
	respectively.

	As
	in prior years, we experienced client “churn” in 2006. In the
	institutional and high net worth space, over one half of the assets lost were
	subadvisory assets where the advisor underwent a change in control, for
	instance, a spin-off from the parent organization or the sale of the advisor
	to
	a third party. The successor advisor assumed management of the assets.


	In
	January 2006, as part of a firm-wide branding initiative, the
	names of eight mutual funds managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC, a subsidiary of
	GAMCO
	Investors, Inc., were changed to GAMCO.  The GAMCO brand more
	appropriately differentiates the various investment strategies offered to
	investors including growth, gold, convertible securities and
	contrarian.  Funds continuing to use the Gabelli name primarily
	represent value portfolios managed in the absolute return, research-driven
	Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst

	TM

	 investment
	approach.





	Our
	$400 million "shelf" registration statement on Form S-3 filed
	with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) became effective in May 2006.
	Under this shelf registration, we may, from time to time, issue any combination
	of senior and subordinate debt securities, convertible debt securities and
	equity securities (including common and preferred securities) up to a total
	amount of $520 million. This includes the remaining $120 million available
	under
	our previous shelf registration filed in 2001.






	On
	June 30, 2006, we and Cascade Investment L.L.C. ("Cascade") agreed
	to amend the terms of the $50 million convertible note issued by us (the
	"Note")
	and maturing in August 2011, as follows: increase the coupon rate of interest
	to
	6% from 5% and raise the conversion price to $53 per GBL share from $52 per
	share, both effective on September 15, 2006. In addition, we and Cascade
	agreed
	to extend the exercise date for Cascade's put option until May 15, 2007.
	The
	expiration date of the related letter of credit was extended to May 22, 2007
	and
	a call option was included giving us the right to redeem the note at 101%
	of its
	principal amount together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon upon
	at
	least 30 days prior written notice, subject to certain provisions.






	Our
	research and institutional sales team at Gabelli & Company,
	Inc. hosted seven industry symposiums and conferences during
	2006.  These symposiums and conferences provided an opportunity for
	the firm’s institutional clients to meet with the senior management teams of
	leading companies and gain insight on the dynamics within these
	industries.  Our events in 2006 included our 30th annual Automotive
	Aftermarket Symposium, our 17

	th

	Pump Valve & Motor Symposium, our
	12

	th

	annual Aircraft Supplier Conference, Fourth annual Dental
	Conference, our second annual RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Conference,
	and our first annual Water Infrastructure conference.






	Business
	Strategy






	Our
	business strategy targets global growth of the franchise through
	continued leveraging of our proven asset management strengths including our
	brand name, long-term performance record, diverse product offerings and
	experienced investment, research and client service professionals.  In
	order to achieve growth in assets under management and profitability, we are
	pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements:











	·  








	Incentive
	Fees and Fulcrum
	Fees.


	Our investment strategy is focused on adding stock
	specific alpha through our proprietary Private Market Value (PMV)
	with a
	Catalyst

	TM

	equity research efforts.  We expect to receive
	an increasing portion of ourrevenues and earnings through various
	products
	with incentive and fulcrum fees.  Since we envision that a
	growing percentage of the firm's revenues will be directly linked
	to
	performance-based fees, this will also increase the variability of
	our
	revenues and profits.  As of December 31, 2006, over $1.5
	billion of separate account assets are managed on a performance fee
	basis
	along with $1.18 billion of preferred issues and $491 million of
	investment partnership assets.  Unlike most money management
	firms, we elected not to receive a management fee on preferred offerings
	in closed-end funds until the fund’s overall performance exceeds each
	preferred’s nominal cost of capital.  In January 2007, we launched
	the Gabelli Global Deal Fund, a new closed-end fund that earns a
	base fee
	plus a fulcrum performance fee of one quarter percent for each percentage
	point the fund's return exceeds the 90 day U. S. Treasury Bill rate,
	up to
	a maximum of 2 percent.  In addition, the incubation of new product
	strategies using proprietary capital will compensate the investment
	team
	with a performance fee model to reinforce our pay-for-performance
	approach.















	·  








	Corporate
	Branding
	Initiative.


	   We have undertaken a series of
	branding initiatives to enhance long-term shareholder value.  On
	August 29, 2005, our corporate name change to GAMCO Investors, Inc.
	became
	effective.  Since the firm was founded in 1977, GAMCO has been
	the name of our asset management business, representing our institutional
	and high net worth effort. We believe changing our corporate name
	to GAMCO
	helps us achieve our vision for assets entrusted to us, that is,
	to earn a
	superior return for our clients by providing various value-added
	(alpha)
	products. GAMCO is a more inclusive parent company name and more
	appropriately represents the various investment strategies and asset
	management brands contributing to the continued growth of our company.
	The
	Gabelli brand will continue to represent our absolute return,
	research-driven value style that focuses on our unique Private Market
	Value (PMV) with a Catalyst

	™

	investment
	approach.















	·  








	Establishing
	Research and Relationship
	Centers.


	In addition to our corporate office in Rye NY, we
	have six offices which conduct portfolio management, research and
	marketing activities in the United States and abroad in the following
	cities:  Greenwich CT, Chicago IL, Minneapolis MN, Palm Beach
	FL, Reno NV, and London UK.  Our offices in Chicago and
	Minneapolis were established as the result of acquisitions of on-going
	investment advisory operations.  The London office was opened in
	January 2000 to provide a geographic presence overseas and to coordinate
	investment research and marketing activities for our investment offerings
	in the European markets.

	Introducing
	New Products and
	Services.



	 

	We believe we have the
	capacity for development of new products and services around the
	Gabelli
	and GAMCO brands to complement our existing product offerings. New
	products since our initial public offering
	include:













	-  




	Three
	open-end mutual funds:  Gabelli Blue Chip
	Value Fund (1999), Gabelli Utilities Fund (1999) and the Gabelli
	Woodland
	Small Cap Value Fund (2003).






	 






	-  




	Four
	closed-end funds: The Gabelli Dividend & Income
	Trust, The Gabelli Global Utility and Income Trust, The Gabelli Global
	Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust, and The Gabelli Utility
	Trust.






	 






	-  




	Five
	offshore funds:  Gabelli Global Partners,
	Ltd., Gabelli European Partners, Ltd., Gabelli Japanese Value Partners,
	Ltd., GAMCO Performance Partners, Ltd., and GAMCO SRI Partners,
	Ltd.






	 






	-  




	Nine
	private limited partnerships:  Gemini Global
	Partners, L.P., Gabelli European Partners, L.P., Gabelli Japanese
	Value
	Partners, L.P., Gabelli Associates Fund II, L.P., GAMCO Performance
	Partners, L.P., GAMA Select Energy Plus, L.P., GAMCO Telecom Plus,
	L.P.
	GAMCO Medical Opportunities, L.P., and Gabelli Umbrella Fund,
	L.P.






	 





	During
	January 2007, we also launched the Gabelli Global Deal Fund
	(NYSE: GDL), a unique closed-end fund which will seek to achieve its investment
	objective of absolute return by investing primarily in announced merger and
	acquisition transactions and, to a lesser extent, in corporate reorganizations
	involving stubs, spin-offs and liquidations. This fund provides the advisor
	with a fulcrum fee, consistent with our strategy of alpha creation.

	Promulgating
	the Gabelli “




	Private Market Value (PMV) with a
	Catalyst





	TM




	”



	Investment
	Approach.  


	While we have expanded our investment
	product offerings, our “value investing” approach remains the core of our
	business.  This method is based on the value investing
	principles articulated by Graham & Dodd in 1934 and further augmented
	by Mario J. Gabelli with his development of Private Market Value
	(PMV)
	with a Catalyst

	TM


	 

	and his introduction of
	a catalyst into the value investment methodology.  The
	development of PMV analysis combined with the concept of a catalyst
	has
	evolved into our value investing approach, commonly referred to as
	Private
	Market Value (PMV) with a
	Catalyst

	TM


	 

	investing.














	 




	Private Market Value (PMV) with a
	Catalyst

	TM

	 investing is a disciplined, research-driven
	approach based on the extensive use of security analysis.  In
	this process, we carefully select stocks whose intrinsic value, based
	on
	our estimate of current asset value and future growth and earnings
	power,
	is significantly different from the value as reflected in the public
	market.  We then calculate the firm’s PMV, which is defined as
	the price an informed industrial buyer would be likely to pay to
	acquire
	the business.













	 




	To limit the time horizon in which the PMV is likely
	to be
	realized, we look for situations in which catalysts are working to
	help
	eliminate the premium or realize the discount between the public
	market
	price and the estimated PMV.  Catalysts which are company
	specific include:  realization of hidden assets, recognition of
	underperforming subsidiaries, share buybacks, spin-offs, mergers
	and
	acquisitions, balance sheet changes, new products, accounting changes,
	new
	management and cross-shareholder unwinding.  Other catalysts are
	related to industry dynamics or macroeconomics and include but are
	not
	limited to: industry consolidation, deregulation, accounting, tax,
	pension
	and political reforms, technological change and the macroeconomic
	backdrop.  The time horizons for catalysts to trigger change can
	either be short-term, medium-term or
	long-term.

	To further extend “value investing” and our fundamental
	research approach to stock selection:













	-  




	We
	sponsored Value Investing Seminars in Milan and London
	for institutional investors from leading UK and other European business
	schools.  The seminars were hosted by Bruce N. Greenwald, the
	Robert Heilbrunn Professor of Finance and Asset Management at Columbia
	University Graduate School of Business and the academic Director
	of the
	Heilbrunn Center for Graham & Dodd
	Investing.









	 






	-  




	We
	established the Graham & Dodd, Murray, Greenwald
	Prize for Value Investing in coordination with the Columbia University
	Graduate School of Business.  The monetary prize is awarded each
	year at GAMCO’s annual client meeting to the individual who best
	exemplifies the goals of refining, extending, and disseminating the
	practice of Value Investing.






	 









	-  




	GAMCO
	underwrote a series of lectures on Value Investing by
	Professor Roger F. Murray, the co-author of the Fifth Edition of

	Security Analysis

	.   This series of lectures
	served as a catalyst to re-focus the Columbia University Graduate
	School
	of Business’s curriculum to Value Investing, leading to the eventual
	creation of the Graham & Dodd Center.

	Expanding
	Mutual Fund
	Distribution.


	  We continue to expand our
	distribution network primarily through national and regional brokerage
	firms and have developed additional classes of shares for most of
	our
	mutual funds for sale through these firms and other third-party
	distribution channels on a commission basis.  We intend to
	increase our wholesaling efforts to market the multi-class shares,
	which
	have been designed to meet the needs of investors who seek advice
	through
	financial consultants.















	·  








	Increasing
	Presence in High Net Worth
	Market.


	  Our high net worth business focuses, in
	general, on serving clients who have established an account relationship
	of $1 million or more with us.  According to industry estimates,
	the number of households with over $1 million in investable assets
	will
	continue to grow in the future, subject to ups and downs in the equity
	and
	fixed income markets.  With our 30-year history of serving this
	segment, long-term performance record, customized portfolio approach,
	dominant, tax-sensitive, buy-hold investment strategy, brand name
	recognition and broad array of product offerings, we believe that
	we are
	well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities in this
	market.















	·  








	Increasing
	Marketing for Institutional Separate
	Accounts.


	  The institutional Separate Accounts
	business was principally developed through direct marketing channels.
	Historically, pension and financial consultants have not been a major
	source of new institutional Separate Accounts business for
	us.  We plan to augment our institutional sales force through
	the addition of staff to market directly to the consultant community
	as
	well as our traditional marketing
	channels.















	·  








	Attracting
	and Retaining Experienced
	Professionals.  


	We have increased the scope of our
	investment management capabilities by adding portfolio managers and
	other
	investment personnel in order to expand our broad array of
	products.  The ability to attract and retain highly-experienced
	investment and other professionals with a long-term commitment to
	us and
	our clients has been, and will continue to be, a significant factor
	in our
	long-term growth.

	Sponsorship
	of Industry Conferences.


	Gabelli & Company, Inc., our institutional research
	boutique, sponsors industry conferences and management events throughout
	the year. At these conferences and events, senior management from
	leading
	industry companies share their thoughts on the industry, competition,
	regulatory issues and the challenges and opportunities in their businesses
	with portfolio managers and securities analysts.  We currently
	host annual industry conferences and symposiums which include the
	Automotive Aftermarket Symposium (30 years), Pump Valve & Motor
	Symposium (17 years), Aircraft Supplier Conference (12 years), and
	Dental
	Conference (4 years).  Consistent with our innovative research
	on emerging technologies, we sponsored conferences focusing on RFID
	(Radio
	Frequency Identification) in 2006 as well as our first annual Water
	Infrastructure Conference.

	Capitalizing
	on Acquisitions and Strategic
	Alliances.


	  We intend to selectively and
	opportunistically pursue acquisitions and alliances that will broaden
	our
	product offerings and add new sources of distribution.  In
	November 2002, we completed our alliance with Woodland Partners LLC,
	a
	Minneapolis based investment advisor of institutional, high net-worth
	and
	sub-advisory accounts.  On October 1, 1999, we completed our
	alliance with Mathers and Company, Inc. and now act as investment
	advisor
	to the Mathers Fund (renamed GAMCO Mathers Fund), and in May 2000,
	we
	added Comstock Partners Funds, Inc., (renamed Comstock Funds,
	Inc.).  The Mathers and Comstock funds are part of our
	Non-Market Correlated mutual fund product
	line.









	We
	believe that we have the entrepreneurial flexibility and corporate
	resume to pursue acquisitions and alliances.





	We
	believe that our growth to date is tracable to the following
	factors:











	·  








	Strong
	Industry
	Fundamentals:


	  According to data compiled by the
	U.S. Federal Reserve, the investment management industry has grown
	faster
	than more traditional segments of the financial services industry,
	including the banking and insurance industries. Since GBL began managing
	institutional separate accounts in 1977, world equity markets have
	grown
	at a 12.6% compounded annual growth rate through December 31, 2006,
	including the net addition of new stocks in many countries, to $49.9
	trillion

	(a)

	.  The U.S. equity market comprises about
	$17.5 trillion

	(a)

	or 35.1% of world equity
	markets.  We believe that demographic trends and the growing
	role of money managers in the placement of capital compared to the
	traditional role played by banks and life insurance companies will
	result
	in continued growth of the investment management
	industry.















	·  








	Long-Term
	Performance:



	 

	We have a superior long-term
	record of achieving relatively high returns for our Separate Account
	clients. We believe that our performance record represents a competitive
	advantage and a recognized component of our
	franchise.















	·  








	Stock
	Market
	Gains:



	 

	Since we began managing
	institutional separate accounts in 1977, our traditional value-oriented
	separate account composite has earned a compound annual return of
	17.9%
	net of fees versus a compound annual return of 13.1% for
	the

	 

	S&P 500 through December 31,
	2006.  Since our initial public offering in February 1999
	through December 2006, the compound annual return for our traditional
	value-oriented separate account composite was 10.3% versus the S&P
	500’s compound annual total return of
	3.4%.















	·  








	Widely-Recognized
	“Gabelli”
	and
	“GAMCO”
	Brand
	Names:


	  For much of our history, our portfolio
	managers and investment products have been featured in a variety
	of
	financial print media, including both U.S. and international publications
	such as

	The


	Wall Street Journal, Financial Times, Money
	Magazine, Barron's, Fortune, Business Week, Nikkei Financial News,
	Forbes
	Magazine, Consumer Reports

	and

	Investor's Business Daily

	. We
	also underwrite publications written by our investment professionals,
	including  

	Deals…Deals…and More Deals

	which examines
	the practice of merger arbitrage and

	Global Convertible Investing: The
	Gabelli Way

	convertible securities.

	Diversified
	Product
	Offerings:


	  Since the inception of our investment
	management activities, we have sought to expand the breadth of our
	product
	offerings. We currently offer a wide spectrum of investment products
	and
	strategies, including product offerings in U.S. equities, U.S. fixed
	income, global and international equities, convertible securities,
	U.S.
	balanced and investment partnerships.









	Our
	financial strength is underscored by having received an
	investment grade rating from two well-respected ratings agencies, Moody’s
	Investors Services and Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services.  We
	believe that maintaining these investment grade ratings will provide greater
	access to the capital markets, enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing
	costs. However, we will also consider the use of leverage as part of our
	corporate financial strategy even if it results in a lowering of our investment
	rating.

	Business
	Description






	GBL
	was originally founded in 1976 as an institutional
	broker-dealer.  We entered the separate accounts business in 1977,
	management of investment partnerships in 1985 and the mutual fund business
	in
	1986.  Our initial product offerings centered on our tax sensitive,
	buy-hold, value-oriented investment philosophy.   Starting in the
	mid-1980s, we began building on our core value-oriented equity investment
	products by adding new investment strategies designed for a broad array of
	clients seeking to invest in growth-oriented equities, convertible securities
	and fixed income products.  Since then, we have continued to build our
	franchise by expanding our investment management capabilities through the
	addition of industry specific, international, global, non-market correlated,
	venture capital, leveraged buy-out and merchant banking product
	offerings.  Throughout our 30-year history, we have marketed most of
	our products under the “Gabelli” and “GAMCO” brand names.  Other
	brands include Mathers, Comstock, Westwood and Woodland.





	Our
	assets under management are organized principally in three
	groups:  Separate Accounts, Mutual Funds and Investment
	Partnerships.







	Separate
	Accounts – Institutional and High Net
	Worth:


	  Since 1977, we have provided investment
	management services through our subsidiary GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (“GAMCO”)
	to a broad spectrum of institutional and high net worth investors.  At
	December 31, 2006, we had $12.7 billion of assets under management (AUM) in
	approximately 1,700 separate accounts, representing approximately 45% of our
	total AUM. We currently provide advisory services to a broad range of investors,
	the majority of which (in total number of accounts) are high net worth client
	accounts – defined as individuals and their retirement assets generally having
	minimum account balances of $1 million.  As of December 31, 2006,
	Institutional client accounts, which include corporate pension and profit
	sharing plans, jointly-trusteed plans and public funds, represented 43% of
	the
	Separate Accounts assets and 8% of the accounts. High net worth accounts
	comprised approximately 83% of the total number of Separate Accounts and
	approximately 29% of the assets as of December 31, 2006.





	High
	net worth clients are attracted to us by our gross returns and
	the tax efficient nature of the underlying investment process in these
	traditional products.  Foundation and endowment fund assets
	represented an additional 9% of the number of Separate Accounts and
	approximately 10% of the assets.  The sub-advisory portion of the
	Separate Accounts (where we act as sub-advisor to certain other third-party
	investment funds) held approximately $2.3 billion or 18% of total Separate
	Account assets with less than 1% of the number of accounts.





	The
	ten largest relationships comprised approximately 43% of our
	total Separate Account assets under management and approximately 24% of our
	total Separate Account revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2006,
	respectively.





	In
	general, our Separate Accounts are managed under the GAMCO brand
	to meet the specific needs and objectives of each client by utilizing investment
	strategies – traditional “value”, “large cap value”, “large cap growth”,
	“global”, “international growth” and “convertible bonds” – and techniques that
	are within our areas of expertise.  We distinguish between taxable and
	tax-free assets and manage client portfolios with tax sensitivity within given
	investment strategies.

	At
	December 31, 2006, over 85% of our assets in Separate Accounts
	(excluding sub-advisory assets) were obtained through direct sales
	relationships.  Sales efforts are conducted on a regional and product
	specialist basis.  Members of the sales and marketing staff for the
	Separate Accounts business have an average of more than ten years of experience
	with us and focus on developing and maintaining direct, long-term relationships
	with their Separate Account clients.  The firm will host its 22

	nd

	Annual Client Conference in April 2007. This two-day event will
	kick off
	with a gathering at the American Museum of Natural History in New York followed
	by presentations by our portfolio managers and analysts the following
	day.  Along with these client seminars, we continue to establish and
	staff relationship offices around the country.





	We
	act as a sub-advisor on certain funds for several large and
	well-known fund managers.  Similar to corporate clients, sub-advisory
	clients are also subject to business combinations which may result in the
	curtailment of product distribution or the termination of the
	relationship.





	Investment
	advisory agreements for our Separate Accounts are
	typically subject to termination by the client without penalty on 30 days'
	notice or less.







	Open
	and Closed-End Funds:


	  We
	provide advisory services to (a) twenty open-end mutual funds and seven
	closed-end funds of which one open-end fund is managed by an unaffiliated
	advisor; and (b) the Westwood family of funds, consisting of six open-end mutual
	funds, five of which are managed on a day-to-day basis by Westwood Management
	Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westwood Holdings Group (collectively,
	the "Mutual Funds").  At December 31, 2006, we had $14.9 billion of
	AUM in open-end mutual funds and closed-end funds, representing approximately
	53% of our total AUM.  Our equity mutual funds and closed-end funds
	reached a record $14.2 billion in AUM on December 31, 2006, 9.2% ahead of the
	$13.0 billion on December 31, 2005.





	During
	December 2005 eight open-end Mutual Funds changed their
	brand to GAMCO from Gabelli.  The GAMCO brand more appropriately
	represents the various investment strategies offered to investors by Gabelli
	Funds, including growth, gold, convertible securities and
	contrarian.  Funds continuing to use the Gabelli name primarily
	represent value portfolios managed in the absolute return, research-driven
	Private Market Value (PMV) with a Catalyst

	TM

	style.  This
	name change has no effect on the management, the investment objective, or the
	investment strategy of each fund.





	The
	eight GAMCO branded open-end mutual funds are:

	Open-end
	Funds






	On
	December 31, 2006, we had $9.1 billion of AUM in twenty six
	open-end mutual funds. At year-end, of the AUM in open-end mutual funds having
	an overall rating from Morningstar, Inc. ("Morningstar") 89% were ranked "three
	stars" or better, with approximately 59% ranked "five stars" or "four stars"
	on
	an overall basis (i.e

	.

	, derived from a weighted average of the
	performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year Morningstar
	Rating metrics).  There can be no assurance, however, that these funds
	will be able to maintain such ratings or that past performance will be
	indicative of future results.





	At
	December 31, 2006, approximately 37% of our assets under
	management in open-end, equity mutual funds had been obtained through direct
	sales relationships. We also sell our open-end mutual funds through Third-Party
	Distribution Programs, particularly No-Transaction Fee (“NTF”) Programs, and
	have developed additional classes of shares for many of our mutual funds for
	sale through additional third-party distribution channels on a commission
	basis.  At December 31, 2006, Third Party Distribution Programs
	accounted for approximately 63% of all assets in open-end funds.






	Closed-end
	Funds






	We
	act as investment advisor to seven closed-end funds, five of which
	trade on the NYSE: Gabelli Equity Trust (GAB), Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust
	(GGT), Gabelli Convertible and Income Securities Fund (GCV), Gabelli Utility
	Trust (GUT) and Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust (GDV) and two that trade on
	the American Stock Exchange (“AMEX”): Gabelli Global Utility & Income Trust
	(GLU) and Gabelli Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust (GGN). As of
	December 31, 2006, the seven Gabelli closed-end funds had record breaking total
	assets of $5.8 billion, representing 38.9% of the total assets in our Mutual
	Funds business.





	The
	Gabelli Equity Trust, which raised $400 million through its
	initial public offering in August 1986, finished its 20

	th

	year with
	net assets of $2.1 billion.  In September 2005, the Equity Trust
	completed its first acquisition of the assets of another closed-end investment
	company, Sterling Capital Corporation, with total assets of $18.3
	million.  In October 2005, the Equity Trust completed a heavily
	over-subscribed rights offering, retaining gross proceeds of $143.7
	million.  Since inception, the Equity Trust has distributed $1.953
	billion in cash to common shareholders through its 10% Distribution Policy
	and
	has spun off two other closed-end funds, the Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust
	and
	the Gabelli Utility Trust. In 2006, the Equity Trust also received net proceeds
	of $144.8 million of assets attributable to the 6.20% Series F Preferred
	Stock.





	The
	Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust, launched in November
	2003, raised $196.6 million in net proceeds through its placement of Series
	D
	and Series E Preferred Shares in November 2005.  The Gabelli Dividend
	& Income Trust, which invests primarily in dividend-paying equity
	securities, had a total annualized return of 14.1% since inception and net
	assets of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2006.





	The
	Gabelli Global Gold, Natural Resources & Income Trust
	raised gross proceeds of $332 million through its initial public offering in
	March 2005 and $20 million through the exercise of the underwriters’
	overallotment option in May 2005.  The Gabelli Global Gold, Natural
	Resources & Income Trust, which invests primarily in equity securities of
	gold and natural resources companies and utilizes a covered call option writing
	program to generate current income, had a total annualized return of 23.2%
	since
	inception and net assets of $432 million as of December 31, 2006. The Fund’s
	total return for 2006 was 18.2% and 23.3% since inception on March 31,
	2005.





	In
	January 2007, we launched the Gabelli Global Deal Fund (NYSE:
	GDL), a closed-end fund which will seek to achieve its investment objective
	by
	investing primarily in announced merger and acquisition transactions and, to
	a
	lesser extent, in corporate reorganizations involving stubs, spin-offs and
	liquidations. 





	A
	detailed description of our Mutual Funds is provided within this
	Item 1 beginning on page 18.

	Investment
	Partnerships:


	  We
	manage Investment Partnerships through our 92% majority-owned subsidiary,
	Gabelli Securities, Inc. ("GSI"). The Investment Partnerships consist primarily
	of limited partnerships, offshore funds, separate accounts and sub-advisory
	relationships within the following investment strategies: merger arbitrage,
	event-driven long/short equity funds, sector-focused funds and merchant banking.
	We had $491 million of Investment Partnership assets under management.





	We
	introduced our first investment partnership, a merger arbitrage
	partnership in 1985.  An offshore version of this strategy was added
	in 1989.  Building on our strengths in global event-driven value
	investing, several new Investment Partnerships have been added to balance
	investors’ geographic, strategy and sector needs.  Today we offer a
	broad range of absolute return products. Within our merger arbitrage strategy,
	we manage approximately $371 million of assets for investors who seek positive
	returns not correlated to fluctuations of the general market. These funds seek
	to drive returns by investing in announced merger and acquisition transactions
	that are primarily dependent on the deal closure and less on the overall market
	environment.  In event-driven strategies, we manage $78 million of
	assets focused on the U.S., Japanese, and European markets.  We also
	manage a series of sector-focused absolute return funds designed to offer
	investors a mechanism to diversify their portfolios by global economic sector
	rather than by geographic region.  We currently offer four
	sector-focused portfolios: the Gabelli International Gold Fund Ltd., GAMA Select
	Energy Plus, L.P., GAMCO Telecom Plus, L.P., and GAMCO Medical Opportunities,
	L.P.   Merchant banking activities are carried out through ALCE
	Partners, L.P. and Gabelli Multimedia Partners, L.P., both of which are closed
	to new investors. In 2006, in response to SEC registration proposals, GSI
	registered as an investment advisor for all of the investment partnerships
	and
	long/short portfolios.





	Our
	Investment Partnerships have been marketed primarily by our
	direct sales force to high net worth individuals and
	institutions.  Separate accounts and sub-advisory relationships
	continue to be an important aspect of our Investment Partnerships business
	and
	account for approximately 6% of our Investment Partnership assets under
	management.  We intend to expand product offerings, both domestic and
	international, and the geographic composition of our customer base in Investment
	Partnerships.  It is our expectation that the assets invested in these
	products will provide a growing source of revenues in the future.

	In
	2006, we continued to develop the skills of our investment team by
	allocating firm capital to incubate investment strategies. This began with
	a
	capital structure arbitrage strategy (2004) and now includes a merger-arbitrage,
	a global trading strategy as well as investment accounts for a designated group
	of analysts.






	Additional
	Information on Mutual Funds






	The
	Mutual Funds include twenty-six open-end mutual funds and seven
	closed-end funds which had total assets as of December 31, 2006 of $14.9
	billion. The open-end Mutual Funds are available to individuals and institutions
	on both a no-load and commission basis, while the closed-end funds are listed
	and traded on either the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) or the
	AMEX.  At December 31, 2006, the open-end funds had total net assets
	of $9.1 billion and the closed-end funds had total net assets of $5.8 billion.
	The assets managed in the closed-end funds represent approximately 39% of the
	assets in the Mutual Funds group and 21% of the total assets under management
	at
	December 31, 2006. Our assets under management consist of a broad range of
	U.S.
	and international stock, bond and money market mutual funds that meet the varied
	needs and objectives of our Mutual Fund shareholders. At December 31, 2006,
	approximately 37% of our assets under management in open-end Mutual Funds had
	been obtained through direct sales relationships.





	Through
	our affiliates, we act as advisor to all of the Mutual Funds,
	except with respect to the Gabelli Capital Asset Fund for which we act as a
	sub-advisor and Guardian Investment Services Corporation, an unaffiliated
	company, acts as manager. As sub-advisor, we make day-to-day investment
	decisions for the $234 million Gabelli Capital Asset Fund.





	Gabelli
	Funds, LLC (“Funds Advisor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
	GAMCO Investors, Inc., acts as the investment advisor for all of the Mutual
	Funds other than the Westwood family of funds.





	Gabelli
	Advisers, Inc., a subsidiary controlled by GAMCO Investors,
	Inc., acts as investment advisor to the Westwood family of funds and has
	retained Westwood Management Corporation, a New York Stock Exchange listed
	company (NYSE: WHG), to act as sub-advisor for five of the six portfolios.
	The
	Westwood Mighty Mites

	SM

	Fund, launched in May 1998, is advised solely
	by Gabelli Advisers, Inc., using a team investment approach. Westwood Management
	Corporation owns an approximately 19.0% equity interest in Gabelli Advisers,
	Inc.

	Morningstar
	Rating

	TM

	as of December 31, 2006. For
	each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates
	a
	Morningstar Rating

	TM

	based on a Morningstar risk-adjusted
	return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance
	(including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees)
	placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent
	performance.  The top 10% of the funds in an investment category
	receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35%
	receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom
	10%
	receive one star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is
	derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated
	with
	its three, five, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
	metrics.  Morningstar Ratings are shown for the respective class
	shown; other classes may have different performance
	characteristics.  There were 334 Conservative Allocation funds
	rated for three years, 178 funds for five years and 95 funds for
	ten years
	(GAMCO Mathers Fund).  There were 370 Mid-Cap Blend funds rated
	for three years, 304 funds for five years and 118 funds for ten years
	(The

	Fund).  There were 1,075 Large Value funds rated for three
	years, 812 funds for five years and 394 funds for ten years (The
	Gabelli
	Blue Chip Value Fund, Westwood Equity Fund, The Gabelli Equity Income
	Fund).  There were 72 Convertibles funds rated for three years,
	61 funds for five years and 45 funds for ten years (The GAMCO Global
	Convertible Securities Fund).  There were 402 World Stock funds
	rated for three years, 316 funds for five years and 158 funds for
	ten
	years (The GAMCO Global Growth Fund, The GAMCO Global Opportunity
	Fund).  There were 40 Specialty-Communications funds rated for
	three years, 40 funds for five years and 11 funds for ten years (The
	GAMCO
	Global Telecommunications Fund).  There were 57
	Specialty-Precious Metals funds rated for three years, 44 funds for

	years and 30 funds for ten years (GAMCO Gold

	The

	Funds
	Advisor has reduced the Advisory fee from 1.00% to
	0.50% since April 1, 2002.  Gabelli & Company, Inc. waived
	receipt of the 12b-1 Plan distribution fees as of January 1, 2003,
	and on
	February 25, 2004, the Fund’s Board of Directors agreed with the Funds
	Advisor’s request to terminate the 12b-1
	Plan.













	(7)  




	Certain
	funds are not rated because they do not have a
	three-year history, or there are not enough similar funds in the
	category
	determined by Morningstar.













	(8)  




	Funds
	Advisor has an agreement in place to waive its
	advisory fee or reimburse expenses of the Fund to maintain fund expenses
	at a specified level for Class AAA shares; multi-class shares have
	separate limits as described in the Fund’s prospectus.  (The
	Gabelli Woodland Small Cap Value Fund – 2.00%; Westwood Income Fund –
	1.50%; The GAMCO Global Opportunity Fund – 2.00%; The GAMCO Global
	Convertible Securities Fund – 2.00%; Westwood SmallCap Equity Fund –
	1.50%; Westwood Intermediate Bond Fund – 1.00%; The Gabelli U.S. Treasury
	Money Market Fund –0.08% through September 30, 2007.  Such
	agreements are renewable annually).













	(9)  




	Funds
	Advisor has agreed to reduce its advisory fee on the
	liquidation value of preferred stock outstanding if certain performance
	levels are not met.













	(10)  




	The
	Gabelli U.S. Treasury Money Market Fund, as a direct
	result of having the lowest expense ratio out of 42 funds, had the
	highest
	yield for the year ended December 31, 2006 of the 42 funds ranked
	by the
	iMoney Net Money Fund Report, in the 100% U.S. Treasury category.
	Longer
	term, the Fund has equally impressive results, ranking 2nd out of
	41 funds
	for 1 year, 3rd out of 28 funds for 5 years, and 3rd out of 24 funds
	for
	10 years, all periods ended December 31, 2006. Investment returns
	and
	yield will fluctuate. An investment in a money market fund is not
	guaranteed by the United States government nor insured by the Federal
	Deposit Insurance Corporation or any government agency. Although
	the Fund
	seeks to preserve the value of an investment at $1.00 per share,
	it is
	possible to lose money by investing on the
	Fund.

	Shareholders
	of the open-end Funds are allowed to exchange shares
	among the same class of shares of the other open-end funds as economic and
	market conditions and investor needs change at no additional
	cost.  However, as noted below, certain Mutual Funds impose a 2%
	redemption fee on shares redeemed in seven days or less after a purchase. We
	periodically introduce new mutual funds designed to complement and expand our
	investment product offerings, respond to competitive developments in the
	financial marketplace and meet the changing needs of investors.





	On
	December 30, 2004, the shareholders of The Gabelli ABC Fund voted
	to approve a charter amendment that would require investment accounts held
	at
	the fund's transfer agent, State Street Bank & Trust Company, be directly
	registered to the beneficial owners of the fund.  The action, which
	was recommended by Gabelli Funds, LLC (“Funds Advisor”) and approved by the
	fund’s Board of Directors, permits the redemption of shares held through certain
	brokers and financial consultants in omnibus and individual accounts where
	the
	beneficial owner is not disclosed.





	In
	January 2006, Funds Advisor announced that the Board of Trustees
	of the Ned Davis Research Funds voted to liquidate the Ned Davis Research Asset
	Allocation Fund and distribute the assets to shareholders. The Board agreed
	that
	liquidating the Fund, which was launched on March 31, 2003, was in the best
	interests of shareholders given its asset level, ongoing transactional and
	operating costs, and limited marketability.  The liquidation took
	place on February 10, 2006.





	Our
	marketing efforts for the Mutual Funds are currently focused on
	increasing the distribution and sales of our existing funds as well as creating
	new products for sale through our distribution channels. We believe that our
	marketing efforts for the Mutual Funds will continue to generate additional
	revenues from investment advisory fees. We have traditionally distributed most
	of our open-end Mutual Funds by using a variety of direct response marketing
	techniques, including telemarketing and advertising, and as a result we maintain
	direct relationships with many of our no-load open-end Mutual Fund customers.
	Beginning in late 1995, we expanded our product distribution by offering several
	of our open-end Mutual Funds through Third-Party Distribution Programs,
	including NTF Programs. In 1998 and 1999, we further expanded these efforts
	to
	include substantially all of our open-end Mutual Funds in Third-Party
	Distribution Programs. More than 37% of the assets under management in the
	open-end Mutual Funds are still attributable to our direct response marketing
	efforts. Third-Party Distribution Programs have become an increasingly important
	source of asset growth for us.  Of the $8.4 billion of assets under
	management in the open-end equity Mutual Funds as of December 31, 2006,
	approximately 63% were generated through Third-Party Distribution
	Programs.  We are responsible for paying the service and distribution
	fees charged by many of the Third-Party Distribution Programs, although a
	portion of such service fees under certain circumstances are payable by the
	funds.  Several bills have been introduced in Congress that would
	amend the Investment Company Act.  These proposals, which include but
	are not limited to the elimination or restriction of Rule 12b-1 distribution
	fees, if enacted or adopted, could have a substantial impact on the regulation
	and operation of our registered funds.  In light of such legislation
	and efforts by some of the program sponsors to increase fees beyond what we
	deem
	to be acceptable, several of our Mutual Funds may be withdrawn from such
	programs.  During 2000, we completed development of additional classes
	of shares for many of our mutual funds for sale through national brokerage
	and
	investment firms and other third-party distribution channels on a commission
	basis.  The multi-class shares are available in all of Gabelli mutual
	funds except The Gabelli ABC Fund, Gabelli Capital Asset Fund and the GAMCO
	Mathers Fund, although The Gabelli ABC Fund is planning on offering another
	class of shares.  The use of multi-class share products will expand
	the distribution of Gabelli Fund products into the advised sector of the mutual
	fund investment community.  During 2003, we introduced Class I shares,
	which are no load shares with higher minimum initial investment and without
	distribution fees available to Institutional and Retirement Plan Accounts
	directly through Gabelli & Company, Inc. The no-load shares are designated
	as Class AAA shares and are available for new and current
	investors.  Effective February 15, 2007, Class AAA shares of the GAMCO
	Growth Fund, GAMCO International Growth Fund, and GAMCO Global Growth Fund
	are
	only available to existing Gabelli Fund Shareholders who established accounts
	prior to February 15, 2007. In general, distribution through Third-Party
	Distribution Programs has greater variable cost components and lower fixed
	cost
	components than distribution through our traditional direct sales methods.





	We
	provide investment advisory and management services pursuant to an
	investment management agreement with each Mutual Fund. The investment management
	agreements with the Mutual Funds generally provide that we are responsible
	for
	the overall investment and administrative services, subject to the oversight
	of
	each Mutual Fund's Board of Directors or Trustees and in accordance with each
	Mutual Fund's fundamental investment objectives and policies. The investment
	management agreements permit us to enter into separate agreements for
	administrative and accounting services on behalf of the respective Mutual
	Funds.








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	25




















	We
	provide the Mutual Funds with administrative services pursuant to
	the management contracts.  Such services include, without limitation,
	supervision of the calculation of net asset value, preparation of financial
	reports for shareholders of the Mutual Funds, internal accounting, tax
	accounting and reporting, regulatory filings and other services. Most of these
	administrative services are provided through sub-contracts with unaffiliated
	third parties. Transfer agency and custodial services are provided directly
	to
	the Mutual Funds by unaffiliated third parties.





	Our
	Mutual Fund investment management agreements may continue in
	effect from year to year only if specifically approved at least annually by
	(i)
	the Mutual Fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii) the Mutual Fund's
	shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority of the Mutual Fund's
	directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement or "interested
	persons" of any such party, within the meaning of the Investment Company Act
	of
	1940 as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Each Mutual Fund may terminate
	its investment management agreement at any time upon 60 days' written notice
	by
	(i) a vote of the majority of the Board of Directors or Trustees cast in person
	at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a
	vote
	at a meeting of shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares
	represented in person or by proxy or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of
	such Mutual Fund. Each investment management agreement automatically terminates
	in the event of its assignment, as defined in the Investment Company
	Act.  We may terminate an investment management agreement without
	penalty on 60 days' written notice.






	Mutual
	Fund Distribution, Institutional Research, Brokerage
	and Underwriting






	Gabelli
	&
	Company,
	Inc. ("Gabelli & Company"), the
	wholly-owned subsidiary of our 92% majority-owned subsidiary Gabelli Securities,
	Inc., is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
	and a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
	(“NASD”).  Gabelli & Company's revenues are derived primarily from
	the distribution of our Mutual Funds, brokerage commissions, underwriting fees
	and selling concessions.







	Mutual
	Fund Distribution







	Gabelli
	&
	Company
	distributes our open-end Mutual Funds pursuant
	to distribution agreements with each Mutual Fund. Under each distribution
	agreement with an open-end Mutual Fund, Gabelli & Company offers and sells
	such open-end Mutual Fund's shares on a continuous basis and pays all of the
	costs of marketing and selling the shares, including printing and mailing
	prospectuses and sales literature, advertising and maintaining sales and
	customer service personnel and sales and services fulfillment systems, and
	payments to the sponsors of Third-Party Distribution Programs, financial
	intermediaries and Gabelli & Company sales personnel.  Gabelli
	& Company receives fees for such services pursuant to distribution plans
	adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 (“12b-1”) of the Investment Company Act.
	Distribution fees from the open-end Mutual Funds amounted to $18.9 million,
	$19.4 million and $20.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005
	and
	2006, respectively. Gabelli & Company is the principal underwriter for funds
	distributed in multiple classes of shares which carry either a front-end or
	back-end sales charge.  Underwriting fees and sales charges retained
	amounted to $346,000, $646,000 and $859,000 for the years ended December 31,
	2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively.





	Under
	the distribution plans, the open-end Class AAA shares of the
	Mutual Funds (except The Gabelli US Treasury Money Market Fund, Gabelli Capital
	Asset Fund and The Gabelli ABC Fund) and the Class A shares of various funds
	pay
	Gabelli & Company a distribution or service fee of .25% per year (except the
	Class A shares of the Westwood Funds which pay .50% per year) on the average
	daily net assets of the fund. Class B and Class C shares have a 12b-1
	distribution plan with a service and distribution fee totaling
	1%.  Gabelli & Company’s distribution agreements with the Mutual
	Funds may continue in effect from year to year only if specifically approved
	at
	least annually by (i) the Mutual Fund's Board of Directors or Trustees or (ii)
	the Mutual Fund's shareholders and, in either case, the vote of a majority
	of
	the Mutual Fund's directors or trustees who are not parties to the agreement
	or
	"interested persons" of any such party, within the meaning of the Investment
	Company Act. Each Mutual Fund may terminate its distribution agreement, or
	any
	agreement thereunder, at any time upon 60 days' written notice by (i) a vote
	of
	the majority of its directors or trustees cast in person at a meeting called
	for
	the purpose of voting on such termination or (ii) a vote at a meeting of
	shareholders of the lesser of either 67% of the voting shares represented in
	person or by proxy or 50% of the outstanding voting shares of such Mutual Fund.
	Each distribution agreement automatically terminates in the event of its
	assignment, as defined in the Investment Company Act.  Gabelli &
	Company may terminate a distribution agreement without penalty upon 60 days'
	written notice.

	Gabelli
	&
	Company
	provides institutional investors with
	investment ideas on numerous industries and special situations, with a
	particular focus on small-cap and mid-cap companies.  Our team of

	Brokerage
	Commissions and Trading







	Gabelli
	&
	Company
	generates brokerage commission revenues from
	securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of our mutual
	funds, institutional and high net worth clients as well as from retail
	customers.  Commission revenues totaled $15.6 million, $12.2 million,
	and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006,
	respectively. Gabelli & Company has considered and continues to explore
	expansion of its proprietary trading activities.







	Underwriting







	Gabelli
	&
	Company
	is involved in external syndicated underwriting
	activities.  In 2004, 2005 and 2006, Gabelli & Company
	participated in 5, 4 and 4 syndicated underwritings, respectively, of public
	equity and debt offerings managed by major investment banks with commitments
	of
	$32.1 million, $21.4 million and $15.5 million, respectively. In January 2007,
	Gabelli & Company participated in an underwriting syndicate of the initial
	public offering of the Gabelli Global Deal Fund (NYSE: GDL), a closed-end fund
	which will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing primarily
	in
	announced merger and acquisition transactions and, to a lesser extent, in
	corporate reorganizations involving stubs, spin-offs and
	liquidations. 






	Competition






	We
	compete with other investment management firms and mutual fund
	companies, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial
	institutions that offer products that have similar features and investment
	objectives to those offered by us.  Many of the investment management
	firms with which we compete are subsidiaries of large diversified financial
	companies and many others are much larger in terms of assets under management
	and revenues and, accordingly, have much larger sales organizations and
	marketing budgets.  Historically, we have competed primarily on the
	basis of the long-term investment performance of many of our investment
	products.  However, we have taken steps to increase our distribution
	channels, brand name awareness and marketing efforts.





	The
	market for providing investment management services to
	institutional and high net worth Separate Accounts is also highly competitive.
	Approximately 36% of our investment advisory fee revenue for the year ended
	December 31, 2006 was derived from our Separate Accounts.  Selection
	of investment advisors by U.S. institutional investors is often subject to
	a
	screening process and to favorable recommendations by investment industry
	consultants.  Many of these investors require their investment
	advisors to have a successful and sustained performance record, often five
	years
	or longer, and also focus on one-year and three-year performance
	records.  We have significantly increased our assets under management
	on behalf of U.S. institutional investors since our entry into the institutional
	asset management business in 1977. At the current time, we believe that our
	investment performance record would be attractive to potential new institutional
	and high net worth clients.  However, no assurance can be given that
	our efforts to obtain new business will be successful.

	Intellectual

	Service
	marks and brand name recognition are important to our
	business. We have rights to the service marks under which our products are
	offered.  We have registered certain service marks in the United
	States and will continue to do so as new trademarks and service marks are
	developed or acquired.  We have rights to use the “Gabelli” name, the
	“GAMCO” name, and other names.  Pursuant to an assignment agreement,
	Mr. Gabelli has assigned to us all of his rights, title and interests in and
	to
	the “Gabelli” name for use in connection with investment management services,
	mutual funds and securities brokerage services. However, under the agreement,
	Mr. Gabelli will retain any and all rights, title and interests he has or may
	have in the “Gabelli” name for use in connection with (i) charitable foundations
	controlled by Mr. Gabelli or members of his family or (ii) entities engaged
	in
	private investment activities for Mr. Gabelli or members of his family. In
	addition, the funds managed by Mr. Gabelli outside GBL have entered into a
	license agreement with us permitting them to continue limited use of the
	“Gabelli” name under specified circumstances. We have taken, and will continue
	to take, action to protect our interests in these service marks.






	Regulation






	Virtually
	all aspects of our businesses are subject to various
	federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily
	intended to protect investment advisory clients and shareholders of registered
	investment companies. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate
	investment advisors and broker-dealers such as us have broad administrative
	powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit such an advisor
	or
	broker-dealer from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply
	with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that
	may
	be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on
	engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation
	of investment advisor and other registrations, censures, and fines. We believe
	that we are in substantial compliance with all material laws and
	regulations.





	Our
	business is subject to regulation at both the federal and state
	level by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”) and
	other regulatory bodies. Certain of our subsidiaries are registered with the
	Commission under the Investment Advisers Act, and the Mutual Funds are
	registered with the Commission under the Investment Company Act. We also have
	a
	subsidiary that is registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission and is
	subject to regulation by the NASD and various states.





	The
	subsidiaries of GBL that are registered with the Commission under
	the Investment Advisers Act (Gabelli Funds LLC, Gabelli Advisers, Inc., Gabelli
	Fixed Income LLC, GAMCO Asset Management Inc. and Gabelli Securities, Inc.)
	are
	regulated by and subject to examination by the Commission. The Investment
	Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisors
	including fiduciary duties, record keeping requirements, operational
	requirements, marketing requirements and disclosure obligations. The Commission
	is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations
	of
	the Investment Advisers Act, ranging from censure to termination of an
	investment advisor's registration. The failure of a subsidiary to comply with
	the requirements of the Commission could have a material adverse effect on
	us.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the
	requirements of the regulations under the Investment Advisers Act.





	We
	derive a substantial majority of our revenues from investment
	advisory services through our investment management agreements. Under the
	Investment Advisers Act, our investment management agreements terminate
	automatically if assigned without the client's consent. Under the Investment
	Company Act, advisory agreements with registered investment companies such
	as
	the Mutual Funds terminate automatically upon assignment. The term "assignment"
	is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that
	may be deemed to occur, under certain circumstances, upon the transfer, directly
	or indirectly, of a controlling interest in GBL.





	In
	its capacity as a broker-dealer, Gabelli & Company, Inc. is
	required to maintain certain minimum net capital and cash reserves for the
	benefit of our customers. Gabelli & Company, Inc.’s net capital, as defined,
	has consistently met or exceeded all minimum requirements.  Gabelli
	& Company, Inc. is also subject to periodic examination by the NASD.





	Subsidiaries
	of GBL are subject to the Employee Retirement Income
	Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated there
	under, insofar as they are “fiduciaries” under ERISA with respect to certain of
	their clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
	of
	1986, as amended (the “Code”), impose certain duties on persons who are
	fiduciaries under ERISA and prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan
	clients. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material
	adverse effect on us.








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	28




















	Investments
	by GBL on behalf of our clients often represent a
	significant equity ownership position in an issuer's class of stock. As of
	December 31, 2006, we had five percent or more beneficial ownership with respect
	to approximately 110 equity securities. This activity raises frequent regulatory
	and legal issues regarding our aggregate beneficial ownership level with respect
	to portfolio securities, including issues relating to issuers' shareholder
	rights plans or “poison pills,” state gaming laws and regulations, federal
	communications laws and regulations, public utility holding company laws and
	regulations, federal proxy rules governing shareholder communications and
	federal laws and regulations regarding the reporting of beneficial ownership
	positions.  Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a
	material adverse effect on us.





	The
	USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the terrorist
	attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial
	transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations
	applicable to broker-dealers, mutual funds and other financial services
	companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account
	opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious
	activities.  Anti-money-laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain
	some similar provisions.  Our failure to comply with these
	requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.





	We
	and certain of our affiliates are subject to the laws of non-U.S.
	jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or bodies. In particular, we
	are
	subject to requirements in numerous jurisdictions regarding reporting of
	beneficial ownership positions in securities issued by companies whose
	securities are publicly-traded in those countries. In addition, GAMCO is
	registered as an international advisor, investment counsel and portfolio manager
	with the Ontario Securities Commission in Canada in order to market our services
	to prospective clients who reside in Ontario.  Several of our
	Investment Partnerships are organized under the laws of foreign jurisdictions.
	In connection with our opening of an office in London and our plans to market
	certain products in Europe, we are required to comply with the laws of the
	United Kingdom and other European countries regarding these
	activities.  Our subsidiary, GAMCO Asset Management (UK) Limited, is
	regulated by the Financial Services Authority.  In connection with our
	registration in the United Kingdom, we have minimum capital requirements that
	have been consistently met or exceeded.







	Recent
	regulatory developments







	On
	September 3, 2003, the New York Attorney General’s office (“NYAG”)
	announced that it had found evidence of widespread improper trading involving
	mutual fund shares.  These transactions included the “late trading” of
	mutual fund shares after the 4:00 p.m. pricing cutoff and “time zone arbitrage”
	of mutual fund shares designed to exploit pricing
	inefficiencies.  Since the NYAG’s announcement, the NASD, the SEC, the
	NYAG and officials of other states have been conducting inquiries into and
	bringing enforcement actions related to trading abuses in mutual fund
	shares.  We have received information requests and subpoenas from the
	SEC and the NYAG in connection with their inquiries and have been complying
	with
	these requests for documents and testimony. We implemented additional compliance
	policies and procedures in response to recent industry initiatives and an
	internal review of our mutual fund practices and procedures in a variety of
	areas.  A special committee of all of our independent directors was
	also formed to review various issues involving mutual fund share transactions
	and was assisted by independent counsel.





	As
	part of our review, hundreds of documents were examined and
	approximately fifteen individuals were interviewed.  We have found no
	evidence that any employee participated in or facilitated any “late
	trading”.  We also have found no evidence of any improper trading in
	our mutual funds by our investment professionals or senior
	executives.  As we previously reported, we did find that in August of
	2002, we banned an account, which had been engaging in frequent trading in
	our
	Global Growth Fund (the prospectus of which did not impose limits on frequent
	trading) and which had made a small investment in one of our hedge funds, from
	further transactions with our firm. Certain other investors had been banned
	prior to that.  We also found that certain discussions took place in
	2002 and 2003 between GBL’s staff and personnel of an investment advisor
	regarding possible frequent trading in certain Gabelli domestic equity funds.
	In
	June 2006, we began discussions with the SEC staff for a potential resolution
	of
	their inquiry.  As a result of these discussions, GBL recorded a
	reserve of approximately $12 million in the second quarter of
	2006.  In February 2007, one of our advisory subsidiaries made an
	offer of settlement to the SEC staff for communication to the Commission for
	its
	consideration to resolve this matter. This offer of settlement is subject to
	final agreement regarding the specific language of the SEC’s administrative
	order and other settlement documents. As a result of these developments, we
	increased our reserves as of the fourth quarter of 2006 by $3 million. Since
	these discussions are ongoing, we cannot determine at this time whether they
	will ultimately result in a settlement of this matter, whether our reserves
	will
	be sufficient to cover any payments by GBL related to such a settlement, or
	whether and to what extent insurance may cover such payments.








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	29




















	In
	September 2005, we were informed by the staff of the SEC that they
	may recommend to the Commission that one of our advisory subsidiaries be held
	accountable for the actions of two of the closed-end funds managed by the
	subsidiary relating to Section 19(a) and Rule 19a-1 of the Investment Company
	Act of 1940.  These provisions require registered investment companies
	to provide written statements to shareholders when a dividend is made from
	a
	source other than net investment income.  While the funds sent annual
	statements containing the required information and 1099 statements as required
	by the IRS, the funds did not send written statements to shareholders with
	each
	distribution in 2002 and 2003.  The staff indicated that they may
	recommend to the Commission that administrative remedies be sought, including
	a
	monetary penalty. The closed-end funds changed their notification procedures,
	and we believe that all of the funds are now in compliance.





	In
	response to industry-wide inquiries and enforcement actions, a
	number of regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced.  The
	SEC has proposed and adopted a number of rules under the Investment Company
	Act
	and the Investment Advisers Act and is currently studying potential major
	revisions of other rules.  The SEC adopted rules requiring written
	compliance programs for registered investment advisors and registered investment
	companies and additional disclosures regarding portfolio management and advisory
	contract renewals.  In addition, several bills were introduced in a
	prior Congress that, if adopted, would have amended the Investment Company
	Act.  These proposals, if reintroduced and enacted, or if adopted by
	the SEC, could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of
	our
	registered and unregistered funds.  For example, certain of these
	proposals would, among other things, limit or eliminate Rule 12b-1 distribution
	fees, limit or prohibit third party soft dollar arrangements and restrict the
	management of hedge funds and mutual funds by the same portfolio manager.





	The
	investment management industry is likely to continue facing a
	high level of regulatory scrutiny and become subject to additional rules
	designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls and reduce potential conflicts
	of interest.  In addition, the SEC has substantially increased its use
	of focused inquiries in which it requests information from a number of fund
	complexes regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities
	laws.  We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course
	of our business.  Changes in laws, regulations and administrative
	practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have
	increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material
	impact.






	Personnel






	On
	February 28, 2007, we had a full-time staff of approximately 200
	individuals, of whom 83 served in the portfolio management, research and trading
	areas, 61 served in the marketing and shareholder servicing areas and 56 served
	in the administrative area. As part of our staff, we employ 24 portfolio
	managers for the Mutual Funds, Separate Accounts and Investment
	Partnerships.

	We
	caution the reader that the following business risks and those
	risks described elsewhere in this report and in our other SEC filings could
	cause our actual results to differ materially from expectations stated in our
	forward-looking statements.


	 



	Risks
	Related to Our Industry



	 



	Changes
	in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could
	limit the sources and amounts of our revenues, increase our costs of doing
	business, decrease our profitability and materially and adversely affect our
	business.



	 


	Our
	business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States,
	primarily at the federal level, including regulation by the SEC under the
	Investment Company Act and the Investment Advisers Act, by the Department of
	Labor under the ERISA, as well as regulation by the NASD and state regulators.
	The mutual funds managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. are
	registered with the SEC as investment companies under the Investment Company
	Act. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on investment
	advisors, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements,
	disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment
	Company Act imposes similar obligations, as well as additional detailed
	operational requirements, on registered investment companies and investment
	advisors. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could result
	in fines, censure, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including
	revocation of our registration as an investment advisor or broker-dealer.
	Industry regulations are designed to protect our clients and investors in our
	funds and other third parties who deal with us and to ensure the integrity
	of
	the financial markets. They are not designed to protect our stockholders.
	Changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could limit the
	sources and amounts of our revenues, increase our costs of doing business,
	decrease our profitability and materially and adversely affect our
	business.


	 


	In
	response to scandals in the financial services industry regarding
	late trading, market timing and selective disclosure of portfolio information,
	various legislative and regulatory proposals are pending in or before, or have
	been adopted by, the U.S. Congress, the legislatures in states in which we
	conduct operations and the various regulatory agencies that supervise our
	operations, including the SEC. These proposals, to the extent enacted or
	adopted, could have a substantial impact on the regulation and operation of
	registered funds, investment advisors and broker-dealers and could adversely
	affect our assets under management, revenues and net income. Additionally,
	the
	SEC, the NASD and other regulators, as well as Congress, are investigating
	certain practices within our industry. These investigations could lead to
	further legislative and regulatory proposals that, if enacted or adopted, could
	adversely affect our business.


	 



	To
	the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price, we
	may not be able to maintain our current fee structure.



	 


	The
	investment management business is highly competitive and has
	relatively low barriers to entry. To the extent we are forced to compete on
	the
	basis of price, we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure.
	Although our investment management fees vary from product to product,
	historically we have competed primarily on the performance of our products
	and
	not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our
	competitors. In recent years, however, there has been a trend toward lower
	fees
	in the investment management industry. In order to maintain our fee structure
	in
	a competitive environment, we must be able to continue to provide clients with
	investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees.
	In
	addition, the board of directors of each mutual fund managed by Gabelli Funds,
	LLC and Gabelli Advisers, Inc. must make certain findings as to the
	reasonableness of its fees. We cannot be assured that we will succeed in
	providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our
	current fee structure. Fee reductions on existing or future new business could
	have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.


	 



	We
	derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts
	that may be terminated on short notice.



	 


	A
	substantial majority of all of our revenues are derived from
	investment management agreements and distribution
	arrangements.  Investment management agreements and distribution
	arrangements with the Mutual Funds are terminable without penalty on 60 days'
	notice (subject to certain additional procedural requirements in the case of
	termination by a Mutual Fund) and must be specifically approved at least
	annually, as required by law.  Such annual renewal requires, among
	other things, approval by the disinterested members of each Mutual Fund's board
	of directors or trustees.  Investment advisory agreements with the
	Separate Accounts are typically terminable by the client without penalty on
	30
	days' notice or less.  Any failure to renew or termination of a
	significant number of these agreements or arrangements would have a material
	adverse effect on us.


	 








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	31


















	Investors
	in the open-end funds can redeem their investments in
	these funds at any time without prior notice, which could adversely affect
	our
	earnings.



	 


	Open-end
	fund investors may redeem their investments in those funds
	at any time without prior notice. Investors may reduce the aggregate amount
	of
	assets under management for any number of reasons, including investment
	performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market
	performance. In a declining stock market, the pace of mutual fund redemptions
	could accelerate. Poor performance relative to other asset management firms
	tends to result in decreased purchases of mutual fund shares and increased
	redemptions of mutual fund shares. The redemption of investments in mutual
	funds
	managed by Gabelli Funds, LLC or Gabelli Advisers, Inc. would adversely affect
	our revenues, which are substantially dependent upon the assets under management
	in our funds. If redemptions of investments in mutual funds caused our revenues
	to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings.


	 



	Certain
	changes in control of our company would automatically
	terminate our investment management agreements with our clients, unless our
	separate account clients consent and, in the case of fund clients, the funds’
	boards of directors and shareholders vote to continue the agreements, and could
	prevent us for a two-year period from increasing the investment advisory fees
	we
	are able to charge our mutual fund clients.



	 



	Under
	the Investment Company Act, an investment management agreement
	with a fund must provide for its automatic termination in the event of its
	assignment. The fund’s board and shareholders must vote to continue the
	agreement following its assignment, the cost of which ordinarily would be
	borne
	by us.









	Under
	the Investment Advisers Act, a client’s investment management
	agreement may not be “assigned” by the investment advisor without the client’s
	consent. An investment management agreement is considered under both acts
	to be
	assigned to another party when a controlling block of the advisor’s securities
	is transferred. In our case, an assignment of our investment management
	agreements may occur if, among other things, we sell or issue a certain number
	of additional common shares in the future. We cannot be certain that our
	clients
	will consent to assignments of our investment management agreements or approve
	new agreements with us if an assignment occurs. Under the Investment Company
	Act, if a fund’s investment advisor engages in a transaction that results in the
	assignment of its investment management agreement with the fund, the advisor
	may
	not impose an “unfair burden” on that fund as a result of the transaction for a
	two-year period after the transaction is completed. The term “unfair burden” has
	been interpreted to include certain increases in investment advisory fees.
	This
	restriction may discourage potential purchasers from acquiring a controlling
	interest in our company.







	Regulatory
	developments designed to increase oversight of hedge
	funds may adversely affect our business.






	The
	SEC has proposed a rule that would limit the eligibility of
	individuals to invest in hedge funds by requiring that such individuals own
	not
	less than $2.5 million in investments at the time of their hedge fund
	investment. The SEC may also propose or enact other rules designed to increase
	oversight of hedge funds by the SEC. Any regulations applicable to hedge funds
	that may be adopted could have an impact on our operations and may adversely
	affect our hedge fund business and decrease our future income.


	 



	A
	decline in the prices of securities would lead to a decline in
	our assets under management, revenues and earnings.



	 


	Substantially
	all of our revenues are determined by the amount of our
	assets under management. Under our investment advisory contracts with our
	clients, the investment advisory fees we receive are typically based on the
	market value of assets under management. In addition, we receive asset-based
	distribution and/or service fees with respect to the open-end funds managed
	by
	Gabelli Funds, LLC or Gabelli Advisers, Inc. over time pursuant to distribution
	plans adopted under provisions of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company
	Act. Rule 12b-1 fees typically are based on the market value of assets
	under management and represented approximately 7.9% of our revenues for the
	year
	ended December 31, 2006 and 7.4% and 7.7% of our revenues for the years
	ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Accordingly, a decline in
	the prices of securities generally may cause our revenues and net income to
	decline by either causing the value of our assets under management to decrease,
	which would result in lower investment advisory and Rule 12b-1 fees, or
	causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments they perceive
	to
	offer greater opportunity or lower risk, which would also result in lower fees.
	The securities markets are highly volatile, and securities prices may increase
	or decrease for many reasons, including economic and political events and acts
	of terrorism beyond our control. If a decline in securities prices caused our
	revenues to decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our
	earnings.


	 








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	32


















	Catastrophic
	and unpredictable events could have a material
	adverse effect on our business.



	 


	A
	terrorist attack, war, power failure, cyber-attack, natural
	disaster or other catastrophic or unpredictable event could adversely affect
	our
	future revenues, expenses and earnings by: interrupting our normal business
	operations; sustaining employee casualties, including loss of our key
	executives; requiring substantial expenditures and expenses to repair, replace
	and restore normal business operations; and reducing investor confidence.


	 


	We
	have a disaster recovery plan to address certain contingencies,
	but we cannot be assured that this plan will be sufficient in responding or
	ameliorating the effects of all disaster scenarios. If our employees or vendors
	we rely upon for support in a catastrophic event are unable to respond
	adequately or in a timely manner, we may lose clients resulting in a decrease
	in
	assets under management which may have a material adverse effect on revenues
	and
	net income.


	 



	Risks
	Related to Our Business



	 



	Control
	by Mr. Gabelli of a majority of the combined voting power
	of our common stock may give rise to conflicts of interests.



	 


	Since
	our initial public offering in 1999, Mr. Gabelli, through his
	majority ownership of GGCP, has beneficially owned a majority of our outstanding
	class B common stock. As of December 31, 2006, GGCP’s holdings of our class B
	common stock represent approximately 95% of the combined voting power of all
	classes of our voting stock.  As long as Mr. Gabelli indirectly
	beneficially owns a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock,
	he will have the ability to elect all of the members of our Board of Directors
	and thereby control our management and affairs, including determinations with
	respect to acquisitions, dispositions, borrowings, issuances of common stock
	or
	other securities, and the declaration and payment of dividends on the common
	stock.  In addition, Mr. Gabelli will be able to determine the outcome
	of matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders for approval and will be
	able
	to cause or prevent a change in control of our company.  As a result
	of Mr. Gabelli's control, none of our agreements with Mr. Gabelli and other
	companies controlled by him have been arrived at through "arm's-length"
	negotiations, although we believe that the parties endeavor to implement
	market-based terms.  There can be no assurance that we would not have
	received more favorable terms from an unaffiliated party.


	 


	In
	order to minimize conflicts and potential competition with our
	investment management business, in 1999 and as part of our initial public
	offering, Mr. Gabelli entered into a written agreement to limit his activities
	outside of GBL.  Mr. Gabelli has undertaken that so long as he is
	associated with GBL or for a period of five years from our initial public
	offering, whichever is longer, he will not provide investment management
	services for compensation other than in his capacity as an officer or employee
	of GBL except for (a) those investment funds and accounts managed by Mr. Gabelli
	outside the company under performance fee arrangements, but only to the extent
	that any such investment fund or account consists solely of one or more of
	the
	persons who were investors as of the date of the consummation of the initial
	public offering or such additional investors to the extent that all revenues
	attributable to such additional investors are paid to GBL, and (b) successor
	funds and accounts which serve no investors other than those in the funds and
	accounts referred to in (a) or those investors' successors, heirs, donees or
	immediate families, which funds and accounts operate according to an investment
	style similar to such other accounts or funds, which style we did not use at
	the
	time of our initial public offering, and which are subject to performance fee
	arrangements.  To the extent that such activities are not prohibited
	under this agreement, Mr. Gabelli intends to continue devoting time to
	activities outside GBL, including managing his own assets and his family's
	assets, managing or controlling companies in other industries and managing
	assets for other investors through the permissible accounts, which are the
	funds
	and accounts managed outside GBL that are permitted under the agreement between
	us and Mr. Gabelli (these assets were approximately $71.3 million in February
	1999 and approximately $97.3 million as the end of 2006).  These
	activities may present conflicts of interest or compete with GBL.  Our
	Certificate of Incorporation expressly provides in general that Mr. Gabelli,
	members of his immediate family who are officers or directors of GBL and
	entities controlled by such persons have an obligation to present corporate
	opportunities to us and resolve conflicts of interest through one of the
	processes described in the Certificate of Incorporation, which include
	independent director or independent shareholder approval.


	 


	We
	will not derive any income from activities outside GBL by Mr.
	Gabelli (except as described above) or members of his immediate family who
	are
	officers or directors of GBL and may not be able to take advantage of business
	and investment opportunities that could later prove to be beneficial to us
	and
	our shareholders, either because such opportunities were not GBL opportunities
	at the time they arose or because we did not pursue them.  Where a
	conflict of interest involves a transaction between Mr. Gabelli or members
	of
	his immediate family who are officers or directors of GBL or their affiliates
	and GBL, there can be no assurance that we would not receive more favorable
	terms if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party, although we will seek
	to
	achieve market-based terms in all such transactions.


	 








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	33


















	We
	depend on Mario J. Gabelli and other key personnel.



	 


	We
	are dependent on the efforts of Mr. Gabelli, our Chairman of the
	Board, Chief Executive Officer and the primary portfolio manager for a
	significant majority of our assets under management. The loss of Mr. Gabelli's
	services would have a material adverse effect on us.


	 


	In
	addition to Mr. Gabelli, our future success depends to a
	substantial degree on our ability to retain and attract other qualified
	personnel to conduct our investment management business.  The market
	for qualified portfolio managers is extremely competitive and has grown more
	so
	in recent periods as the investment management industry has experienced
	growth.  We anticipate that it will be necessary for us to add
	portfolio managers and investment analysts as we further diversify our
	investment products and strategies.  There can be no assurance,
	however, that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the
	required personnel.  In addition, our investment professionals and
	senior marketing personnel have direct contact with our Separate Account
	clients, which can lead to strong client relationships.  The loss of
	these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with certain Separate Account
	clients, and result in the loss of such accounts.  The loss of key
	management professionals or the inability to recruit and retain sufficient
	portfolio managers and marketing personnel could have a material adverse effect
	on our business.


	 



	Potential
	adverse effects on our performance prospects from a
	decline in the performance of the securities markets.



	 


	Our
	results of operations are affected by many economic factors,
	including the performance of the securities markets.  During the
	1990s, unusually favorable and sustained performance of the U.S. securities
	markets, and the U.S. equity market, in particular, attracted substantial
	inflows of new investments in these markets and has contributed to significant
	market appreciation which has, in turn, led to an increase in our assets under
	management and revenues.  At December 31, 2006, approximately 97% of
	our assets under management were invested in portfolios consisting primarily
	of
	equity securities.  More recently, the securities markets in general
	have experienced significant volatility, with declines in value experienced
	during the years 2001 and 2002, and increases in subsequent
	years.  Any decline in the securities markets, in general, and the
	equity markets, in particular, could reduce our assets under management and
	consequently reduce our revenues.  In addition, any such decline in
	the equity markets, failure of these markets to sustain their prior levels
	of
	growth, or continued short-term volatility in these markets could result in
	investors withdrawing from the equity markets or decreasing their rate of
	investment, either of which would be likely to adversely affect
	us.  From time to time, a relatively high proportion of the assets we
	manage may be concentrated in particular industry sectors.  A general
	decline in the performance of securities in those industry sectors could have
	an
	adverse effect on our assets under management and revenues.


	 



	Possibility
	of losses associated with proprietary investment
	activities.



	 


	We
	may from time to time make or maintain large proprietary
	investment positions in securities.  Market fluctuations and other
	factors may result in substantial losses in our proprietary accounts, which
	could have an adverse effect on our balance sheet, reduce our ability or
	willingness to make new investments or impair our credit ratings.


	 



	Future
	investment performance could reduce revenues and other
	income.



	 


	Success
	in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is
	dependent on investment performance as well as distribution and client
	servicing.  Good performance generally stimulates sales of our
	investment products and tends to keep withdrawals and redemptions low, which
	generates higher management fees (which are based on the amount of assets under
	management).  Conversely, relatively poor performance tends to result
	in decreased sales, increased withdrawals and redemptions in the case of the
	open-end Mutual Funds, and in the loss of Separate Accounts, with corresponding
	decreases in revenues to us.  Many analysts of the mutual fund
	industry believe that investment performance is the most important factor for
	the growth of open and closed-end funds, such as those we
	offer.  Failure of our investment products to perform well could,
	therefore, have a material adverse effect on us.


	 



	Loss
	of significant Separate Accounts could affect our
	revenues.



	 


	We
	had approximately 1,700 Separate Accounts as of December 31, 2006,
	of which the ten largest accounts generated approximately 8% of our total
	revenues during the year ended December 31, 2006.  Loss of these
	accounts for any reason would have an adverse effect on our
	revenues.  Notwithstanding performance, we have from time to time lost
	large Separate Accounts as a result of corporate mergers and restructurings,
	and
	we could continue to lose accounts under these or other circumstances.








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	34




















	During
	2006, as in prior years, we experienced client “turnover”.
	In the Separate Accounts, over one half of the decrease in assets were
	subadvisory assets where the advisor underwent a corporate change in control,
	such as, a spin-off from a parent organization or the sale of the advisor to
	a
	third party.






	A
	decline in the market for closed-end funds could reduce our
	ability to raise future assets to manage.






	Market
	conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we
	manage in closed-end mutual funds. A significant portion of our recent growth
	in
	the assets we manage has resulted from public offerings of the common and
	preferred shares of closed-end mutual funds. We have raised $1.2 billion in
	gross assets through closed-end fund offerings since January 2004. The market
	conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future, which
	could adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and our
	revenue.






	We
	rely on third-party distribution programs.



	 


	We
	have since 1996 experienced significant growth in sales of our
	open-end Mutual Funds through Third-Party Distribution Programs, which are
	programs sponsored by third-party intermediaries that offer their mutual fund
	customers a variety of competing products and administrative
	services.  Most of the sales growth from our Third-Party Distribution
	Programs is from programs with no transaction fees payable by the customer,
	which we refer to as NTF Programs.  Approximately $2.5 billion of our
	assets under management in the open-end Mutual Funds as of December 31, 2006
	were obtained through NTF Programs.  The cost of participating in
	Third-Party Distribution Programs is higher than our direct distribution costs,
	and it is anticipated that the cost of Third-Party Distribution Programs will
	increase in the future.  Any increase would be likely to have an
	adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations.  In
	addition, there can be no assurance that the Third-Party Distribution Programs
	will continue to distribute the Mutual Funds.  At December 31, 2006,
	approximately 88.7% of the NTF Program net assets in the Gabelli and Westwood
	families of funds are attributable to two NTF Programs.  The decision
	by these Third-Party Distribution Programs to discontinue distribution of the
	Mutual Funds, or a decision by us to withdraw one or more of the Mutual Funds
	from the programs, could have an adverse effect on our growth of assets under
	management.


	 



	Possibility
	of losses associated with underwriting, trading and
	market-making activities.



	 


	Our
	underwriting, trading and market-making activities are primarily
	conducted through our subsidiary, Gabelli & Company, Inc., both as principal
	and agent.  Such activities subject our capital to significant risks
	of loss.  The risks of loss include those resulting from ownership of
	securities, extension of credit, leverage, liquidity, counterparty failure
	to
	meet commitments, client fraud, employee errors, misconduct and fraud (including
	unauthorized transactions by traders), failures in connection with the
	processing of securities transactions and litigation.  We have
	procedures and internal controls to address such risks, but there can be no
	assurance that these procedures and controls will prevent losses from
	occurring.


	 



	We
	may have liability as a general partner or otherwise with
	respect to our alternative investment products.



	 


	Certain
	of our subsidiaries act as general partner for investment
	partnerships, including arbitrage, event-driven long/short, sector focused
	and
	merchant banking limited partnerships.  As a general partner of these
	partnerships, we may be held liable for the partnerships' liabilities in excess
	of their ability to pay such liabilities.  In addition, in certain
	circumstances, we may be liable as a control person for the acts of our
	investment partnerships.  As of December 31, 2006, our assets under
	management included approximately $491 million in investment
	partnerships.  A substantial adverse judgment or other liability with
	respect to our investment partnerships could have a material adverse effect
	on
	us.


	 



	Operational
	risks may disrupt our businesses, result in
	regulatory action against us or limit our growth.



	 


	We
	face operational risk arising from errors made in the execution,
	confirmation or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being
	properly recorded, evaluated or accounted for.  Our business is highly
	dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, transactions across
	markets in an efficient and accurate manner. Consequently, we rely heavily
	on
	our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. If any of these
	systems do not operate properly or are disabled, we could suffer financial
	loss,
	a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention
	or
	reputational damage.


	 








	      

	                  
	              

	    







	35


















	Dependence
	on information systems.



	 


	We
	operate in an industry that is highly dependent on its information
	systems and technology.  We outsource a significant portion of our
	information systems operations to third parties who are responsible for
	providing the management, maintenance and updating of such
	systems.  There can be no assurance, however, that our information
	systems and technology will continue to be able to accommodate our growth or
	that the cost of maintaining such outsourcing arrangements will not increase
	from its current level.  Such a failure to accommodate growth, or an
	increase in costs related to these information systems, could have a material
	adverse effect on us.


	 



	We
	may not be able to refinance or have the funds necessary to
	repurchase our existing indebtedness.



	 



	On
	August 10, 2001, we and certain of our affiliates entered into a
	note purchase agreement with Cascade Investment, L.L.C., pursuant to which
	Cascade purchased $100 million in principal amount of a convertible promissory
	note.  Pursuant to the terms of the note, Cascade may require us, or
	upon a change in control or Mr. Gabelli ceasing to provide our predominant
	executive leadership, to repurchase the note (i.e., put option) at par plus
	accrued and unpaid interest on the note.  In March 2005, we amended
	the terms of the note.  The new terms extended the exercise date of
	Cascade's put option to September 15, 2006, reduced the principal of the
	convertible note to $50 million, effective April 1, 2005, and removed
	limitations on the issuance of additional debt. In June 2006, GBL and Cascade
	agreed to amend the terms of the note.  Effective September 15, 2006,
	the rate on the note increased from 5% to 6% while the conversion price was
	raised to $53 per share from $52 per share.  In addition, the exercise
	date of Cascade’s put option was extended to May 15, 2007, the expiration date
	of the related letter of credit was extended to May 22, 2007 and a call option
	was included giving GBL the right to redeem the note at 101% of its principal
	amount together with all accrued but unpaid interest thereon upon at least
	30
	days prior written notice, subject to certain provisions.








	If
	Cascade exercises its right under the note to require us to
	repurchase the note, we may not be able to obtain new financing on similar
	terms
	to the note and may not have sufficient funds, or we may not be able to arrange
	financing on acceptable terms, to pay the repurchase price for the
	note.  If we could not obtain sufficient cash to repurchase the note,
	we would be in default on our obligation under the note purchase
	agreement.


	 



	Our
	credit ratings affect our borrowing costs.



	 


	Our
	borrowing costs and our access to the debt capital markets depend
	significantly on our credit ratings. A reduction in our credit ratings could
	increase our borrowing costs and limit our access to the capital markets.


	 



	We
	face exposure to litigation within our business.



	 


	The
	volume of litigation against financial services firms and the
	amount of damages claimed has increased over the past several
	years.  The types of claims that we may face are
	varied.  For example, we may face claims against us for purchasing
	securities that are inconsistent with a client’s investment objectives or
	guidelines, in connection with the operation of the Mutual Funds or arising
	from
	an employment dispute.  The risk of litigation is difficult to assess
	or quantify, and may occur years after the activities or events at
	issue.  Even if we prevail in a legal action brought against us, the
	costs alone of defending against the action could have a material adverse effect
	on us.


	 



	Compliance
	failures and changes in regulation could adversely
	affect us.



	 


	Our
	investment management activities are subject to client
	guidelines, and our Mutual Fund business involves compliance with numerous
	investment, asset valuation, distribution and tax requirements.  A
	failure to adhere to these guidelines or satisfy these requirements could result
	in losses which could be recovered by the client from us in certain
	circumstances.  Although we have installed procedures and utilize the
	services of experienced administrators, accountants and lawyers to assist us
	in
	adhering to these guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain
	insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no
	assurance that such precautions or insurance will protect us from potential
	liabilities.

	Our
	businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the United
	States, including by the SEC and the NASD.  We are also subject to the
	laws of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies or
	bodies.  Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations
	could result in fines, suspensions of personnel or other sanctions, including
	revocation of our registration or any of our subsidiaries as an investment
	advisor or broker-dealer.  Changes in laws or regulations or in
	governmental policies could have a material adverse effect on us.  The
	regulatory matters described in the “Recent Regulatory Developments” section
	above or other regulatory or compliance matters could also have a material
	adverse effect on us.


	 



	Our
	reputation is critical to our success.



	 


	Our
	reputation is critical to maintaining and developing
	relationships with our clients, Mutual Fund shareholders and third-party
	intermediaries.  In recent years, there have been a number of
	well-publicized cases involving fraud, conflicts of interest or other misconduct
	by individuals in the financial services industry.  Misconduct by our
	staff, or even unsubstantiated allegations, could result not only in direct
	financial harm but also harm to our reputation, causing injury to the value
	of
	our brands and our ability to retain or attract assets under
	management.  In addition, in certain circumstances, misconduct on the
	part of our clients or other parties could damage our
	reputation.  Harm to our reputation could have a material adverse
	effect on us.


	 



	We
	face strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger
	companies.



	 


	We
	compete with numerous investment management companies, stock
	brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, savings
	and
	loan associations and other financial institutions.  Continuing
	consolidation in the financial services industry has created stronger
	competitors with greater financial resources and broader distribution channels
	than our own.  Additionally, competing securities dealers whom we rely
	upon to distribute our mutual funds also sell their own proprietary funds and
	investment products, which could limit the distribution of our investment
	products.  To the extent that existing or potential customers,
	including securities dealers, decide to invest in or distribute the products
	of
	our competitors, the sales of our products as well as our market share, revenues
	and net income could decline.


	 



	Fee
	pressures could reduce our profit margins.



	 


	There
	has been a trend toward lower fees in some segments of the
	investment management industry.  In order for us to maintain our fee
	structure in a competitive environment, we must be able to provide clients
	with
	investment returns and service that will encourage them to be willing to pay
	such fees.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be
	able to maintain our current fee structure.  Fee reductions on
	existing or future new business could have an adverse impact on our profit
	margins and results of operations.


	 



	Risks
	Related to the Company



	 



	The
	disparity in the voting rights among the classes of shares
	may have a potential adverse effect on the price of our class A common
	stock.



	 


	The
	holders of class A common stock and class B common stock have
	identical rights except that (i) holders of class A common stock are entitled
	to
	one vote per share, while holders of class B common stock are entitled to ten
	votes per share on all matters to be voted on by shareholders in general, and
	(ii) holders of class A common stock are not eligible to vote on matters
	relating exclusively to class B common stock and vice versa.  The
	differential in voting rights and the ability of our company to issue additional
	class B common stock could adversely affect the value of the class A common
	stock to the extent the investors, or any potential future purchaser of our
	company, view the superior voting rights of the class B common stock to have
	value.


	 



	Future
	sales of our class A common stock in the public
	market or sales or distributions of our class B commons stock could lower our
	stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity
	or convertible securities may dilute our stockholders’ ownership in
	us.



	 


	We
	may sell additional shares of class A common stock in
	subsequent public offerings. We also may issue additional shares of class A
	common stock or convertible debt securities. As of December 31, 2006, we
	had 7,487,018 outstanding shares of class A common stock. On September 1,
	2006, a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 was declared effective by
	the
	SEC for the re-sale of up to 2,486,763 class A shares.

	No
	prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales
	or distributions of class B common stock owned by GGCP will have on the market
	price of the class A common stock prevailing from time to
	time.   Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of class A
	or class B common stock , or the perception that such sales or distributions
	could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price for the class
	A
	common stock.


	 



	We
	reported two material weaknesses in our internal controls over
	financial reporting in 2006.  Failure to properly remediate these
	material weaknesses could negatively impact our business and the price of our
	common stock.



	 


	We
	concluded that these material weaknesses existed in our internal
	control over financial reporting.  First, there was a material
	weakness relating to the reporting of individual assets and liabilities of
	certain proprietary investment accounts in the consolidated financial
	statements.  Next, there was a material weakness relating to the
	evaluation of and accounting for certain non-routine transactions in accordance
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	 


	We
	have remediated the first material weakness by implementing a new
	procedure to review the accounting treatment for all of the Company’s
	proprietary investments on a regular basis and are in the process of remediating
	the second material weakness.


	 


	We
	cannot assure you that our disclosure controls, procedures and
	internal controls over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act will prove to be adequate in the future. Our failure to
	properly remediate these material weaknesses could negatively impact our
	business and the price of our common stock.
