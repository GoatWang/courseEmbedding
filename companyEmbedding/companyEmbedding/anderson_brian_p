“Brian brings decades of audit and corporate governance expertise to the Board, as well as providing his unique perspective from the viewpoint of an experienced CFO,” said CAQ Governing Board Chair and Deloitte LLP CEO Cathy Engelbert.


Washington, DC (PRWEB)
October 27, 2016
 Brian P. Anderson, a corporate director, audit committee chair and former audit partner, has been named to the Center for Audit Quality’s (CAQ) Governing Board. Anderson fills the seat vacated by Michele J. Hooper, President and CEO of The Directors’ Council.
“Brian brings decades of audit and corporate governance expertise to the Board, as well as providing his unique perspective from the viewpoint of an experienced CFO,” said CAQ Governing Board Chair and Deloitte LLP CEO Cathy Engelbert. “I look forward to working with him to help promote the CAQ’s mission and to advance issues facing the future of the profession. Brian will be a valuable addition to the Governing Board and contribute to the CAQ’s dedication of enhancing investor confidence and public trust in the global capital markets.”
Anderson is a member of the Board of W.W. Grainger, Inc., a global broad line supplier of maintenance, repair, and operating products and services, and served as Lead Director from 2011 to 2014. Prior to becoming Lead Director, he served as W.W. Grainger’s Audit Committee Chair for 11 years. He has also chaired the audit committees of PulteGroup, Inc., a leading national homebuilding company, since 2005 and James Hardie Industries plc, a global manufacturer of fiber cement products, since 2006. He is the Chairman of the Nemours Foundation, a leading multi-state Pediatric Health Care System, and served as Non-Executive Independent Chairman of A. M. Castle & Company, a provider of metals, services, and supply chain solutions.
From 1998 to 2004, Anderson was Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Baxter International Inc., a global diversified medical products and services company. Earlier in his career, he was an Audit Partner with Deloitte & Touche LLP.
Anderson is a Certified Public Accountant who has a BBA from Howard University and an MBA in Finance and Accounting from Indiana University.
“Brian’s work inside the audit profession and as a corporate director and audit committee chair make him a valuable addition to the CAQ Governing Board,” said CAQ Executive Director Cindy Fornelli. “We welcome his experience and commitment to working with the public company auditing profession to enhance audit quality.”
"In an ever evolving business and policy environment, the public company auditing profession faces both challenges and opportunities," Anderson said. “I'm pleased to join the CAQ's Governing Board as it confronts these challenges and strives to enhance audit quality for the benefit of investors and our capital markets.”
Fornelli also thanked Michele Hooper for her nine years of service on the Board.
“Michele has made significant contributions to the CAQ Board during her tenure, leading initiatives to improve the detection and deterrence of financial reporting fraud and advocating for greater transparency for investors,” Fornelli said. “We thank Michele for her service to the CAQ and the audit profession and wish her the best in future endeavors.”
The CAQ Governing Board sets the policy agenda and provides strategic oversight for the organization. It is comprised of the chief executive officers from the world’s largest public company auditing firms and the American Institute of CPAs, as well as experts from the investor, academic, and issuer communities. Board members are committed to the concept that a robust public company auditing profession is fundamental to the capital markets.

Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Anderson, Brian P carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Anderson, Brian P currently holds license 19897 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Anderson, Brian P



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Anderson, Brian P



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Anderson, Brian P



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).
