Last December, when Joseph Lhota resigned as chairman of the Metropolitan Transit Authority to launch a mayoral bid, many business leaders indicated they'd take a wait-and-see approach to his underdog candidacy. "In a city that is [heavily] Democratic, at a minimum the business community will be hedging its bets," explained Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, an organization of the city's largest private employers. "It is still likely that the person who comes out of the Democratic primary will be the mayor." At the time, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn was perceived as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's business-friendly successor. But in last week's Democratic primary, Ms. Quinn placed a distant third, while the most liberal contender, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, outpaced the field. Former city Comptroller Bill Thompson, who like Ms. Quinn is perceived as business-friendly, finished a distant second and may not even qualify for a runoff with Mr. de Blasio.

The results raise the question of whether the business community will move behind Mr. Lhota, despite his odds in a city with six Democrats for every Republican. Mr. Lhota had raised a total of $2 million as of late August, compared with Mr. de Blasio's $4.4 million. But Mr. de Blasio's tax-and-spend pledges may change that. "The real estate industry and others in New York have to be noticing Bill de Blasio's rhetoric," said Republican consultant Bill O'Reilly. "There's no going back to the center from where he is."

Friends supply funds
So far, business interests have wagered more on Mr. de Blasio, whose major campaign contributors, such as the real estate and taxi industries, have financial stakes in city policy. Mr. Lhota's biggest fundraisers have been former Giuliani administration colleagues. Of the 11 bundlers who have raised more than $10,000 for him, six worked in the administration with Mr. Lhota, who was deputy mayor and budget director. Many of them retain ties to city government. Mr. Lhota's biggest campaign bundler is Robert Harding, an attorney who has raised more than $41,000, much of it from his politically prominent law firm, Greenberg Traurig. Mr. Harding is the son of the late Liberal Party head Raymond Harding, who had extremely close ties with Mr. Giuliani and later pleaded guilty to securities violations in 2009. The son's appointment as Mr. Giuliani's budget director in 1998 raised eyebrows because he had little experience managing fiscal matters. Other major Lhota bundlers from the Giuliani world include former Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro, a politically connected attorney who, in classic bet-hedging style, was also a major bundler for the Democratic Mr. Thompson; Agostino Cangemi, an assistant counsel in the Giuliani administration who is now a lobbyist; John Odermatt, a former commissioner of the Office of Emergency Management and now a managing director at Citigroup; and John Mascialino, a former official in the Department of Citywide Administrative Services and an attorney who now heads Greenberg Traurig's government and law policy practice. Mr. Lhota's post-Giuliani stint as an executive vice president of Cablevision is also proving helpful in his run for mayor. The company's president and CEO, James Dolan, has raised more than $19,000, while Richard Hochman, a business consultant who is Mr. Lhota's second-biggest fundraiser, has served on Cablevision's board of directors. Mr. Hochman said he does not have business before the city that would benefit from a Lhota administration. He gave to Mr. Lhota, he added, because of their personal relationship and because he believes the candidate would preserve the gains of the Bloomberg and Giuliani eras. "I grew up in this city," Mr. Hochman said. "I saw it in 1969, I saw it in the 1980s, and for the past 20 years, Giuliani and Bloomberg made it such a better place to live. I don't want to go back." Given Mr. de Blasio's momentum, Mr. Lhota must reach beyond his inner circle, perhaps even to disaffected supporters of Mr. de Blasio's vanquished Democratic rivals. During the Republican primary, billionaire opponent John Catsimatidis repeatedly said that Mr. Lhota could not compete in November because of a lack of resources. Mr. Bloomberg, running as a Republican and independent, spent more than $100 million to eke out a third term in 2009.

Billionaire steps up
Mr. Lhota is getting help from an outside group called New Yorkers for Proven Leadership, which was started by three former Giuliani aides. It has already received $290,000 from billionaire David Koch and his wife and is launching a national fundraising effort touting Mr. Lhota as a moderate Republican who can win in a deep-blue city. Like Mr. Lhota's campaign, the committee might struggle to get enough donations to make a major impact, as New York Republicans have in recent statewide elections. But a spokesman for the group, Michael McKeon, said he believed business supporters of Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson would now flock to Mr. Lhota. "I think people who supported the other candidates are now going to take a harder look at a guy who is the most liberal candidate and the farthest to the left," said Mr. McKeon. "They're going to take a hard look at de Blasio. And they're going to take a second look at Joe." That will be an uphill fight, as the vanquished Democrats have all pledged to support their party's nominee. A number of Democrats crossed party lines to support Mr. Bloomberg in his 2005 and 2009 re-election campaigns, but Mr. Lhota lacks several advantages that the mayor had: incumbency, weak competition and an unlimited campaign budget. Mr. Lhota's third-largest fundraiser, Joseph Dussich of JAD Corp. of America, stands out as the rare business-owning Lhota bundler whose company might benefit from a Lhota mayoralty. Mr. Dussich, a Queens building maintenance supplies dealer who had raised more than $32,000 through July, received a visit from Mr. Lhota in August during a tour of small businesses. Mr. Lhota touted the mint-scented trash bags sold by Mr. Dussich that can repel mice, raccoons and other critters. During the visit, Mr. Dussich, who did not return a request for comment, lamented that the Parks Department was rebuffing his efforts to sell the trash bags to the city. Mr. Lhota called it the type of product that could keep manufacturing jobs in the city. "Of course you can, if you put your mind to it," Mr. Lhota said, according to The New York Times. "But you've got to think about what the products are that New Yorkers need."

Joseph J. Lhota, who led the Metropolitan Transportation Authority under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo before leaving for a failed mayoral run in 2013, has been chosen by the governor to return as chairman.The surprise, after-hours announcement was approved late on Wednesday by the State Senate after its Finance Committee voiced its support at an impromptu meeting in the Capitol, during which Mr. Lhota — speaking over Skype — expressed his frustration with problems with the city’s subways.“I know the M.T.A. can do a lot better,” he said.As New Yorkers reach a breaking point over the constant subway delays, Governor Cuomo has moved this week to strengthen his grip on the transportation authority, which runs the city’s transit system.But there is a catch: Mr. Cuomo already controls the agency, and has been calling the shots there for some time.

Mr. Lhota’s nomination came just hours after the authority’s monthly board meeting in Lower Manhattan, in which several members pushed back against Mr. Cuomo’s power grab. He had proposed legislation on Tuesday to add two new members to the authority’s board, whom he would select. Continue reading the main story

Board members urged Mr. Cuomo to focus on more pressing issues, including releasing a comprehensive plan to fix the creaky subway system and securing funding for the improvements.The board had been “neutered” by Mr. Cuomo’s growing influence, said Veronica Vanterpool, a member who had been recommended by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Many of the authority’s announcements come from the governor’s office, she said, and his preferences were prioritized in the five-year capital plan.Instead of an increase in the governor’s power, the board needs independence, Ms. Vanterpool said.“We need to ensure the decisions we’re making are on behalf of the public that we serve and not caught up in this political process that we’re often hampered by,” Ms. Vanterpool said.James E. Vitiello, a board member from Dutchess County, said he did not understand why Mr. Cuomo was suddenly trying to change the board’s structure when he had dallied for so long — nearly five months — in naming a permanent leader to run the agency.

“That just makes no sense to me,” Mr. Vitiello said.With the last scheduled day of the legislative session in Albany dragging past dark on Wednesday, it was unclear if Mr. Cuomo’s legislation might pass or if another bill, to split the roles of chairman and chief executive into two jobs, might. The governor’s father, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, similarly sought to add members to the board in 1983 to gain a majority, but he backed down after Mayor Edward I. Koch and suburban officials rose up in opposition.Scott Rechler, a new board member appointed by the governor, defended Mr. Cuomo’s legislation. Mr. Rechler said the governor wanted to take full responsibility for the agency — and its challenges. “Let him put 100 percent of his political capital, his expertise, his energy, his relationships into fixing something that is immensely broken,” he said.

Still, Mr. Cuomo has already exerted a great deal of influence over the authority. He took an active role in the completion of the Second Avenue subway and presided over its lavish opening. He has pressed for electronic tolling at bridges and tunnels and a project to add a track on the Long Island Rail Road.But only recently has he started focusing to a significant degree on the dismal performance of the subway system as riders have begun to accuse the governor of ignoring their plight.

The authority’s last chairman and chief executive, Thomas F. Prendergast, stepped down in January. The agency’s interim executive director, Veronique Hakim, interviewed for the top job, but Mr. Cuomo’s office apparently opted to go with a proven asset in Mr. Lhota. It was not clear if Mr. Cuomo still intended to create a separate position of chief executive, and if so, if Ms. Hakim would be considered for it.Ms. Vanterpool said board members were often left out of key decisions, including the Long Island Rail Road’s recent move to offer discounts to riders who are diverted during repairs at Pennsylvania Station in New York this summer. The railroad announced the discounts on Tuesday, a day after Mr. Cuomo called for them in a speech.Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner and a board member, offered another example of a time when the board was not consulted. When Mr. Cuomo announced the hiring of a new chief development officer for the authority in April, Ms. Trottenberg said, she learned about the news when she read it in The New York Times.On Wednesday, Ms. Trottenberg said that the governor had already been “hands-on” at the authority and that the city and the mayor also wanted to have a voice in the transit system. She declined to comment on the governor’s push to add two board members, but she had urged Mr. Cuomo to pick a leader for the authority.

Hours later, the governor chose Mr. Lhota, who said he wanted to hire an executive director to run the agency on a daily basis.“There’s a lot of basic work we have to get done,” he said.

Early life and education[edit]
Joe Lhota was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Jackie and Joseph "Joe" Lhota, a New York City police officer.[6] His paternal grandfather was a New York City firefighter, and his maternal grandfather was a New York City taxi driver. His father’s family is Czech. His maternal grandfather was of Italian descent and his maternal grandmother was Jewish.[7] Lhota was raised Catholic, and self-identifies as a Christian, although he is considered Jewish according to Jewish law.[1] The family later moved to Lindenhurst.[7] He was the first member of his family to attend college, graduating with honors from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with a degree in business administration in 1976. He received an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1980.[8]
Private sector career[edit]
Upon graduating from Georgetown University, Lhota joined Arthur Andersen & Co. in Washington, D.C. and specialized in health care finance. He worked there for two years before entering the Harvard Business School.[9] Following Harvard, Lhota returned to New York City and began a fourteen-year career as an investment banker at First Boston and Paine Webber. He specialized in public finance, serving state and local governments throughout the United States.
In 2002, Lhota became executive vice president of Cablevision, as well as president of Lightpath, a fiber-based telecommunications company that offered telephone and high speed data services to businesses throughout the New York area. In 2010, he joined The Madison Square Garden Company as executive vice president as a member of the senior management team and chief administrative officer.[10]




Joseph Lhota in January 2015


In early 2014, after his mayoral run, Lhota was appointed as senior vice president, vice dean, and chief of staff at NYU Langone Medical Center, in charge of "government outreach", emergency preparedness, and business planning.[11][12]
From 2002 to 2015, Lhota served as a member of the board of directors of First Aviation Services, Inc. In 2015, FAVS became a private company.[13][14] In 2014, Lhota became a board member of Cablevision Systems Corporation and was chairman of its audit committee until the company was sold in June 2016 to Altice USA.[15][16]
In 2016, Lhota became an independent member of the board of directors and chairman of the audit committee of MSG Networks.[17][18]
Public service career[edit]
Giuliani administration[edit]
In 1994, Lhota joined the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, where he held several positions over Giuliani's two terms. He first served as chief of staff to the deputy mayor for finance and economic development[19] and that year was quickly promoted to New York City finance commissioner.[20] In 1995, he was selected as director of the office of management and budget.[21] In 1998, Giuliani appointed Lhota to deputy mayor for operations.[22] As the head of the mayor's rat abatement task force, he was humorously known as "the Rat Czar".[23]
Lhota served as Mayor Giuliani's liaison to the White House, United States Congress, governor of New York, New York State Legislature and New York City Council. Additionally, he was responsible for oversight of the city’s relationships with the public employee unions and development of collective bargaining agreement strategies.
Chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority[edit]
On October 20, 2011, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo nominated Lhota to serve as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,[24] the largest mass transit provider in the United States (servicing 8.5 million customers daily). While awaiting confirmation by the New York State Senate, Lhota began serving as interim CEO.[25] He was unanimously confirmed on January 9, 2012.[26]

Lhota was responsible for New York City Transit’s Fastrack program, which saw more than $16 million in productivity gains in 2012, by concentrating and targeting subway station maintenance efforts. In July 2012, Lhota announced a $30 million service enhancement package that restored transportation services that the MTA had previously eliminated in 2010, and added new transit services in underserved areas, including Williamsburg, the South Bronx and Brooklyn Navy Yard—all New York City neighborhoods that had seen significant residential and commercial development since 2005. Lhota headed efforts to make information about the MTA and its services more accessible to its customers through its website and apps. He granted pay raises to managers at the MTA.[27]
When Hurricane Sandy devastated much of the New York metropolitan area in October 2012, Lhota shut down the MTA in advance of the storm and moved the system's trains to high ground to avoid damage from the storm surge. His other notable hurricane recovery measure was the rapid deployment of a free Rockaway Park Shuttle to service the worst damaged line in Rockaway, Queens.[28] Lhota also directed the MTA to provide regular details and updates to the public on the recovery efforts via social media and local news channels.[28]
In January 2017, Governor Cuomo appointed Lhota to the committee charged with conducting a nationwide search for a new Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the MTA.[29][30][31]
Mayoral candidacy[edit]

Main article: New York City mayoral election, 2013
Lhota resigned as head of the MTA on December 31, 2012, to explore running for mayor of New York City.[32] On January 17, 2013, he filed paperwork with the New York City Board of Elections and the New York State Board of Elections to formally launch his mayoral campaign.[33]
Lhota won the endorsements of all three major daily New York City newspapers for the Republican primary, with The New York Times stating, "few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works."[34] He won the primary on September 10, 2013 with 52.5% of the vote, defeating John Catsimatidis, who garnered 40.7%, and George T. McDonald, who captured 6.8%.[35]
In the general election campaign, Lhota received the endorsements of Crain's New York Business,[36] AM New York,[37] Newsday,[38] The Jewish Voice,[39] and The New York Post.[40]
Lhota's economic plan focused on job creation primarily through municipal tax cuts. He said he wanted to lower the General Corporation Tax, phase out the Commercial Rent Tax, reform the Unincorporated Business Tax, and lower the hotel tax.[41] He proposed to cut the hotel occupancy tax to 5% from 5.85%, and to lower property taxes.[42]
Lhota also proposed a tax incentive program to allow private sector developers to build mixed-use housing to incorporate affordable units.[43] He planned to improve education in New York City by doubling the number of public charter schools, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. He participated in a School Choice Rally organized by Success Academy Charter Schools to protest Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio's proposed rent requirement for the city's charter schools that were operating in public school buildings and ban on further co-location in public school buildings.[44] He also proposed universal pre-kindergarten without raising taxes.[citation needed]
Lhota lost the general election to de Blasio,[45] garnering 249,121 votes, or 24.3% of the voter turnout.[46]
Return to MTA[edit]
In June 2017, Lhota was nominated by Cuomo to return to Chairman of the MTA.[4] Lhota will remain at NYU Langone, as he will not be the day-to-day executive of the MTA, that being Veronique Hakim.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Lhota is married to Tamra Roberts Lhota. The couple met while she was working in Washington, D.C.[47] They have one child.[48]
While he was raised Catholic and identifies as Christian, Lhota's maternal grandmother was Jewish. When asked why he didn't capitalize on his religious heritage to garner the city's Jewish voters, he responded, "I think that would be patronizing."[49]
Political beliefs[edit]
Lhota defended his support for pro-choice and same-sex marriage as not only being in sync with New York City's socially liberal outlook but consistent with Jeffersonian republicanism or democracy and its intellectual premise in classical liberalism. His accommodation of fiscal conservatism and socially progressive views were criticized by some local social conservative groups while independents applauded his position as an example of third-way politics.[50] Lhota called for expulsion of Donald Trump from the Republican Party after Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States.[51]

Early life and education[edit]
Joe Lhota was born in the Bronx, New York, the son of Jackie and Joseph "Joe" Lhota, a New York City police officer.[6] His paternal grandfather was a New York City firefighter, and his maternal grandfather was a New York City taxi driver. His father’s family is Czech. His maternal grandfather was of Italian descent and his maternal grandmother was Jewish.[7] Lhota was raised Catholic, and self-identifies as a Christian, although he is considered Jewish according to Jewish law.[1] The family later moved to Lindenhurst.[7] He was the first member of his family to attend college, graduating with honors from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with a degree in business administration in 1976. He received an M.B.A. degree from Harvard Business School in 1980.[8]
Private sector career[edit]
Upon graduating from Georgetown University, Lhota joined Arthur Andersen & Co. in Washington, D.C. and specialized in health care finance. He worked there for two years before entering the Harvard Business School.[9] Following Harvard, Lhota returned to New York City and began a fourteen-year career as an investment banker at First Boston and Paine Webber. He specialized in public finance, serving state and local governments throughout the United States.
In 2002, Lhota became executive vice president of Cablevision, as well as president of Lightpath, a fiber-based telecommunications company that offered telephone and high speed data services to businesses throughout the New York area. In 2010, he joined The Madison Square Garden Company as executive vice president as a member of the senior management team and chief administrative officer.[10]




Joseph Lhota in January 2015


In early 2014, after his mayoral run, Lhota was appointed as senior vice president, vice dean, and chief of staff at NYU Langone Medical Center, in charge of "government outreach", emergency preparedness, and business planning.[11][12]
From 2002 to 2015, Lhota served as a member of the board of directors of First Aviation Services, Inc. In 2015, FAVS became a private company.[13][14] In 2014, Lhota became a board member of Cablevision Systems Corporation and was chairman of its audit committee until the company was sold in June 2016 to Altice USA.[15][16]
In 2016, Lhota became an independent member of the board of directors and chairman of the audit committee of MSG Networks.[17][18]
Public service career[edit]
Giuliani administration[edit]
In 1994, Lhota joined the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, where he held several positions over Giuliani's two terms. He first served as chief of staff to the deputy mayor for finance and economic development[19] and that year was quickly promoted to New York City finance commissioner.[20] In 1995, he was selected as director of the office of management and budget.[21] In 1998, Giuliani appointed Lhota to deputy mayor for operations.[22] As the head of the mayor's rat abatement task force, he was humorously known as "the Rat Czar".[23]
Lhota served as Mayor Giuliani's liaison to the White House, United States Congress, governor of New York, New York State Legislature and New York City Council. Additionally, he was responsible for oversight of the city’s relationships with the public employee unions and development of collective bargaining agreement strategies.
Chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority[edit]
On October 20, 2011, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo nominated Lhota to serve as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,[24] the largest mass transit provider in the United States (servicing 8.5 million customers daily). While awaiting confirmation by the New York State Senate, Lhota began serving as interim CEO.[25] He was unanimously confirmed on January 9, 2012.[26]

Lhota was responsible for New York City Transit’s Fastrack program, which saw more than $16 million in productivity gains in 2012, by concentrating and targeting subway station maintenance efforts. In July 2012, Lhota announced a $30 million service enhancement package that restored transportation services that the MTA had previously eliminated in 2010, and added new transit services in underserved areas, including Williamsburg, the South Bronx and Brooklyn Navy Yard—all New York City neighborhoods that had seen significant residential and commercial development since 2005. Lhota headed efforts to make information about the MTA and its services more accessible to its customers through its website and apps. He granted pay raises to managers at the MTA.[27]
When Hurricane Sandy devastated much of the New York metropolitan area in October 2012, Lhota shut down the MTA in advance of the storm and moved the system's trains to high ground to avoid damage from the storm surge. His other notable hurricane recovery measure was the rapid deployment of a free Rockaway Park Shuttle to service the worst damaged line in Rockaway, Queens.[28] Lhota also directed the MTA to provide regular details and updates to the public on the recovery efforts via social media and local news channels.[28]
In January 2017, Governor Cuomo appointed Lhota to the committee charged with conducting a nationwide search for a new Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the MTA.[29][30][31]
Mayoral candidacy[edit]

Main article: New York City mayoral election, 2013
Lhota resigned as head of the MTA on December 31, 2012, to explore running for mayor of New York City.[32] On January 17, 2013, he filed paperwork with the New York City Board of Elections and the New York State Board of Elections to formally launch his mayoral campaign.[33]
Lhota won the endorsements of all three major daily New York City newspapers for the Republican primary, with The New York Times stating, "few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works."[34] He won the primary on September 10, 2013 with 52.5% of the vote, defeating John Catsimatidis, who garnered 40.7%, and George T. McDonald, who captured 6.8%.[35]
In the general election campaign, Lhota received the endorsements of Crain's New York Business,[36] AM New York,[37] Newsday,[38] The Jewish Voice,[39] and The New York Post.[40]
Lhota's economic plan focused on job creation primarily through municipal tax cuts. He said he wanted to lower the General Corporation Tax, phase out the Commercial Rent Tax, reform the Unincorporated Business Tax, and lower the hotel tax.[41] He proposed to cut the hotel occupancy tax to 5% from 5.85%, and to lower property taxes.[42]
Lhota also proposed a tax incentive program to allow private sector developers to build mixed-use housing to incorporate affordable units.[43] He planned to improve education in New York City by doubling the number of public charter schools, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. He participated in a School Choice Rally organized by Success Academy Charter Schools to protest Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio's proposed rent requirement for the city's charter schools that were operating in public school buildings and ban on further co-location in public school buildings.[44] He also proposed universal pre-kindergarten without raising taxes.[citation needed]
Lhota lost the general election to de Blasio,[45] garnering 249,121 votes, or 24.3% of the voter turnout.[46]
Return to MTA[edit]
In June 2017, Lhota was nominated by Cuomo to return to Chairman of the MTA.[4] Lhota will remain at NYU Langone, as he will not be the day-to-day executive of the MTA, that being Veronique Hakim.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Lhota is married to Tamra Roberts Lhota. The couple met while she was working in Washington, D.C.[47] They have one child.[48]
While he was raised Catholic and identifies as Christian, Lhota's maternal grandmother was Jewish. When asked why he didn't capitalize on his religious heritage to garner the city's Jewish voters, he responded, "I think that would be patronizing."[49]
Political beliefs[edit]
Lhota defended his support for pro-choice and same-sex marriage as not only being in sync with New York City's socially liberal outlook but consistent with Jeffersonian republicanism or democracy and its intellectual premise in classical liberalism. His accommodation of fiscal conservatism and socially progressive views were criticized by some local social conservative groups while independents applauded his position as an example of third-way politics.[50] Lhota called for expulsion of Donald Trump from the Republican Party after Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States.[51]

In early 2014, after his mayoral run, Lhota was appointed as senior vice president, vice dean, and chief of staff at NYU Langone Medical Center, in charge of "government outreach", emergency preparedness, and business planning.[11][12]
From 2002 to 2015, Lhota served as a member of the board of directors of First Aviation Services, Inc. In 2015, FAVS became a private company.[13][14] In 2014, Lhota became a board member of Cablevision Systems Corporation and was chairman of its audit committee until the company was sold in June 2016 to Altice USA.[15][16]
In 2016, Lhota became an independent member of the board of directors and chairman of the audit committee of MSG Networks.[17][18]
Public service career[edit]
Giuliani administration[edit]
In 1994, Lhota joined the administration of Mayor Rudy Giuliani, where he held several positions over Giuliani's two terms. He first served as chief of staff to the deputy mayor for finance and economic development[19] and that year was quickly promoted to New York City finance commissioner.[20] In 1995, he was selected as director of the office of management and budget.[21] In 1998, Giuliani appointed Lhota to deputy mayor for operations.[22] As the head of the mayor's rat abatement task force, he was humorously known as "the Rat Czar".[23]
Lhota served as Mayor Giuliani's liaison to the White House, United States Congress, governor of New York, New York State Legislature and New York City Council. Additionally, he was responsible for oversight of the city’s relationships with the public employee unions and development of collective bargaining agreement strategies.
Chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority[edit]
On October 20, 2011, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo nominated Lhota to serve as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority,[24] the largest mass transit provider in the United States (servicing 8.5 million customers daily). While awaiting confirmation by the New York State Senate, Lhota began serving as interim CEO.[25] He was unanimously confirmed on January 9, 2012.[26]

Lhota was responsible for New York City Transit’s Fastrack program, which saw more than $16 million in productivity gains in 2012, by concentrating and targeting subway station maintenance efforts. In July 2012, Lhota announced a $30 million service enhancement package that restored transportation services that the MTA had previously eliminated in 2010, and added new transit services in underserved areas, including Williamsburg, the South Bronx and Brooklyn Navy Yard—all New York City neighborhoods that had seen significant residential and commercial development since 2005. Lhota headed efforts to make information about the MTA and its services more accessible to its customers through its website and apps. He granted pay raises to managers at the MTA.[27]
When Hurricane Sandy devastated much of the New York metropolitan area in October 2012, Lhota shut down the MTA in advance of the storm and moved the system's trains to high ground to avoid damage from the storm surge. His other notable hurricane recovery measure was the rapid deployment of a free Rockaway Park Shuttle to service the worst damaged line in Rockaway, Queens.[28] Lhota also directed the MTA to provide regular details and updates to the public on the recovery efforts via social media and local news channels.[28]
In January 2017, Governor Cuomo appointed Lhota to the committee charged with conducting a nationwide search for a new Chair and Chief Executive Officer of the MTA.[29][30][31]
Mayoral candidacy[edit]

Lhota's campaign outreaches to New York City's Indian immigrant community


Main article: New York City mayoral election, 2013
Lhota resigned as head of the MTA on December 31, 2012, to explore running for mayor of New York City.[32] On January 17, 2013, he filed paperwork with the New York City Board of Elections and the New York State Board of Elections to formally launch his mayoral campaign.[33]
Lhota won the endorsements of all three major daily New York City newspapers for the Republican primary, with The New York Times stating, "few people know better than Mr. Lhota how city government works."[34] He won the primary on September 10, 2013 with 52.5% of the vote, defeating John Catsimatidis, who garnered 40.7%, and George T. McDonald, who captured 6.8%.[35]
In the general election campaign, Lhota received the endorsements of Crain's New York Business,[36] AM New York,[37] Newsday,[38] The Jewish Voice,[39] and The New York Post.[40]
Lhota's economic plan focused on job creation primarily through municipal tax cuts. He said he wanted to lower the General Corporation Tax, phase out the Commercial Rent Tax, reform the Unincorporated Business Tax, and lower the hotel tax.[41] He proposed to cut the hotel occupancy tax to 5% from 5.85%, and to lower property taxes.[42]
Lhota also proposed a tax incentive program to allow private sector developers to build mixed-use housing to incorporate affordable units.[43] He planned to improve education in New York City by doubling the number of public charter schools, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. He participated in a School Choice Rally organized by Success Academy Charter Schools to protest Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio's proposed rent requirement for the city's charter schools that were operating in public school buildings and ban on further co-location in public school buildings.[44] He also proposed universal pre-kindergarten without raising taxes.[citation needed]
Lhota lost the general election to de Blasio,[45] garnering 249,121 votes, or 24.3% of the voter turnout.[46]
Return to MTA[edit]
In June 2017, Lhota was nominated by Cuomo to return to Chairman of the MTA.[4] Lhota will remain at NYU Langone, as he will not be the day-to-day executive of the MTA, that being Veronique Hakim.[5]
Personal life[edit]
Lhota is married to Tamra Roberts Lhota. The couple met while she was working in Washington, D.C.[47] They have one child.[48]
While he was raised Catholic and identifies as Christian, Lhota's maternal grandmother was Jewish. When asked why he didn't capitalize on his religious heritage to garner the city's Jewish voters, he responded, "I think that would be patronizing."[49]
Political beliefs[edit]
Lhota defended his support for pro-choice and same-sex marriage as not only being in sync with New York City's socially liberal outlook but consistent with Jeffersonian republicanism or democracy and its intellectual premise in classical liberalism. His accommodation of fiscal conservatism and socially progressive views were criticized by some local social conservative groups while independents applauded his position as an example of third-way politics.[50] Lhota called for expulsion of Donald Trump from the Republican Party after Trump's remarks about banning Muslims from entering the United States.[51]

His maternal grandfather was of Italian descent and his maternal grandmother was Jewish.[7] Lhota was raised Catholic, and self-identifies as a Christian, although he is considered Jewish according to Jewish law.[1] The family later moved to Lindenhurst.[7] He was the first member of his family to attend college, graduating with honors from Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business with a degree in business administration in 1976.

Biography of Joseph Lhota


The New York Times called Joe Lhota "a calm voice for a combative Mayor." From 1998 until December 31, 2001, Lohta served as the chief operating officer of New York City and played a crucial role in the City's impressive and steadfast response to the tragic events of September 11, 2001.At his desk in City Hall on the morning of the attacks, Lhota heard the explosions and immediately rushed to the World Trade Center to meet Mayor Rudolph Guliani, to assess the damage, and to help direct emergency efforts. As the Mayoral team arrived, a second plane was approaching the south tower. Taking refuge at 75 Barclay Street, an office building just north of the twin towers, they made their way below ground to safety and eventually to a command post to help speed assistance to the victims.As the man responsible for overseeing all of the operating agencies of New York City, Joe Lhota was an indispensable member of the team that made New York a symbol of hope and American fortitude in the face of the first attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor. Working with the police and fire departments, the business community, medical professionals, federal officials, and ordinary citizens, Lhota and members of the Mayor's team established a model of emergency response.Lhota also played a key role in responding to the real human needs of the New York tragedy. He provided comfort to the families of the victims and directed efforts to help them.Prior to his appointment as Deputy Mayor by Mayor Giuliani, Lhota served as the City's Budget Director and, before that, Finance Commissioner. He was responsible for the successful development of the City's successive years of record-setting surpluses.In January 2002, Lhota joined Cablevision Systems Corporation, one of the nation's leading telecommunications and entertainment companies. He is currently the President of Cablevision Lightpath, Inc, the company's fiber-optic telecommunications division providing circuit-based telephony and high-speed data services to business customers throughout the New York metropolitan area.Lhota is a trustee of The City University of New York, received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University, and his MBA from the Harvard Business School.

Joseph J. Lhota is perhaps best known for bringing the New York City subway back from one of its darkest moments after Hurricane Sandy flooded the system in 2012. Now, he faces another daunting task: rescuing it from a growing crisis that threatens to cripple the city’s continued growth.With subway delays mounting and riders irate, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo turned to a familiar face on Wednesday: Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who will return for a second act.State lawmakers applauded the decision to bring back Mr. Lhota, who served as chairman for about a year before stepping down in 2012 to run for mayor of New York City. Mr. Lhota, a deputy mayor under Rudolph W. Giuliani, used the good will he gained after the storm to run as a Republican, but lost to Bill de Blasio in a landslide.His appointment — a late-night surprise on the final day of the legislative session in Albany — almost did not happen. On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said Mr. Lhota “didn’t say yes until 20 minutes before we put his name up.”

Mr. Lhota confirmed in an interview that it had taken a bit of prodding from the governor to convince him. “I wouldn’t call it arm-twisting,” he said. “I had to do some soul searching.” Continue reading the main story

Ultimately, Mr. Lhota said he knew the system was broken and he wanted to help fix it.“I love a challenge, and anyone who knows me knows I love a challenge,” he said. “It ain’t going to be easy.”

Mr. Lhota is known for his outspoken style, from amusing Twitter posts about having sipped “too much wine” and his distaste for “Jersey Shore” to his contentious take that subway trains should not stop for kittens on the tracks, which prompted a Daily News cover reading “Die Kitties Die!” He is also a subway rider, using the No. 2 and 3 lines to travel from his home in Brooklyn Heights.But Mr. Lhota now confronts a dire challenge: The subway is plagued by skyrocketing delays and fraying infrastructure. Long Island Rail Road commuters are facing a “summer of hell” as tracks are repaired at Pennsylvania Station. The sprawling transit network needs billions of dollars in repairs, and Mr. Lhota told lawmakers on Wednesday that fixing the subway would probably require even more painful disruptions for riders.Business leaders and transit advocates welcomed his return.Mr. Cuomo “has once again recruited an excellent leader for one of the toughest jobs in government,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group. “Joe Lhota led the M.T.A. through Hurricane Sandy and is the right choice to lead the M.T.A. through the current crisis.”The governor’s office said Mr. Lhota would continue to serve as a senior vice president at NYU Langone Medical Center and would receive an annual salary of $1 as chairman. A separate executive officer will handle the agency’s daily operations, a role Mr. Cuomo said he was still seeking to fill. The arrangement is a departure from recent years, when one full-time leader served both roles.Mr. de Blasio threw his support behind Mr. Lhota on Thursday, saying he was the right person for the job when the agency was at a crossroads. Asked whether Mr. Cuomo was trying to “poke a stick” in his eye by naming Mr. Lhota, Mr. de Blasio said, “I think it has nothing to do with politics.”“Joe Lhota and I ran against each other, but I have a lot of respect for him,” Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on WNYC.

But a few hours later, Mr. Cuomo turned on Mr. de Blasio, saying the city should pay more toward the M.T.A. and complaining that he, as governor, did not have the control he needed over the agency. Mr. Cuomo had proposed legislation to add two members to the authority’s board, whom he could appoint, but it failed to pass at the end of the session.

Though Mr. Cuomo has taken a hands-on role at the authority, he said the way it was set up made it unclear who was in control.“Who’s in charge?” he asked reporters. “Who knows.”Mr. Lhota’s appointment was a surprise, in part because he had said in January that he was not interested. In response to a Twitter post asking who would succeed the authority’s previous chairman and chief executive, Thomas F. Prendergast, he was unequivocal: “Not @JoeLhota. That’s a fact.”

Two other candidates had recently interviewed for the job: Veronique Hakim, the agency’s interim executive director, who would have been the first woman to hold the position, and Patrick J. Foye, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Mr. Lhota said he respected Ms. Hakim and would consider her for the executive officer role.Even if many were pleased by Mr. Lhota’s return, some criticized the lack of transparency by Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, in naming him at the last minute. After Mr. Prendergast stepped down in January, Mr. Cuomo stalled on announcing a replacement, even as the system’s problems mounted. The State Senate confirmed Mr. Lhota as chairman around 11:30 p.m. on Wednesday, shortly before adjourning for the year.In a hastily called Senate meeting Wednesday night, Mr. Lhota took questions from lawmakers via Skype. He noted that the subway runs around the clock and said that in order to replace the antiquated signal system — which dates to the 1930s and frequently fails, causing delays — officials might have to temporarily shut down lines, despite the hardship that would cause riders.“If we want to get the signal system in as fast as possible, we’re going to have to do something like that,” he said.State Senator Michael Gianaris, Democrat of Queens, said the late-night meeting offered little opportunity for public discussion and criticized lawmakers for failing to address the subway crisis.“Better management is only part of the problem,” Mr. Gianaris said. “A lack of resources and historic underfunding is a huge part of the problem, and we did nothing to address that.”
