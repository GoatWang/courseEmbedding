On March 23, 2017, Global Indemnity Limited completed its previously announced sale of $120 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Subordinated Notes due 2047 (the Firm Notes) to the several underwriters named in Schedule II (the Underwriters) to the Underwriting Agreement, dated March 16, 2017 (the Underwriting Agreement), by and between the Company and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, UBS Securities LLC and RBC Capital Markets, LLC, as managers for the Underwriters. Pursuant to the underwriting agreement, the company granted the Underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $18 million aggregate principal amount of its 7.875% Subordinated Notes due 2047, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. The notes bear interest at an annual rate equal to 7.875%, payable quarterly in arrears on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2017. The Notes mature on April 15, 2047.

The Firm Notes were issued in minimum denominations of $25 and integral multiples.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of Global Indemnity included elsewhere in this report. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this report, including information with respect to the Company's plans and strategy, constitutes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please see "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this Item 7 and "Risk Factors" in Item 1A above for more information. You should review "Risk Factors" in Item 1A above for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein.  Recent Developments  On June 20, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors unanimously approved a plan for the Company to redomicile from Ireland to the Cayman Islands. On September 14, 2016, the Company held a special meeting of the holders of its A ordinary shares and B ordinary shares and an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders. All resolutions required to effectuate the redomestication were approved by the requisite shareholder vote. On October 21, 2016, the High Court of Ireland sanctioned Global Indemnity plc's scheme of arrangement related to the redomestication from Ireland to Cayman Islands. The redomestication transaction was completed on November 7, 2016 and as a result, Global Indemnity Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company, replaced Global Indemnity plc as the ultimate holding company of the Global Indemnity group of companies.  In connection with the redomestication to the Cayman Islands, each A ordinary share of Global Indemnity plc was cancelled and replaced with one A ordinary share of Global Indemnity Limited and each B ordinary share of Global Indemnity plc was cancelled and replaced with one B ordinary share of Global Indemnity Limited. The Global Indemnity Limited A ordinary shares trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market ("NASDAQ") under the ticker symbol GBLI, the same symbol under which Global Indemnity plc's A ordinary shares were previously listed.  On September 30, 2016, Diamond State Insurance Company sold all the outstanding shares of capital stock of one of its wholly owned subsidiaries, United National Specialty Insurance Company, to an unrelated party. Diamond State Insurance Company received a one-time payment of $18.7 million and recognized a pretax gain of $6.9 million which is reflected in other income. This transaction will not have an impact on the Company's ongoing business operations. Going forward, any business previously written by United National Specialty Insurance Company has been and will be written by other companies within the Company's U.S. Insurance Operations.  James W. Crystal and Larry N. Port resigned from the Company's Board of Directors effective July 24, 2016 and July 28, 2016, respectively.  Overview  In connection with the acquisition of American Reliable in 2015, the Company reevaluated segment classifications and determined that the Company will operate and manage its business through three business segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Reinsurance Operations.  The Company's Commercial Lines segment distribute property and casualty insurance products through a group of approximately 120 professional general agencies that have limited quoting and binding authority, as well as a number of wholesale insurance brokers who in turn sell the Company's insurance products to insureds through  Table of Contents  retail insurance brokers. Commercial Lines operates predominantly in the excess and surplus lines marketplace. The Company manages its Commercial Lines segment via product classification. These product classifications are: 1) Penn-America, which includes property and general liability products for small commercial businesses distributed through a select network of wholesale general agents with specific binding authority; 2) United National, which includes property, general liability, and professional lines products distributed through program administrators with specific binding authority; and 3) Diamond State, which includes property, casualty, and professional lines products distributed through wholesale brokers and program administrators with specific binding authority.  The Company's Personal Lines segment, via American Reliable, offers specialty personal lines and agricultural coverage through a group of approximately 290 agents, primarily comprised of wholesale general agents, with specific binding authority in the admitted marketplace.  The Company's Reinsurance Operations, consisting solely of the operations of Global Indemnity Reinsurance, currently provides reinsurance solutions through brokers and on a direct basis. Global Indemnity Reinsurance is a Bermuda based treaty reinsurer for specialty property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. Global Indemnity Reinsurance conducts business in Bermuda and is focused on using its capital capacity to write catastrophe-oriented placements and other niche or specialty-focused treaties meeting the Company's risk tolerance and return thresholds.  The Company derives its revenues primarily from premiums paid on insurance policies that it writes and from income generated by its investment portfolio, net of fees paid for investment management services. The amount of insurance premiums that the Company receives is a function of the amount and type of policies it writes, as well as prevailing market prices.  The Company's expenses include losses and loss adjustment expenses, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, corporate and other operating expenses, interest, investment expenses, and income taxes. Losses and loss adjustment expenses are estimated by management and reflect the Company's best estimate of ultimate losses and costs arising during the reporting period and revisions of prior period estimates. The Company records its best estimate of losses and loss adjustment expenses considering both internal and external actuarial analyses of the estimated losses the Company expects to incur on the insurance policies it writes. The ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses will depend on the actual costs to resolve claims. Acquisition costs consist principally of commissions and premium taxes that are typically a percentage of the premiums on the insurance policies the Company writes, net of ceding commissions earned from reinsurers. Other underwriting expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses and general operating expenses related to underwriting activities. Corporate and other operating expenses are comprised primarily of outside legal fees, other professional and accounting fees, directors' fees, management fees, and salaries and benefits for company personnel whose services relate to the support of corporate activities. In 2016, corporate expenses also included $4.2 million of expenses related to the redomestication. In 2015, corporate expenses also included $8.3 million of expenses related to the acquisition of American Reliable. Interest expense is primarily comprised of amounts due on outstanding debt.  Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies  The Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. See Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.  The Company believes that of the Company's significant accounting policies, the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation.  Table of Contents  Liability for Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses  Although variability is inherent in estimates, the Company believes that the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses reflects Management's best estimate for future amounts needed to pay losses and related loss adjustment expenses and the impact of its reinsurance coverage with respect to insured events.  In developing loss and loss adjustment expense ("loss" or "losses") reserve estimates for the US Insurance Operations, the Company's actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses each quarter. To perform the analysis, the data is organized at a "reserve category" level. A reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. The reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as long-tail or short-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. The Company's long-tail exposures include general liability, professional liability, products liability, commercial automobile liability, and excess and umbrella. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, and equine mortality. To manage its insurance operations, the Company differentiates by product classifications, which are Penn-America, United National, Diamond State, and American Reliable. For further discussion about the Company's product classifications, see "General-Business Segments-Insurance Operations" in Item 1 of Part I of this report. Each of the Company's product classifications contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Every reserve category is analyzed by the Company's actuaries each quarter. Management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections.  Loss reserve estimates for the Company's Reinsurance Operations are developed by independent, external actuaries; at least annually; however, management is responsible for the final determination of loss reserve selections. The data for this analysis is organized by treaty and treaty year. As with the Company's reserves for its Insurance Operations, reserves for its Reinsurance Operations are characterized as long-tail or short-tail. Long-tail exposures include workers compensation, professional liability, and excess and umbrella liability. Short-tail exposures are primarily catastrophe exposed property and marine accounts.  In addition to the Company's internal reserve analysis, independent external actuaries perform a full, detailed review of the Insurance and Reinsurance Operations' reserves annually. The Company reviews both the internal and external actuarial analyses in determining its reserve position.  The actuarial methods used to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail reserve categories include, but are not limited to, the following:   Paid Development method;   Incurred Development method;   Expected Loss Ratio method;   Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and paid loss;   Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and incurred loss; and   Average Loss method.  The Paid Development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss. Selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can impact the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.  Table of Contents  For many reserve categories, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for reliable loss projections. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail reserve categories.  The Incurred Development method is similar to the Paid Development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since this method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the Paid Development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid development patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the Paid Development method. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.  The Expected Loss Ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year. This method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes, and other applicable factors.  The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and paid losses is a combination of the Paid Development method and the Expected Loss Ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the method used for the Expected Loss Ratio method and requires analysis of the same factors described above. The method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the Paid Development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the Paid Development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the Paid Development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each accident year. This method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the Expected Loss Ratio calculation.  The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and incurred losses is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and paid losses except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid development patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place. The method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the Expected Loss Ratio and Incurred Development methods.  The Average Loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate incurred claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve categories where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that impact the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the Company, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss requires analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.  For many reserve categories, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a  Table of Contents  case, the Company's actuaries typically assign more weight to the Incurred Development method than to the Paid Development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid losses increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the Paid Development method. For most of the Company's reserve categories, even the case incurred losses for accident years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, the Company will not assign any weight to the Paid and Incurred Development methods and will use the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Expected Loss Ratio methods. For short-tail exposures, the Paid and Incurred Development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because the Company's history includes a sufficient number of accident years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, the Company may also assign weights to the Expected Loss Ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Average Loss methods for short-tail exposures when developing estimates of ultimate losses.  Generally, reserves for long-tail lines give more weight to the Expected Loss Ratio method in the more recent immature years. As the accident years mature, weight shifts to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods and eventually to the Incurred and/or Paid Development method. Claims related to umbrella business are usually reported later than claims for other long-tail lines. For umbrella business, the shift from the Expected Loss Ratio method to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods to the Loss Development method may be more protracted than for most long-tailed lines. Reserves for short-tail lines tend to make the shift across methods more quickly than the long-tail lines.  For other more complex reserve categories where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, the Company uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation. Such reserve categories include losses from construction defect and A&E claims.  For construction defect losses, the Company's actuaries organize losses by the year in which they were reported to develop an IBNR provision for development on known cases. To estimate losses from claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company (pure IBNR), various extrapolation techniques are applied to the pattern of claims that have been reported to estimate the number of claims yet to be reported. This process requires analysis of several factors including the rate at which policyholders report claims to the Company, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. An average claim size is determined from past experience and applied to the number of unreported claims to estimate reserves for these claims.  Establishing reserves for A&E and other mass tort claims involves considerably more judgment than other types of claims due to, among other things, inconsistent court decisions, bankruptcy filings as a result of asbestos-related liabilities, and judicial interpretations that often expand theories of recovery and broaden the scope of coverage. The insurance industry continues to receive a substantial number of asbestos-related bodily injury claims, with an increasing focus being directed toward other parties, including installers of products containing asbestos rather than against asbestos manufacturers. This shift has resulted in significant insurance coverage litigation implicating applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including but not limited to, determinations as to whether or not an asbestos-related bodily injury claim is subject to aggregate limits of liability found in most comprehensive general liability policies. The Company continues to closely monitor its asbestos exposure and make adjustments where they are warranted.  Reserve analyses performed by the Company's internal and external actuaries result in actuarial point estimates. The results of the detailed reserve reviews were summarized and discussed with the Company's senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. This group considered many factors in making this decision. The factors included, but were not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices, changes in the Company's pricing and underwriting, and overall pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market.  Table of Contents  Management's best estimate at December 31, 2016 was recorded as the loss reserve. Management's best estimate is as of a particular point in time and is based upon known facts, the Company's actuarial analyses, current law, and the Company's judgment. This resulted in carried gross and net reserves of $651.0 million and $520.6 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. A breakout of the Company's gross and net reserves, excluding the effects of the Company's intercompany pooling arrangements and intercompany stop loss and quota share reinsurance agreements, as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:   Gross Reserves (Dollars in thousands) Case IBNR (1) Total Commercial Lines $ 127,245 $ 331,400 $ 458,645 Personal Lines 65,487 61,863 127,350 Reinsurance Operations 16,670 48,377 65,047 Total $ 209,402 $ 441,640 $ 651,042   Net Reserves (2) (Dollars in thousands) Case IBNR (1) Total Commercial Lines $ 103,492 $ 273,760 $ 377,252 Personal Lines 26,681 51,860 78,541 Reinsurance Operations 16,670 48,140 64,810 Total $ 146,843 $ 373,760 $ 520,603  (1) Losses incurred but not reported, including the expected future emergence of case reserves.  (2) Does not include reinsurance receivable on paid losses.  The Company continually reviews these estimates and, based on new developments and information, includes adjustments of the estimated ultimate liability in the operating results for the periods in which the adjustments are made. The establishment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves makes no provision for the possible broadening of coverage by legislative action or judicial interpretation, or the emergence of new types of losses not sufficiently represented in the Company's historical experience or that cannot yet be quantified or estimated. The Company regularly analyzes its reserves and reviews reserving methodologies so that future adjustments to prior accident year reserves can be minimized. However, given the complexity of this process, reserves require continual updates and the ultimate liability may be higher or lower than previously indicated. Changes in estimates for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are recorded in the period that the change in these estimates is made. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of this report for details concerning the changes in the estimate for incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses related to prior accident years.  The detailed reserve analyses that the Company's internal and external actuaries complete use a variety of generally accepted actuarial methods and techniques to produce a number of estimates of ultimate loss. The Company determines its best estimate of ultimate loss by reviewing the various estimates provided by its actuaries and other relevant information. The reserve estimate is the difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the losses paid to date. The difference between the estimated ultimate loss and the case incurred loss (paid loss plus case reserve) is considered to be IBNR. IBNR calculated as such includes a provision for development on known cases (supplemental development) as well as a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to the Company (pure IBNR).  In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels, the Company reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined.  The key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve categories and accident years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but  Table of Contents  most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the Paid Development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. Loss frequency is a measure of the number of claims per unit of insured exposure, and loss severity is a measure of the average size of claims. Each reserve category has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made.  Previous reserve analyses have resulted in the Company's identification of information and trends that have caused it to increase or decrease frequency and severity assumptions in prior periods and could lead to the identification of a need for additional material changes in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings. Factors affecting loss frequency include, among other things, the effectiveness of loss controls and safety programs and changes in economic activity or weather patterns. Factors affecting loss severity include, among other things, changes in policy limits and deductibles, rate of inflation and judicial interpretations. Another factor affecting estimates of loss frequency and severity is the loss reporting lag, . . .  Mar 10, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
