Tips for Searching Avaya Support

A good query consists of three things:

Product or Category
Issue / Symptom / Procedure
General Details

 Enclose exact words or phrases in double quotes. Include plus (+) to require words, minus (--) to exclude words, and OR between words. i.e. forwarding OR coverage + "all calls"-- remote
 
Don't include "special" characters in your search (i.e. &, <, >, *, $, / ,\, ....)
 
The more exact the phrases are to the actual title or string of text in a document, the better the results

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]
Patents[edit]
Avaya bought Nortel Enterprise and acquired its patents, including:[40][41]

US20050007951 – Routed split multi-link trunking[42]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

Avaya's headquarters are at 4655 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California. The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]
Patents[edit]
Avaya bought Nortel Enterprise and acquired its patents, including:[40][41]

US20050007951 – Routed split multi-link trunking[42]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

Avaya's headquarters are at 4655 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California. The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]
Patents[edit]
Avaya bought Nortel Enterprise and acquired its patents, including:[40][41]

US20050007951 – Routed split multi-link trunking[42]
7173934 – System, device and method for improving communication-network reliability using trunk splitting[43]

About Avaya Inc.

Avaya helps to tie the corporate world together. The company's
communication equipment and software integrate voice and data
services for customers including large corporations, government
agencies, and small businesses. Its office phone systems
incorporate Internet protocol (IP) and Session Initiation protocol
(SIP) telephony, messaging, web access, and interactive voice
response. Avaya also offers a wide array of consulting,
integration, and other managed IT services. More than half of its
sales are in the US. In 2017 the company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy to deal with a heavy debt load.
Bankruptcy
Avaya filed for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy in
January 2017 as it sought to reduce its debt. The company took on
debt when it was acquired by Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital
in 2007. At the time of the transaction, Avaya focused on providing
telecommunications hardware. Since then many of the tasks handled
through hardware have shifted to software, a trend that has had a
negative impact on networking hardware companies like Avaya. As a
result, Avaya has had increasing difficulty in meeting its debt
obligations. The company arranged $725 million in financing,
underwritten by Citibank, to get it through the bankruptcy
proceedings.
In April 2017 Avaya filed a restricting plan with the bankruptcy
court. The company would reduce its pre-filing debt by $4 billion
and secured creditors would own 100% of the company's shares,
according to the plan.
Avaya also agreed to sell its networking business to Extreme
Networks for about $100 million. The deal was expected to close by
the middle of 2017.


Operations
Avaya divides its operations across three segments. Two of the
segments -- Global Communications Solutions (GCS; about 40% of
sales) and Avaya Networking (about 5% of sales) -- make up the
company's Enterprise Collaboration Solutions product portfolio. The
third segment is Avaya Global Services (AGS; more than half of
sales).
GCS offers business collaboration and communications software
used to make IT infrastructure for communications contact centers.
Avaya Networking makes Ethernet switches, routers, a virtual
private network technology products, while AGS offers IT consulting
and advisement services.
Geographic Reach
Avaya operates through about 178 leased facilities and two owned
facilities spanning some 58 countries. It has 11 primary research
and development facilities in Canada, China, Germany, India,
Ireland, Israel, Italy, and the US.
Customers in the US buy 54% of Avaya's products, followed by
Europe with 26%, Asia-Pacific at 11%, and Canada and Latin America,
9%.
Sales and Marketing
About a quarter of Avaya's sales were made directly in 2015, and
the company's sales strategy has emphasized building its channel
partnerships. The company continues to offer traditional
communications equipment with an eye toward migrating legacy voice
network equipment to IP-based systems.
Financial Performance
Avaya's revenue slide continued in 2015 (ended September),
dropping 7% to $4 billion. The company has lower sales through all
its market all geographic segments. Sales for its legacy product
continued to fall in 2015 while currency exchange rates also
reduced revenue.
While Avaya has lost money for nine out of the past 10 years it
has narrowed losses in the last two years. It reported a loss of
$144 million in 2015, compared to a $231 million loss in 2014.
Cash flow from operations rose to $215 million in 2015 from $40
million in 2014.
Strategy
Avaya sold non-core businesses and released a steady stream of
products and services that expanded its cloud computing and mobile
offerings.
The company sold its IT Professional Services business for $101
million as well as the Technology Business Unit (for $14 million),
which had been acquired with RADVISION Ltd.
In 2017 the company's recurring revenue, a key measure of
software-as-a-service, had increased to almost 60% of the total, a
high for the company. Revenue from software and services was about
80% of the total, another record for Avaya.
Should the company's bankruptcy plan be approved and
implemented, it should give Avaya room to maneuver by investing in
research and development in software and services as well as sales
and marketing efforts. The sale of its networking business would
provide an infusion of cash while divesting the unit with the
fastest decline in revenue.
Mergers and Acquisitions
Avaya boosted its cloud offerings, in part, through
acquisitions. In 2015, it bought Esna, a provider of cloud-based
unified communications. Esna operate as a wholly-owned Avaya
subsidiary. The move helps position Avaya as a provider of mobile
and cloud-centric collaboration technologies.
The company previously acquired IT Navigator Ltd., a global
provider of cloud, social media, and management products and
services. The integration of their portfolios enhanced Avaya's
cloud as well as its unified communication and contact center
products.

Avaya Helps RSPCA Queensland Talk to the Animals
Jun 15 17
The Queensland branch of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA Queensland) has further invested in the welfare of abandoned and injured animals with the widespread adoption of Avaya video conferencing technology. The solution enables RSPCA's diverse workforce to engage in better, faster collection, care, treatment and placement of animals. The animal welfare agency has seen a significant increase in the number of cared-for animals in the state in the last two years, from about 44,000 in 2014/15 to more than 51,000 domestic and native animals in 2016. The work is conducted by a vast team of regional inspectors, animal behaviorists, veterinarians and other personnel, who correspond with US-based professionals as required. The introduction of advanced communications solutions like Avaya video conferencing have played a key role in enabling the RSPCA Queensland to grow its mission. Given its geographically-dispersed operations across Queensland, the agency required smarter ways of connecting more than 300 employees and its army of 5,000 volunteers. Previously, workers spent hours traveling across the state to assess and rescue animals, subsequently transporting the animals to facilities where they could administer full treatment if resources were not available in the field. RSPCA Queensland alleviated this issue using Avaya video conferencing, giving it a purpose-built solution that ensures reliable communication. The technology delivers high-quality feeds on a lower bandwidth to keep the workforce connected, and consequently reduces mounting operational costs, all of which are supported by donations. Using the mobile-friendly Avaya solution, field workers and behaviorists can accurately assess abandoned animals in real-time by connecting to branch offices, Australian veterinarians, or overseas specialists from any location. This increases the number of healthy pets placed with new families. For example, dogs were previously taken to a main office to be filmed, with the videos sent to specialists for evaluation; using video conferencing helps RSPCA Queensland continue saving more animals than any other organization in the Southern Hemisphere. RSPCA Queensland also uses Avaya video conferencing for its education programs to further develop its staff, volunteers, and veterinary teams, eliminating the need for them to travel to a central location to participate in training. With high-quality video that also includes file sharing and chat capabilities, education can be delivered in real-time from operating theatres to all participants anytime and anywhere. Resources can therefore be invested in productivity rather than travel. The animal welfare agency has identified other opportunities to leverage the Avaya video solution. This includes a training program through which experts help dog owners train their pets, and a crisis notification system that relays crucial messages to workers. RSPCA Queensland's success using the Avaya video conferencing solution has inspired other RSPCA branches to assess potential use cases for the technology within their own operations.

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

Avaya's headquarters are at 4655 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California. The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]
Patents[edit]
Avaya bought Nortel Enterprise and acquired its patents, including:[40][41]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]
Locations and support[edit]

Avaya's headquarters are at 4655 Great America Parkway, Santa Clara, California. The company had offices in over 145 countries in 2011.[31] Avaya sponsors a users' group[32] and training programs for IT professional certification in the use of Avaya's products.[33] In 1985, Performance Engineering Corporation (later PEC Solutions) was formed to offer technology services to government customers.[34] On June 6, 2005, Nortel acquired PEC Solutions to form Nortel PEC Solutions.[35][36] On January 18, 2006, Nortel PEC Solutions was renamed Nortel Government Solutions.[37] On December 21, 2009, Avaya acquired Nortel's government business as part of the company's assets sale.[38][39]

Avaya bought Nortel Enterprise and acquired its patents, including:[40][41]

History[edit]
Name[edit]
In 1995, Lucent Technologies was spun off from AT&T, and Lucent spun off units of its own in an attempt to restructure its struggling operations.[7]
Development[edit]
In 2001, the Mark Avaya Interaction Center for customer relationship management began, enabling businesses to draw multi-platform call centers to multimedia, multi-site contact centers. The following year, Avaya IP Office and the Avaya Unified Communication Center were introduced. A proposed "converged communications" road map focused on the role which applications would play in making communications improve business performance, and the company managed the communications networks for FIFA World Cup games in Japan and Korea.
In 2003, Avaya MultiVantage communications applications (integrated with Avaya Communications Manager), were introduced. The following year, Avaya's Contact Center Express (the first multimedia contact center designed for medium-sized businesses) was introduced. In 2005 Avaya Voice Portal 3.0 (later Avaya Aura Experience Portal), the company's first software-only voice over IP application platform (IVR plus other automated channels), was introduced.[8] Voice Portal followed the Conversant IVR and Avaya Interactive Response (AvayaIR) IVR as the core of the Avaya Aura Call Center Solution.
In 2006, Louis D'Ambrosio became the company's CEO and president. Avaya one-X Quick Edition, based on emerging SIP-based technology, was introduced and FIFA World Cup games in Germany were carried on an Avaya communications network. The following year, the Avaya Customer Interaction Suite (based on end-to-end SIP) and Avaya Communication Manager 4.0 were introduced.
Acquisition and return to private corporation[edit]
In October 2007, Avaya was acquired by two private-equity firms, TPG Capital and Silver Lake Partners, for $8.2 billion[9][10] and the company was delisted on the New York Stock Exchange.[11] The following year, Avaya Speech to Text (enabling voicemail messages to be read on mobile devices or computers) and Avaya Unified Communications (focusing on role-based communications for teleworkers, home agents, small-business mobile workers, branch-office integration, retail stores and branch banking) were introduced, and Kevin Kennedy became the company's CEO and president.[12]
In 2009, the Avaya Aura for integrated communications was introduced, and in December the company acquired Nortel Enterprise's assets for $900 million.[13] The following year, Avaya was the converged-network equipment supplier for the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, and Avaya Aura Contact Center was introduced. In June 2011, Avaya filed an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to raise up to $1 billion in an initial public offering.[14] On October 4, 2011, the company reported that it was acquiring Sipera Systems for its session border controller (SBC) and unified communications security applications.[15][16] On October 19, 2011, it was reported that Avaya would buy Aurix.[17] Shareholders approved the acquisition of Radvision for about $230 million on April 30, 2012,[18][19] and the deal closed in June.[20]
2013–2015[edit]
Avaya Fabric Connect supported the network backbone at InteropNet 2013, and the company supplied network equipment for the 2014 Winter Olympics.[21] Avaya Stadium, in San Jose, California, opened in 2015.
Bankruptcy (2016–2017)[edit]
According to May 2016 news articles[22] citing "internal sources", Avaya's private-equity owners (Silver Lake Partners and TPG Capital) considered a sale of the company valued at $6 to $10 billion including debt.[23] During the company's earnings call that month, CEO Kevin Kennedy had confirmed that Goldman Sachs was helping Avaya evaluate expressions of interest received relative to specific assets and explore other potential opportunities.[24] In November, Avaya considered chapter 11 bankruptcy while trying to sell its call-center business.[25] On January 19, 2017 Avaya filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11, saying that its foreign operations would be unaffected.[26][27] In its petition, the company listed $5.5 billion in assets and $6.3 billion in debts.[28]
Acquisitions[edit]
Since 2001, Avaya has sold and acquired several companies, including VPNet Technologies, VISTA Information Technologies, Quintus, RouteScience, Tenovis, Spectel, NimCat Networks, Traverse Networks, Ubiquity Software Corporation, Agile Software NZ Limited, Konftel, Sipera, Aurix, Radvision and Esnatech.[29] Through Nortel's bankruptcy proceedings, assets related to their Enterprise Voice and Data business units were auctioned. Avaya placed a $900 million bid, and was announced as the winner of the assets on September 14, 2009.[30][13]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
