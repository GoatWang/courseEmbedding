Re:


WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14

Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C14




 
Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
We have acted as counsel to Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Securities, Inc., a North Carolina corporation (the “Depositor”), in connection with the issuance of approximately $1,469,544,239 aggregate principal balance of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2013-C14, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class A-5, Class A-SB, Class A-S, Class X-A, Class X-B, Class B, Class C and Class PEX Certificates (collectively, the “Registered Certificates”), Class A-3FL, Class A-3FX, Class A-4FL, Class A-4FX, Class X-C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class V and Class R Certificates, pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as of June 1, 2013 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), between the Depositor, as depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as master servicer, U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as certificate administrator, tax administrator and custodian, Rialto Capital Advisors, LLC, as special servicer and Pentalpha Surveillance LLC, as trust advisor.
 
For purposes of rendering this opinion letter, we have reviewed:
 
(i)           the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-172366) relating to the Registered Certificates (the “Registration Statement”), filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Act”), on February 18, 2011, as amended by the Post-Effective Amendment thereto filed with the Commission on January 18, 2013 (the “Post-Effective Amendment”);
 
(ii)          the Prospectus, dated May 13, 2013 (the “Base Prospectus”) and the Prospectus Supplement, dated May 23, 2013 (the “Prospectus Supplement”), relating to the Registered Certificates;

(iii)         the Underwriting Agreement, dated as of May 22, 2013 (the “Underwriting Agreement”), between the Depositor, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,  Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, RBS Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.;
 
(iv)         evidence satisfactory to us with respect to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement (as amended by the Post-Effective Amendment) under the Act; and
 
(v)          the forms of the Registered Certificates attached as exhibits to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
In connection with the foregoing, we have examined originals, or copies certified or otherwise identified to our satisfaction, of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we deemed necessary for the purposes of this opinion letter.  In our examination, we have assumed the following:  (a) the genuineness of all signatures; (b) the legal capacity of natural persons; (c) the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals; (d) the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to us as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of such documents; (e) the conformity of the text of each document filed with the Commission through its Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System to the printed documents reviewed by us; and (f) the truth, accuracy and completeness of the information, representations and warranties contained in the records,
documents, instruments and certificates that we have reviewed.  As to any facts material to the opinions expressed herein that were not known to us, we have relied upon certificates, statements and representations of officers and other representatives of the Depositor and others.
 
Our opinions set forth below are subject to:  (1) general principles of equity, including concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the doctrine of estoppel; (2) the possible unavailability of specific performance and injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; (3) the effect of certain laws, rules, regulations and judicial and other decisions upon enforceability; (4) bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization, liquidation, voidable preference, fraudulent conveyance and transfer, moratorium and other similar laws affecting the rights of creditors or secured parties generally and the effect of, to the extent applicable, the rights of creditors or of secured creditors of national banks or of “financial companies” (as defined in Section 201 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) or their affiliates;
and (5) public policy considerations underlying the securities laws, to the extent that such public policy considerations limit the enforceability of any provision of any agreement that purports or is construed to provide indemnification with respect to securities law violations.

Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that—
 
A.           The Registered Certificates, when duly and validly executed and authenticated in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and when delivered and paid for by the Underwriters pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable and entitled to the benefits provided by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
B.           The descriptions set forth under the caption “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the Base Prospectus and “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the Prospectus Supplement, although they do not discuss all federal income tax consequences that may be applicable to the individual circumstances of particular investors (some of which may be subject to special treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), otherwise correctly describe, as of the date hereof, the material aspects of the federal income tax treatment of an investment in the Registered Certificates commonly applicable to investors that are U.S. Persons (as defined in Annex D attached to the Prospectus Supplement) and, where expressly indicated therein, to investors that are not U.S. Persons.  We also hereby confirm the opinion expressly set forth under such headings as our opinion.
 
We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion letter as an exhibit to the Registration Statement and to the discussion of our opinions set forth in this opinion letter under the headings “Legal Matters” and “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the Base Prospectus and “Legal Matters” and “Material Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the Prospectus Supplement.  In giving such consent, we do not consider that we are “experts”, within the meaning of the term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement, including this opinion letter as an exhibit or otherwise.
 
We express no opinion as to any laws other than the federal laws of the United States of America and the laws of the State of New York.  We do not express any opinion, either implicitly or otherwise, on any issue not expressly addressed above.  We express no opinion with respect to any Series of Certificates for which we do not act as counsel to the Depositor.
 


 



 

Very truly yours,


 
 

 

/s/ Sidley Austin LLP

* The aggregate principal balance of the Class A-3FL and Class 
A-3FX Certificates equals to the balance of the grantor trust, 
A-3FX Regular Interest, initially $55.0 million. 
All or a portion of the Class A-3FL Certificates may be exchanged 
for a like portion of the Class A-3FX Certificates.




** The aggregate principal balance of the Class A-4FL and 
Class A-4FX Certificates equals to the balance of the grantor trust, 
A-4FX Regular Interest, initially $95.0 million. 
All or a portion of the Class A-4FL Certificates may be exchanged 
for a like portion of the Class A-4FX Certificates.




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes, Classes X-A and X-B, 
were affirmed based on the credit performance (or the weighted average 
rating factor or WARF) of their referenced classes.




The rating on the exchangeable class, Class PEX, was affirmed 
based on the weighted average rating factor or WARF of the exchangeable 
classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 3.1% 
of the current balance, compared to 2.3% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 3.0% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 2.3% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
The methodology used in rating the exchangeable Cl. PEX was "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Repackaged Securities" published in June 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only Securities" published in October 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14. 
Please see "Moody's Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only (IO) Securities", which is available 
at www.moodys.com, for more information about the 
implications of the proposed changes to the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
the same as at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 17, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 4% to $1.41 
billion from $1.47 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 72 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans 
constituting 63% of the pool. Two loans, constituting 
less than 1% of the pool, have defeased and are secured by 
US government securities.




Seven loans, constituting 13% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




One loan, constituting less than 1% of the pool, is 
currently in special servicing. The specially serviced loan is 
the BSG Texas Hotel Portfolio Loan ($10.6 million -- 
0.7% of the pool), which is secured by two hotel properties 
in Texas. The largest property is the 73 room La Quinta Inn & 
Suites located in Big Spring, Texas which is approximately 40 miles 
east of Midland. The other property is the 71 room Holiday Inn 
Express located in Graham, Texas which is approximately 120 miles 
northwest of Dallas/Ft. Worth. This loan transferred to 
special servicing in March 2016 due to a significant drop in performance. 
A foreclosure sales occurred in February 2017 and the property is now 
REO.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 89% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 97% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 100%, 
compared to 97% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 18% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.90X and 1.06X, 
respectively, compared to 1.95X and 1.09X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 27% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the RHP Portfolio III Loan ($126.4 million 
-- 9.0% of the pool), which is secured by 12 
manufactured housing communities totaling 3,321 pads located in 
Florida, Utah, New York, Missouri, and Kansas. 
As of year-end 2016, the portfolio's occupancy was 85%, 
the same as at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 113% 
and 0.86X, respectively, compared to 115% and 
0.85X at the last review.




The second largest loan is the Midtown I & II Loan ($124.3 
million -- 8.8% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by two Class A office buildings encompassing 794,110 
SF and an adjacent parking deck located in Atlanta, Georgia. 
The buildings, along with the 47 story AT&T Midtown Tower located 
adjacent to the collateral, serve as AT&T's southern regional 
headquarters. The buildings are 100% leased to AT&T 
Corporation as of year-end 2016, same as at last review. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 104% and 1.09X, 
respectively, the same as at the last review.




The third largest loan is The Plant San Jose Loan ($123.0 
million -- 8.7% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by 485,895 SF portion of a 623,695 SF power center 
approximately two miles south of the San Jose, California central 
business district. The loan sponsor is Cole Credit Property Trust 
IV, Inc. The property was 95% leased as of September 
2016, compared to 91% at the last review. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 88% and 1.08X, respectively, 
the same as at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.

Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14 (WFRBS 2013-C14) Certificates | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14 (WFRBS 2013-C14) 
      Certificates
    





March 23, 2016 04:10 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 19 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      Pass-Through Certificates Series 2013 C14 due to stable performance 
      since issuance. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the March distribution, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 1.8% to $1.44 billion from $1.47 
      billion at issuance. Based on the full year and annualized 2015 reported 
      net operating income (NOI) of the 98.6% of loans, the pool's overall NOI 
      was 8.4% greater than at issuance.
    

      There are currently two specially serviced loans (1.8%) and one 
      additional Fitch Loan of Concern (0.25%). There are six loans on the 
      servicer watchlist, five of which are encountering occupancy and 
      upcoming lease expirations issues that represent minimal risk of 
      property-level cashflow not covering debt service.
    

      Concentrations in the pool include 30.5% full-term interest-only loans 
      and 39.7% partial-term interest-only. The transaction is primarily 
      composed of four real estate sectors encompassing retail (35.9%), office 
      (27.8%), manufactured housing (17.0%), and lodging (12.6%). Given the 
      headline risks to broader economy, Fitch is closely monitoring the 
      performance of retail and hotel properties due to concerns about the 
      health of the US consumer and widespread store consolidation within the 
      retail industry. One loan (0.8%) located in Permian shale basin of 
      central Texas, will be monitored due its dependence on the oil and gas 
      industry.
    

      The largest specially serviced loan, 540 Atlantic Avenue (1.0% of the 
      pool), is a 68,932 square foot office building located in Brooklyn, NY. 
      The loan was transferred to the special servicer in December 2014 after 
      underperforming since issuance due to a tenant not taking possession of 
      a first floor restaurant space. The physical occupancy of the building 
      reached an occupancy low of 61% with a debt service coverage ratio of 
      .83x during early 2014. The sponsor secured two tenants during the 
      second-half of 2014 which raised the economic occupancy to 78% as of 
      December 2014. The sponsor has worked with the servicer to finalize an 
      affiliated lease that would backfill the remaining vacant suite. 
      Additionally, proposals are being reviewed by both parties to cure a 
      number of technical defaults that exist at the property. Fitch will 
      continue the monitor the loan as the special servicer secures more 
      property-level information and resolves the remaining outstanding issues.
    

      The second specially serviced loan, BSG Texas Hotel Portfolio (0.8%), is 
      a portfolio of two properties located in Big Spring and Graham, TX. The 
      loan transferred to the special servicer in early March for imminent 
      monetary default. The larger lodging property consists of 73 units 
      branded as a La Quinta Inn and Suites. The second property consists of 
      71 units branded as a Holiday Inn Express. The hotels are located in the 
      Permian Basin shale region and performance has dipped with the 
      contraction of the energy industry due to lower oil prices. The 
      portfolio's servicer provided 2015 year-end debt-service cost ratio 
      (DSCR) was 1.32x versus 1.83x at issuance and occupancy decreased to 64% 
      as of Dec. 2015 from 78% at issuance.
    

      The Fitch loan of concern is the Crystal Lake Plaza (0.26%), an anchored 
      retail property located in Orlando, FL. The property was fully occupied 
      as of December 2013 with a debt service coverage ratio of 1.75x. A 
      tenant exercised a 2014 lease termination and vacated during the fourth 
      quarter. The sponsor managed to secure a new tenant for the space in 
      2015 and occupancy rebounded to 100% with a DSCR of 1.19x as of Dec. 
      2015. Servicer commentary indicates that the sponsor is self-managing 
      the property without lender consent. The servicer is trying to obtain 
      information on the status of tenants and evaluate property performance. 
      Fitch's analysis was based on a stressed full year 2015 NOI and cap rate.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

      Fitch Affirms WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14 (WFRBS 2013-C14) 
      Certificates
    





April 23, 2014 04:59 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 17 classes of WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 
      2013-C14 certificates due to stable performance since issuance. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the April distribution, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 0.4% to $1.46 billion from $1.47 
      billion at issuance. Based on the annualized 2013 reported net operating 
      income (NOI) of the 79% of loans the reported, the pool's overall NOI 
      has improved 2.7% since issuance.
    

      There are currently no delinquent loans, specially serviced loans or 
      Fitch Loans of Concern. There are three loans on the servicer watchlist 
      for occupancy decreases since issuance. Fitch will continue to monitor 
      the loans for new developments as the master servicer awaits sponsor 
      updates.
    

      RATINGS SENSITIVITY
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Due to the recent 
      issuance of the transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not 
      foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic 
      or asset level event changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics. 
      Additional information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 
      'WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14' (May 14, 2013), available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      The largest loan of the pool is secured by RHP Properties Portfolio III 
      (8.8% of the pool), a portfolio of 12 manufactured housing communities 
      consisting of 3,312 home pads located in five different states. The loan 
      is sponsored by a joint venture of RHP properties and Northstar Realty 
      Finance. RHP has an extensive history of managing manufactured housing 
      communities and is the second largest private owner-operator of the 
      asset class with a total portfolio value in excess of a $1 billion. The 
      properties are primarily located in secondary markets. The communities 
      feature a range of amenities that include playgrounds, swimming pools, 
      and club houses. Performance of the portfolio has historically been 
      stable and the occupancy rate increased 100 basis points since issuance 
      to 86%.
    

      The second largest loan is collateralized by two office buildings 
      consisting of 794,101 square feet (sf) and an adjoining parking garage 
      located in Atlanta, GA. The subject is part of a larger development that 
      serves as the Southeast headquarters for AT&T Inc. and is solely leased 
      to the investment grade corporate entity on a triple-net basis. The 
      buildings are owned by Macfarlan Capital Partners and Cole Real Estate 
      Investment which are sophisticated real estate investors with more than 
      50 million square feet of combined holdings. The subject is optimally 
      located within the Midtown submarket with access to both Interstate 75 
      and 85 along with direct access to the North Avenue MARTA station. The 
      Midtown submarket continues to experience development growth and is an 
      established office market with the additional corporate headquarters of 
      Equifax, Earthlink, Invesco, and The Coca-Cola Company.
    

      The third largest loan is a retail property, The Plant San Jose, 
      collateralized by 485,895 sf of a larger 623,695 sf power center located 
      in San Jose, CA. The subject was developed in 2008 and is leased 
      primarily to national and regional tenants. The loan is sponsored by 
      Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. The property's performance has been 
      strong since opening and is attributable to the limited competition 
      within the market. The nearest power center is located more than four 
      miles from the subject and features a similar tenant roster. Although 
      the tenant base overlaps with the subject, The Plant has a competitive 
      advantage in site layout and proximity to major roadways.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$54.6 million Class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$48.2 million Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

                    Global Credit Research - 22 Oct 2015
                









New York, October 22, 2015 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that Cole/MacFarlan 
of Atlanta GA, LLC, the Sponsor for the Midtown I & II, 
has requested to sell the subject property to Midtown Peachtree SPE, 
LLC, the Proposed borrower, which is indirectly 100% 
owned and controlled by Korea Post. The property consists of two 
office buildings and a parking structure. Midtown One is located 
at 754 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia and Midtown Two is located 
at 725 West Peachtree Street in Atlanta, Georgia. 




CBRE Global Investors will be named the Managing Member of the sole member 
of the Proposed Borrower and manage the asset for Korea Post. Additionally, 
CBRE will assume all of the obligations of the current Guarantors under 
the Guaranty of Recourse Obligations and the Environmental Indemnity Agreement 
and any other Loan Documents that the Guarantor named in the Loan Agreement 
or either of the current Guarantors is a party. The property is 
currently managed by Cole Realty Advisors, Inc., which 
will be replaced by CBRE, Inc. post-closing.




Moody's has reviewed the transaction and has determined that the 
Proposed Sale, Transfer and Loan Assumption will not, in and 
of itself, and at this time, result in a downgrade or withdrawal 
of the current ratings to any class of certificates rated by Moody's 
for the WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with 
the proposed transaction. Moody's is not expressing any opinion 
as to whether this change has, or could have, other noncredit 
related effects that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of 
note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change 
in the ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through 
appropriate media.


This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page on www.moodys.com

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable).

By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision.

Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

Approximately $1.26 Billion of Structured Securities Affected


New York, May 05, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service has affirmed the ratings on sixteen classes 
WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14 as follows: 




Cl. A-1, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on May

Cl. A-S, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on May

Cl. B, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously on May 6, 
2015 Affirmed Aa3 (sf)****


Cl. C, Affirmed A3 (sf); previously on May 6,

Cl. PEX, Affirmed A1 (sf); previously on May 6, 
2015 Affirmed A1 (sf)****


Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aaa (sf); previously on May 
6, 2015 Affirmed Aaa (sf)*


Cl. X-B, Affirmed Aa3 (sf); previously on May 
6, 2015 Affirmed Aa3 (sf)*




*Class X-A and X-B are interest-only classes.




** The aggregate principal balance of the Class A-3FL and 
Class A-3FX Certificates equals to the balance of the grantor trust, 
A-3FX Regular Interest. All or a portion of the Class A-3FL 
Certificates may be exchanged for a like portion of the Class A-3FX 
Certificates.




*** The aggregate principal balance of the Class A-4FL 
and Class A-4FX Certificates equals to the balance of the grantor 
trust, A-4FX Regular Interest. All or a portion of 
the Class A-4FL Certificates may be exchanged for a like portion 
of the Class A-4FX Certificates.




**** The Class A-S, Class B, Class 
PEX, and Class C Certificates are Exchangeable Certificates. 
Class A-S, Class B, and Class C Certificates can be 
exchanged for Class PEX Certificates and Class PEX Certificates can be 
exchanged for Class A-S, Class B, and Class C Certificates, 
in each case as described in the legal documents.




RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the two IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor or WARF) of the referenced classes.




The rating on the one exchangeable class, Class PEX, was affirmed 
based on the weighted average rating factor or WARF of the referenced 
classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 2.3% 
of the current balance, compared to 1.9% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 2.3% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 1.9% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 21, 
compared to 22 at Moody's last review.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 15, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 2% to $1.44 
billion from $1.47 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 73 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 9% of the pool, with the top ten loans 
constituting 62% of the pool. One loan, constituting 
less than 1% of the pool, has defeased and is secured by 
US government securities.




Six loans, constituting 3% of the pool, are on the 
master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes loans 
that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part of the 
CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As part 
of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Two loans, constituting 2% of the pool, are currently 
in special servicing. The largest specially serviced loan is the 
540 Atlantic Avenue Loan ($14.3 million -- 
1.0% of the pool), which is secured by a five-story 
68,900 square foot (SF) Class B office located in Brooklyn, 
New York. The loan transferred to special servicing in December 
2014 due to numerous technical defaults of the loan documents. 
As of September 2014, the property was 78% leased. 
The loan is currently paid thru the March 2016 payment date.




The other specially serviced loan is the BSG Texas Hotel Portfolio Loan 
($10.9 million -- 0.8% of the 
pool), which is secured by two hotel properties in Texas. 
The largest property is the 73 room La Quinta Inn & Suites in Big 
Spring, Texas which is approximately 40 miles east of Midland and 
the remaining property is the 71 room Holiday Inn Express in Graham, 
Texas which is approximately 120 miles northwest of Dallas/Ft. 
Worth. This loan transferred to special servicing in March 2016 
after a large drop in occupancy and RevPAR. Due to the recent transfer, 
the special servicer indicated that a resolution strategy is still being 
formed.




Moody's received full year 2014 operating results for 91% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2015 operating results for 97% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 97%, 
compared to 100% at Moody's last review. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 9% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.95X and 1.09X, 
respectively, compared to 1.89X and 1.05X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The top three conduit loans represent 26% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the RHP Portfolio III Loan ($128.6 million 
-- 8.9% of the pool), which is secured 
by 12 manufactured housing communities totaling 3,321 pads located 
in Florida, Utah, New York, Missouri, and Kansas. 
As of year-end 2015, the portfolio's occupancy was 85%, 
compared to 86% at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed 
DSCR are 115% and 0.85X, respectively, the same 
as at the last review.




The second largest loan is the Midtown I & II Loan ($124.3 
million -- 8.6% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by two Class A office buildings encompassing 794,110 
SF and an adjacent parking deck located in Atlanta, Georgia. 
The buildings, along with the 47 story AT&T Midtown Tower located 
adjacent to the collateral, serve as AT&T's southern regional 
headquarters. The buildings are 100% leased to AT&T 
Corporation as of June 2015, same as at last review. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 104% and 1.09X, respectively, 
the same as at the last review.




The third largest loan is The Plant San Jose Loan ($123.0 
million -- 8.5% of the pool). The loan 
is secured by 485,895 SF of a 623,695 SF power center approximately 
two miles south of the San Jose, California central business district. 
The loan sponsor is Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. The 
property was 91% leased as of September 2015 compared to 93% 
at last review. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 88% and 
1.08X, respectively, the same as at the last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Announcement: Moody's: No ratings impact on WFRBS 2013-C14 and WFRBS 2013-C13 from the Proposed Sale, Transfer and Loan Assumption of 301 College Street Center.






                    Global Credit Research - 30 Mar 2016
                









New York, March 30, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) was informed that WF Property 
Owner, L.P., the Current Borrower, has 
requested the consent of the Lender to the sale of a leasehold interest 
and fee simple title to the real property and the buildings and improvements 
thereon, commonly known as "One Wells Center", 
and assumption of the loan by 301 College Street Center, LLC, 
the Proposed Borrower.




In addition to the sale of the Subject Property and assumption of the 
Loan, the Current Borrower requests the consent of the Lender to 
the following: 1) Replacement of the current carve-out guarantors 
and environmental indemnitors (Starwood Distressed Opportunity Fund IX-1 
U.S.,L.P. and Starwood Distressed Opportunity 
Fund IX Global, L.P.) with the Proposed Guarantors 
(DT GRAT JAT, LLC, DT GRAT LM, LLC, DT GRAT JMT, 
LLC and DT GRAT CS, LLC); and 2) Current Borrower shall assign 
to Proposed Borrower the existing Management and Leasing Agreement, 
between Original Borrower and CK Brokerage Company #2, Limited 
Partnership, previously assigned by CK Brokerage Company #2 
to CK 1WFC Brokerage LLC.




Moody's has reviewed the transaction and has determined that the 
Proposed Sale, Transfer and Loan Assumption will not, in and 
of itself, and at this time, result in a downgrade or withdrawal 
of the current ratings to any class of certificates rated by Moody's 
for WFRBS Commercial Mortgage Trust 2013-C14 and WFRBS Commercial 
Mortgage Trust, Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, 
Series 2013-C13.




Moody's opinion only addresses the credit impact associated with 
the proposed transaction. Moody's is not expressing any opinion 
as to whether this change has, or could have, other noncredit 
related effects that may have a detrimental impact on the interests of 
note holders and/or counterparties.




Moody's will continue to monitor these ratings. Any change 
in the ratings will be publicly disseminated by Moody's through 
appropriate media.






This publication does not announce a credit rating action. For 
any credit ratings referenced in this publication, please see the

To the extent permitted by law, MOODY’S and its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors and suppliers disclaim liability for any direct or compensatory losses or damages caused to any person or entity, including but not limited to by any negligence (but excluding fraud, willful misconduct or any other type of liability that, for the avoidance of doubt, by law cannot be excluded) on the part of, or any contingency within or beyond the control of, MOODY’S or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives, licensors or suppliers, arising from or in connection with the information contained herein or the use of or inability to use any such information. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE ACCURACY, TIMELINESS, COMPLETENESS, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OF ANY SUCH RATING OR OTHER OPINION OR INFORMATION IS GIVEN OR MADE BY MOODY’S IN ANY FORM OR MANNER WHATSOEVER. Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. By continuing to access this document from within Australia, you represent to MOODY’S that you are, or are accessing the document as a representative of, a “wholesale client” and that neither you nor the entity you represent will directly or indirectly disseminate this document or its contents to “retail clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001. MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors. It would be reckless and inappropriate for retail investors to use MOODY’S credit ratings or publications when making an investment decision. If in doubt you should contact your financial or other professional adviser. Additional terms for Japan only: Moody's Japan K.K. (“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000. MJKK and MSFJ also maintain policies and procedures to address Japanese regulatory requirements.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
