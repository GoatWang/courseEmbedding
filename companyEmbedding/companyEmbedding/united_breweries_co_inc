United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) or UB Group is an Indian conglomerate company headquartered in UB City, Bangalore in the state of Karnataka, India.[1] Its core business includes beverages, aviation and investments in various sectors . The company markets beer under the Kingfisher brand, and owns various other brands of alcoholic beverages. It also launched Kingfisher Airlines, an airline in India whose operation has been halted after problems in 2014 that led to its licence being revoked by the DGCA.[2] United Breweries is India's largest producer of beer with a market share of around 52.5% by volume.[3]
The company chairman is Vijay Mallya, who left India on 2 March 2016, allegedly to escape legal action by Indian banks to whom he owes some ₹9,000 crore (US$1.4 billion) in loans. United Breweries now has greater than a 40% share of the Indian brewing market with 79 distilleries and bottling units across the world. Recently, UB financed a takeover of the spirits business of the rival Shaw-Wallace company, giving it a majority share of India's spirits business. The group also owns the Mendocino Brewing Company in the United States.

History[edit]
The UB Group was founded by a Scotsman, Thomas Leishman, in 1857. The Group took its initial lessons in manufacturing beer from South India based British breweries. At the age of 22, Vittal Mallya was elected as the company's first Indian director in 1947. After a year, he replaced R G N Price as the chairman of the company. Rangarajan took over from R G N Price.
United Breweries made its initial impact by manufacturing bulk beer for the British troops before independence, which was transported in huge barrels or "Hogsheads". Kingfisher, the group's most visible and profitable brand, made a modest entry in the sixties. During the 1950s and 60s, the company expanded greatly by acquiring other breweries. First was the addition of McDowell as one of the Group subsidiaries, a move which helped United Breweries to extend its portfolio to wines and spirits business. Strategically, the Group moved into agro-based industries and medicines when Mallya acquired Kissan Products and formed a long-term relationship with Hoechst AG of Germany to create the Indian pharmaceutical company now known as Aventis Pharma, the Indian subsidiary of the global pharma major Sanofi-Aventis.
The logo[edit]
The Pegasus, which is the symbol of the United Breweries, first found its place as the Group logo in 1940. Then, the Helladic horse – associated with beer and nectar in Greek mythology – carried a beer cask between the wings, ostensibly because beer formed the core operations of the Group. Later, the beer cask was removed to represent the Group's multifaceted operations. Now, it is just the horse.
Key Subsidiaries[edit]
United Spirits Limited Sales were expected to exceed 70 million cases during the fiscal year 2005–06, making the Group the third-largest manufacturer of spirits products in the world,[4] after Diageo and Pernod Ricard. In addition, USL is one of only three in the world to own seven millionaire brands and at least five brands rated by Drinks International, UK, to be amongst the ten fastest growing brands in the world in their respective categories. The market share of the Spirits Division in India is currently 60% and exports to the Middle East, Africa and Asian countries are growing rapidly. With plans to become a global player, United Spirits Limited (USL), the flagship of the UB group, purchased the Scottish distiller Whyte and Mackay in May 2007 for £595 million (Rs. 4,800 crore).[5] This would bring the brands of W&M like The Dalmore, Isle of Jura, Glayva, Fettercairn, Vladivar Vodka, and Whyte & Mackay Scotch under its portfolio. However, in October 2014, the UB Group sold its Whyte and Mackay subsidiary to Philippines-based Emperador Inc. for £430m.[6] In 2011, hounded by creditors and with a depleted fleet of aircraft, Vijay Mallya hired Rothschild consultants to raise funding.[7] In 2012 a $2 billion deal is struck with Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company. Part of this payment was received in offshore accounts. According to banking sources, since most of the transaction proceeds were in overseas accounts, it was not possible for them to seize them. Needless to say the money was not used to repay loans to Indian banks in 2012 which lent Rs 7,200 crore to Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines. Later a sweetheart exit deal was brokered between Mallya and Diageo where $75 million were paid to Vijay Mallya to step down as chairman of United Spirits.[7] In 2012, Diageo acquired a 55% stake in United Spirits.[8]
United Breweries Limited The UB Group's brewing entity – called United Breweries Limited (UBL) – has also assumed undisputed market leadership with a national market share in excess of 50%. Through a process of aggressive acquisition and market penetration, The UB Group today controls 60% of the total manufacturing capacity for beer in India. The flagship brand, Kingfisher, is now sold in over 52 countries worldwide, having received many accolades for its quality. As of March 2016, United Breweries was 43%-owned by Heineken.[9]
Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers The UB group also manufactures fertilizers. The group company Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF) has a factory at New Mangalore in Karnataka.
UB Engineering UB Engineering Limited is the group's engineering business arm. It undertakes engineering, procurement and construction projects, infrastructure, on-site fabrication of structures, installation, testing and commissioning of electrical and mechanical equipment, piping for large industrial projects. The company was initially established as Western India Erectors in 1963 and came under the UB Group in 1988.
UBICS UBICS, Inc provides IT consulting, bodyshopping services and professional IT products to business companies. In August 1999, the group made a first-of-its-kind media alliance for the promotion of NDTV Good Times, a lifestyle television channel run by NDTV.

United Spirits Limited Sales were expected to exceed 70 million cases during the fiscal year 2005–06, making the Group the third-largest manufacturer of spirits products in the world,[4] after Diageo and Pernod Ricard. In addition, USL is one of only three in the world to own seven millionaire brands and at least five brands rated by Drinks International, UK, to be amongst the ten fastest growing brands in the world in their respective categories. The market share of the Spirits Division in India is currently 60% and exports to the Middle East, Africa and Asian countries are growing rapidly. With plans to become a global player, United Spirits Limited (USL), the flagship of the UB group, purchased the Scottish distiller Whyte and Mackay in May 2007 for £595 million (Rs. 4,800 crore).[5] This would bring the brands of W&M like The Dalmore, Isle of Jura, Glayva, Fettercairn, Vladivar Vodka, and Whyte & Mackay Scotch under its portfolio. However, in October 2014, the UB Group sold its Whyte and Mackay subsidiary to Philippines-based Emperador Inc. for £430m.[6] In 2011, hounded by creditors and with a depleted fleet of aircraft, Vijay Mallya hired Rothschild consultants to raise funding.[7] In 2012 a $2 billion deal is struck with Diageo, the world’s largest spirits company. Part of this payment was received in offshore accounts. According to banking sources, since most of the transaction proceeds were in overseas accounts, it was not possible for them to seize them. Needless to say the money was not used to repay loans to Indian banks in 2012 which lent Rs 7,200 crore to Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines. Later a sweetheart exit deal was brokered between Mallya and Diageo where $75 million were paid to Vijay Mallya to step down as chairman of United Spirits.[7] In 2012, Diageo acquired a 55% stake in United Spirits.[8]
United Breweries Limited The UB Group's brewing entity – called United Breweries Limited (UBL) – has also assumed undisputed market leadership with a national market share in excess of 50%. Through a process of aggressive acquisition and market penetration, The UB Group today controls 60% of the total manufacturing capacity for beer in India. The flagship brand, Kingfisher, is now sold in over 52 countries worldwide, having received many accolades for its quality. As of March 2016, United Breweries was 43%-owned by Heineken.[9]
Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers The UB group also manufactures fertilizers. The group company Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilizers (MCF) has a factory at New Mangalore in Karnataka.
UB Engineering UB Engineering Limited is the group's engineering business arm. It undertakes engineering, procurement and construction projects, infrastructure, on-site fabrication of structures, installation, testing and commissioning of electrical and mechanical equipment, piping for large industrial projects. The company was initially established as Western India Erectors in 1963 and came under the UB Group in 1988.
UBICS UBICS, Inc provides IT consulting, bodyshopping services and professional IT products to business companies. In August 1999, the group made a first-of-its-kind media alliance for the promotion of NDTV Good Times, a lifestyle television channel run by NDTV.

United Breweries Holdings Limited (UBHL) or UB Group is an Indian conglomerate company headquartered in UB City, Bangalore in the state of Karnataka, India.[1] Its core business includes beverages, aviation and investments in various sectors . The company markets beer under the Kingfisher brand, and owns various other brands of alcoholic beverages. It also launched Kingfisher Airlines, an airline in India whose operation has been halted after problems in 2014 that led to its licence being revoked by the DGCA.[2] United Breweries is India's largest producer of beer with a market share of around 52.5% by volume.[3]
The company chairman is Vijay Mallya, who left India on 2 March 2016, allegedly to escape legal action by Indian banks to whom he owes some ₹9,000 crore (US$1.4 billion) in loans. United Breweries now has greater than a 40% share of the Indian brewing market with 79 distilleries and bottling units across the world. Recently, UB financed a takeover of the spirits business of the rival Shaw-Wallace company, giving it a majority share of India's spirits business. The group also owns the Mendocino Brewing Company in the United States.

History[edit]
The UB Group was founded by a Scotsman, Thomas Leishman, in 1857. The Group took its initial lessons in manufacturing beer from South India based British breweries. At the age of 22, Vittal Mallya was elected as the company's first Indian director in 1947. After a year, he replaced R G N Price as the chairman of the company. Rangarajan took over from R G N Price.
United Breweries made its initial impact by manufacturing bulk beer for the British troops before independence, which was transported in huge barrels or "Hogsheads". Kingfisher, the group's most visible and profitable brand, made a modest entry in the sixties. During the 1950s and 60s, the company expanded greatly by acquiring other breweries. First was the addition of McDowell as one of the Group subsidiaries, a move which helped United Breweries to extend its portfolio to wines and spirits business. Strategically, the Group moved into agro-based industries and medicines when Mallya acquired Kissan Products and formed a long-term relationship with Hoechst AG of Germany to create the Indian pharmaceutical company now known as Aventis Pharma, the Indian subsidiary of the global pharma major Sanofi-Aventis.
The logo[edit]
The Pegasus, which is the symbol of the United Breweries, first found its place as the Group logo in 1940. Then, the Helladic horse – associated with beer and nectar in Greek mythology – carried a beer cask between the wings, ostensibly because beer formed the core operations of the Group. Later, the beer cask was removed to represent the Group's multifaceted operations. Now, it is just the horse.

United Breweries Co Inc Stock Downgraded (CCU)






TheStreet Wire




Kevin Baker

  Editor's Note: Any reference to TheStreet Ratings and its underlying recommendation does not reflect the opinion of TheStreet, Inc. or any of its contributors including Jim Cramer or Stephanie Link.  NEW YORK ( TheStreet) -- United Breweries (NYSE: CCU) has been downgraded by TheStreet Ratings from buy to hold. The company's strengths can be seen in multiple areas, such as its largely solid financial position with reasonable debt levels by most measures, reasonable valuation levels and expanding profit margins. However, as a counter to these strengths, we also find weaknesses including feeble growth in the company's earnings per share, deteriorating net income and disappointing return on equity.   EXCLUSIVE OFFER: Jim Cramer's Protégé, Dave Peltier, only buys Stocks Under $10 that he thinks could potentially double. See what he's trading today with a 14-day FREE pass.   Highlights from the ratings report include:   CCU's debt-to-equity ratio is very low at 0.19 and is currently below that of the industry average, implying that there has been very successful management of debt levels.   The gross profit margin for COMPANIA CERVECERIAS UNIDAS is rather high; currently it is at 60.36%. Regardless of CCU's high profit margin, it has managed to decrease from the same period last year. Despite the mixed results of the gross profit margin, the net profit margin of 12.11% trails the industry average.   The company, on the basis of change in net income from the same quarter one year ago, has underperformed when compared to that of the S&P 500 and the Beverages industry average. The net income has decreased by 13.6% when compared to the same quarter one year ago, dropping from $85.43 million to $73.79 million.   Current return on equity is lower than its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of weakness within the company. When compared to other companies in the Beverages industry and the overall market, COMPANIA CERVECERIAS UNIDAS's return on equity is below that of both the industry average and the S&P 500.    Compania Cervecerias Unidas S.A., through its subsidiaries, produces, bottles, sells, and distributes beverages primarily in Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
United Breweries Co Inc's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0/677.098361151*91


=0.00



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, United Breweries Co Inc's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
United Breweries Co Inc's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=229.881085323-1172.48060846+0.75 * 0+0.5 * 0


=-943



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I recently ordered a book from Research and Markets via their website. Shortly after ordering the book

                         I received a message from the Research and Markets Orders Department stating that payment had not been received for the book. My first thought was credit card fraud. I called Orders Department and was connected immediately with Maria O’Toole. Maria was extremely helpful in resolving the payment question. Maria suggested that since Research and Markets is located in Dublin, Ireland and I am located in Seattle, Washington, my credit card company might have placed a hold on the payment. I checked with my card company and this was indeed the case. I corrected the hold on the payment and informed Maria. Maria confirmed that the payment transaction had been completed and assured me that the book would be delivered in a timely manner. 

I truly appreciate the ease with which I was able to contact a live person quickly and resolve the issue easily. I highly recommend Research and Markets for their depth and breadth of research materials and their excellent customer service.
