	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Englewood attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

Christine has loved the law since a rather young age.  Her career, though varied, has one theme: helping others, especially victims of crime. Christine opened her law practice and chose to exclusively handle US immigration law for two reasons. First: her own experience with the US immigration system because she and her husband adopted their daughter. During that long process, she lived through – and survived! – the very same immigration system her clients do today. Several parallels can be drawn between her family and her clients’ families. Like so many of her clients, she brought her child to...

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire. 



Researching Attorney Discipline

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

History

Information
Tasting Notes



			                Paul John single malt whiskies are the masterful creations of John Distilleries Ltd. JDL was established in 1992, by Mr. Paul P. John, who had a vision for creating a quality, premium, international single malt. Most Indian whisky is not distilled from the usual grains that Scotch whisky drinkers are accustomed, rum drinkers are more than likely to be more accustomed, as it is distilled from a molasses base.

But Mr. Paul P. John had the vision of bringing a single malt to the market that would captivate even the most cutthroat whisky connoisseurs. Under the guidance of Master Distiller Michael D’Souza, John embarked on a journey to create, 'The Great Indian Single Malt.'

Paul John’s single malt whisky hails from the southwestern Indian state of Goa. As one of the 3 biggest Whisky producers in India, JDL launched their single malt in 2008 and made their full line of whiskies available to US markets in 2016. 

Their Indian barley, sourced from the foothills of the Himalayan mountains, yields less alcohol than its European counterpart, but is said to have a much higher flavor profile. The whisky is matured in a tropical climate, which results in over 20% of the whisky being evaporated each year. This climate is what makes Indian whisky mature faster than their Scotch counterparts

JDL has a highly acclaimed and diverse portfolio, including its flagship brand Original Choice Whisky, which sells over 10 million cases a year. They also produce a brand of Brandy (Mônt Castlé, Roulette), and Wine (Big Banyan, Goana’s). Paul Johns 'Edited' whisky is an Indian single malt crafted by Master Distiller Michael John using Indian 6-row barley and Scottish barley. 

The single malt mixture contains 15% spirit peated at 20-25ppm, giving the final product a sweet and spicy character, with a balanced smokiness. The single malt then gets its rest in bourbon casks. This expression won Gold for the single malt category at the Wizards of Whisky Awards.

Beautiful nose filled with aromas of port, candied cherries, vanilla and strawberry jam. The palate is equally as enthralling, with notes of cinnamon and nutmeg mingling with orange peel and anise before leading to a long, dry and oaky finish.

Product Description
Paul John Edited Indian Whisky.
Paul John Edited Indian Whisky is a Peated Single Malt Whisky from the John Distilleries.
TASTING NOTES:
Nose: chocolate mint evolves from the delicate peats which sit beautifully with the lesser oaky theme; a comfortable, yet always complex, nose with the smoke soft and relaxed and refusing to bully the juicier barley;
Taste: grassy barley shows first, then slowly gives way as those most gentle peat notes dissolve onto the palate and begins to build momentum and intensity.
Again there is a chocolate mint/mocha theme, as well as a sublime mollassed note which injects all the sweetness required;
Finish: long, helped by to-die-for oils, some hints of spice and now some tannins, plus the vanilla. But all is beautifully weighted, patient and poised; Oh, and did I mention the chocolate mint…?
Balance : a new Indian classic: a sublime malt from the subcontinent. To be more precise: a world classic!
Think of Ardmore at its most alluring: one of Scotland’s finest and most complex single malts, yet somehow possessing a saltiness and depth more befitting Islay.
Then stir in a small degree of Ulmo honey and bourbon-style hickory and liquorice. Plus subtle chocolate mint. And there you have it…the smoke drifting around stirring up spicy tales of the east.
A world class whisky to be talked about with reverence without doubt.
Indian Single Malt whisky, with a hint of peat. Matured in ex-bourbon casks. Distilled in traditional copper pot stills in Goa, India. Non chill-filtered. Non coloured.
Award Winning Whisky:
Wizards Of Whisky Awards, 2017 and 2016, Silver.
Malt Maniacs Awards, 2016, Bronze.
