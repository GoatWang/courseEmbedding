(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Certain statements made or incorporated by reference in this report and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in statements made by or with the approval of authorized personnel constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to the safe harbor created thereby. Forward looking statements reflect intent, belief, current expectations, estimates or projections about, among other things, our industry, management's beliefs, and future events and financial trends affecting us. Words such as "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "plans," "believes," "seeks," "estimates," "may," "will" and variations of these words or similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward looking statements. Although we believe the expectations reflected in any forward looking statements are reasonable, such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, our actual results could differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements as a result of various factors. These differences can arise as a result of the risks described above in the section entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this report, as well as other factors that may affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Forward looking statements in this report speak only as of the date hereof, and forward looking statements in documents incorporated by reference speak only as of the date of those documents. Unless otherwise required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise these forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. In light of these risks and uncertainties, we cannot assure you that the forward looking statements contained in this report will, in fact, transpire.  Overview  The management's discussion and analysis is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions.  Our Business  Genius Brands International, Inc. is a global content and brand management company that creates and licenses multimedia content. Led by industry veterans, we distribute our content in all formats as well as a broad range of consumer products based on its characters. In the children's media sector, our portfolio features "content with a purpose" for toddlers to tweens, which provides enrichment as well as entertainment, including tween music-driven brand SpacePop; Rainbow Rangers, a girls mission-based adventure series; preschool property debuting on Netflix Llama Llama; award-winning Baby Genius, re-launched with new entertainment and over 40 new products; adventure comedy Thomas Edison's Secret Lab(R), available on Netflix, public broadcast stations and our Kid Genius Cartoon Channel on Comcast's Xfinity on Demand; Warren Buffett's Secret Millionaires Club, created with and starring iconic investor Warren Buffett. We are also co-producing an all-new adult-themed animated series, Stan Lee's Cosmic Crusaders, with Stan Lee's Pow! Entertainment and The Hollywood Reporter.  In addition, we act as licensing agent for certain brands, leveraging our existing licensing infrastructure to expand these brands into new product categories, new retailers, and new territories. These include Llama Llama; From Frank, a humor greeting card and product line; and Celessence Technologies, the world's leading microencapsulation company.  Recent Events  Warrant Exercise  On February 9, 2017, we entered into a private transaction (the "Private Transaction") pursuant to a Warrant Exercise Agreement (the "Agreement") with certain holders of our existing warrants (the "Original Warrants"). The Original Warrants were originally issued on November 3, 2015, to purchase an aggregate of 1,443,362 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), at an exercise price of $3.30 per share and were to expire on November 3, 2020.  Pursuant to the Agreement, the holders of the Original Warrants and we agreed that such Original Warrant holders would exercise their Original Warrants in full and we would issue to each such holder new warrants, with the new warrants being identical to the Original Warrants except that the termination date of such new warrants is February 10, 2022 (the "Reload Warrants"). In addition, depending on the number of Original Warrants exercised by all holders of the Original Warrants, we also agreed to issue to the holders another new warrant, identical to the Original Warrant except that the exercise price of such warrant is $5.30 and such warrant is not exercisable until August 10, 2017 (the "Market Price Warrants" and together with the Reload Warrants, the "New Warrants").  We received gross proceeds of $3,866,573 from the exercise of the Original Warrants and issued Reload Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 799,991 shares of our Common Stock and Market Price Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 371,699 shares of our Common Stock.  Chardan Capital Markets LLC acted as financial advisor on the Private Transaction in consideration for which it received $363,617 and was issued New Warrants for 115,000 shares of Common Stock.  Distribution Agreement with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Inc.  On February 18, 2016, we entered into a distribution agreement ("Distribution Agreement") with Sony Pictures Home Entertainment Inc. ("Sony"), pursuant to which we agreed to grant Sony certain rights for the marketing and distribution of our animated feature-length motion pictures and animated television series in the United States and Canada, and potentially additional countries. In consideration for such rights, and subject to certain conditions, Sony has paid us an advance in the amount of $2.0 million, against future royalties.  On January 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment of our home entertainment distribution agreement with Sony pursuant to which, among other things, Sony agreed to pay $1,489,583 which was owed and payable by us to Sony's sister company Sony DADC US Inc. ("DADC") for certain disk manufacturing and replication services.  In connection with such transaction, we issued Sony 301,231 shares of our Common Stock at $4.945 per share, Sony's exclusive territory for exercising its home entertainment distribution rights under the Distribution Agreement was extended from the United States and Canada to worldwide, and the amount of advances subject to recoupment by Sony out of royalty payments that would otherwise be due to us under the Distribution Agreement was increased by the amount of the payment to DADC. Future cash flow from the distributed products under the distribution agreement, if any, will be impacted by the additional recoupment obligation. In connection with the above issuance of our shares, we entered into a subscription agreement with Sony, effective as of January 17, 2017.  Results of Operations  Our summary results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are below.  Revenues Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Change % Change Licensing & Royalties $ 469,527 $ 492,134 $ (22,607 ) -5% Television & Home Entertainment 356,150 400,676 (44,526 ) -11% Advertising Sales 27,330 - 27,330 N/A Product Sales 13,868 15,173 (1,305 ) -9% Total Revenue $ 866,875 $ 907,983 $ (41,108 ) -5%  Licensing and royalty revenue includes items for which we license the rights to our copyrights and trademarks of our brands and those of the brands for which we act as a licensing agent. During the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015, this category decreased $22,607 or 5% primarily due to the transition from one distribution partner to another.  Television & Home Entertainment revenue is generated from distribution of our properties for broadcast on television, VOD, or SVOD in domestic and international markets and the sale of DVDs for home entertainment through our partners. During the year ended December 31, 2016, Television & Home Entertainment revenue decreased $44,526 or 11% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to deliveries of Thomas Edison's Secret Lab commencing in the third quarter of 2015 without comparable activity in the latter half of 2016.  Advertising sales are generated on the Kid Genius Cartoon Channel in the form of either flat rate promotions or advertising impressions served. Advertising sales increased by $27,330 during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to zero revenue in the prior period as we began to monetize our growing base of homes served.  Product sales represent physical products including DVDs and CDs in which we hold intellectual property rights such as trademarks and copyrights to the characters and which are manufactured and sold by us either directly at wholesale to retail stores or online retailers. During the year ended December 31, 2016, product sales decreased by $1,305 or 9% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.  Total Expenses Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Change % Change Marketing and Sales $ 1,035,128 $ 420,399 $ 614,729 146% Direct Operating Costs 279,217 200,418 78,799 39% General and Administrative 6,017,391 3,823,510 2,193,881 57% Total Expenses $ 7,331,736 $ 4,444,327 $ 2,887,409 65%  Marketing and sales expenses increased $614,729 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to promotional and branding activity related to the June 2016 debut of SpacePop on YouTube and in preparation for its launch at retail locations in the fourth quarter of 2016 as well as an increase in trade show expenses related to our promotion of our brands at MIPCOM in the Fall of 2016.  Direct operating costs include costs of our product sales, unamortizable post-production costs, film and television cost amortization expense, and participation expense related to agreements with various animation studios, post-production studios, writers, directors, musicians or other creative talent with which we are obligated to share net profits of the properties on which they have rendered services. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded film and television cost amortization expense of $167,788 and participation expense of $17,238 compared to prior period expenses of $127,552 and $0, respectively. These increases are primarily due to our continued exploitation of Thomas Edison's Secret Lab.  General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, employee benefits, share-based compensation related to stock options, insurances, rent, depreciation and amortization as well as other professional fees related to finance, accounting, legal and investor relations. General and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $2,193,881 compared to the same period in 2015. This increase includes: (i) increases in share-based compensation expense of $1,549,878 related to the grant of options to officers, directors, employees and consultants in the fourth quarter of 2015 and in 2016;  Other Income / (Expense) Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Change % Change Other Income $ 6,651 $ 18,870 $ (12,219 ) -65% Interest Expense (2,675 ) (2,576 ) (99 ) 4% Interest Expense - Related Parties (8,503 ) (24,757 ) 16,254 -66% Gain / (Loss) on Distribution Contracts 258,103 115,811 142,292 123% Gain / (Loss) on Impairment of Assets (1,850 ) (7,500 ) 5,650 -75% Gain / (Loss) on Deferred Financing Costs - (9,313 ) 9,313 -100% Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Translation - (37,313 ) 37,313 -100% Net Other Income (Expense) $ 251,726 $ 53,222 $ 198,504 373%  Other income (expense) represents non-operating income and expense such as interest expense and the gain or loss on certain transactions as well as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments related to certain contracts denominated in foreign currency. For the year ended December 31, 2016, other income totaled $251,726 compared to $53,222 in the prior period. This $198,504 increase was primarily due to the $275,000 settlement of a distribution agreement with limited comparable activity in the prior period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Working Capital  At December 31, 2016, we had current assets of $3,376,788, including cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $2,887,921 and current liabilities of $3,856,192, including certain trade payables of $925,000 to which we dispute the claim and a service advance of $1,489,583 payable to DADC, resulting in a working capital deficit of $479,404, representing a decrease of $3,304,755 from working capital of $2,825,351 as of December 31, 2015.  Subsequent to the end of the period, on January 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment of our home entertainment distribution agreement with Sony pursuant to which, among other things, Sony agreed to pay $1,489,583 which was owed and payable by us to DADC. On a proforma basis, had the transaction closed during 2016, our working capital balance would have been $1,010,179 representing a $1,815,172 decrease from the prior year.  Credit Facility  On August 8, 2016, Llama Productions LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary, closed a $5,275,000 multiple draw-down, secured, non-recourse, non-revolving credit facility (the "Facility") with Bank Leumi USA for the production of our animated series Llama Llama (the "Series"). The Series is configured as fifteen half-hour episodes comprised of thirty 11 minute programs to be delivered to Netflix in Fall 2017. The Facility is secured by the license fees we will receive from Netflix for the delivery of the Series as well as our copyright in the Series. The Facility has a term of 40 months and has an interest rate of either Prime plus 1% or one, three, or six month LIBOR plus 3.25%. As a condition of the loan agreement with Bank Leumi, we deposited $1,000,000 into a cash account to be used solely for the production of the series.  Comparison of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 Our total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash was $2,887,921 and $5,187,620 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in cash is as follows: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 Change Cash used in operations $ (3,716,277 ) $ (3,396,581 ) $ (319,696 ) Cash used in investing activities (11,494 ) (294,207 ) 282,713 Cash provided by financing activities 1,428,072 4,577,309 (3,149,237 ) Increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (2,299,699 ) $ 886,521 $ (3,186,220 )  During the year ended December 31, 2016, our primary source of cash was the $2.0 million advance from Sony in the first quarter of 2016 coupled with financing activities including the proceeds from the exercise of warrants as well as proceeds from the Llama Llama production facility. During the comparable period in 2015, our primary source of cash was financing activity including the collection of the second payment related to a long-term, exclusive supply chain services contract. During both periods, these funds were primarily used to fund operations including the continued investment in our film and television assets as well as marketing support for our brands.  Operating Activities  Cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,716,277 as compared to a use of $3,396,581 during the prior period, representing additional cash used by operating activities of $319,696 based on the operating results discussed above as well as the receipt of the $2.0 million advance from Sony offset by film and television costs related to the development and production of SpacePop, Llama Llama,Rainbow Rangers, and Stan Lee's Cosmic Crusaders.  Investing Activities  Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $11,494 as compared to a use of $294,207 for the comparable period in 2015, representing a decrease in cash used in investing activities of $282,713. This decrease is primarily the result of approximately $180,000 spent on leasehold improvements in our leased office space in the first quarter of 2015 and as well as the development expenditures for certain intangible assets without comparable activity in 2016.  Financing Activities  Cash generated from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1,428,072 as compared to $4,577,309 generated in the comparable period in 2015 representing a decrease of $3,149,237.  During the first quarter of 2014, we entered into a long-term, exclusive supply chain services agreement in which we agreed to order a minimum level of disk replication, packaging and distribution services for our content across all physical media. As consideration for these minimum order levels, we received a total of $1,500,000, $750,000 during the first quarter of 2014 and $750,000 during the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 2015, we conducted a private placement with certain accredited investors pursuant to which it sold an aggregate of 1,443,362 shares of its Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,443,362 shares of Common Stock for a purchase price of $3.00 per share and associated warrant for net proceeds of $3,872,782.  During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash generated from financing activities related to $110,000 received from the exercise of certain outstanding warrants as well as draw-downs on the Llama production facility.  Capital Expenditures  As of December 31, 2016, we do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.  Critical Accounting Policies  Our accounting policies are described in the notes to the financial statements. Below is a summary of the critical accounting policies, among others, that management believes involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements.  Principles of Consolidation  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Genius Brands International, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries A Squared and Llama Productions as well as its interest in Stan Lee Comics, LLC ("Stan Lee Comics"). All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Goodwill and Intangible Assets  Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for by the purchase method. In accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other, goodwill and certain intangible assets are presumed to have indefinite useful lives and are thus not amortized, but subject to an impairment test annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We complete the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests at the end of each fiscal year. To test for goodwill impairment, we are required to estimate the fair market value of each of our reporting units, of which we have one. While we may use a variety of methods to estimate fair value for impairment testing, our primary method is discounted cash flows. We estimate future cash flows and allocations of certain assets using estimates for future growth rates and our judgment regarding the applicable discount rates. Changes to our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair market value of the reporting units, which could result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets in future periods.  Other intangible assets have been acquired, either individually or with a group of other assets, and were initially recognized and measured based on fair value. In accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangible Assets, the costs of new product development and significant improvement to existing products are capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred. Annual amortization of these intangible assets is computed based on the straight-line method over the remaining economic life of the asset.  Film and Television Costs  We capitalize production costs for episodic series produced in accordance with FASB ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue based on the initial market revenue evidenced by a firm commitment over the period of commitment. We expense all capitalized costs that exceed the initial market firm commitment revenue in the period of delivery of the episodes.  We capitalize production costs for films produced in accordance with FASB ASC 926-20 Entertainment-Films - Other Assets - Film Costs. Accordingly, production costs are capitalized at actual cost and then charged against revenue quarterly as a cost of production based on the relative fair value of the film(s) delivered and recognized as revenue. We evaluate its capitalized production costs annually and limits recorded amounts by their ability to recover such costs through expected future sales.  Additionally, for both episodic series and films, from time to time, we develop additional content, improved animation and bonus songs/features for its existing content. After the initial release of the film or episodic series, the costs of significant improvement to existing products are capitalized while routine and periodic alterations to existing products are expensed as incurred.  Revenue Recognition  We recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 926-605 Entertainment-Films - Revenue Recognition. Accordingly, we recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a sale with a customer exists, (ii) the film is complete and has been delivered or is available for delivery, (iii) the license period of the arrangement has begun and the customer can begin its exploitation, exhibition, or sale, (iv) the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable, and (v) collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured.  Our licensing and royalty revenue represents revenue generated from license agreements that are held in conjunction with third parties that are responsible for collecting fees due and remitting to us our share after expenses. Revenue from licensed products is recognized when realized or realizable based on royalty reporting received from licensees. Licensing income that we recognize as an agent is in accordance with FASB ASC 605-45 Revenue Recognition - Principal Agent. Accordingly, our revenue is our gross billings to its customers less the amounts we pay to suppliers for their products and services.  We sell advertising on our Kid Genius channel in the form of either flat rate promotions or impressions served. For flat rate promotions with a fixed term, we recognize revenue when all five revenue recognition criteria under FASB ASC 606 are met. For impressions served, we deliver a certain minimum number of impressions on the channel to the advertiser for which the advertiser pays a contractual CPM per impression. Impressions served are reported to us on a monthly basis, and revenue will be reported in the month the impressions are served.  We recognize revenue related to product sales when (i) the seller's price is substantially fixed, (ii) shipment has occurred causing the buyer to be obligated to pay for product, (iii) the buyer has economic substance apart from the seller, and (iv) there is no significant obligation for future performance to directly bring about the resale of the product by the buyer as required by FASB ASC 605 Revenue Recognition.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g. insurance contracts). This ASU will supersede all revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, and industry-specific guidance throughout the industry topics of the codification. The guidance's core principle is that an entity . . .  Mar 31, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Predecessor companies[edit]
A2 Squared Background[edit]
A couple of future A Squared Entertainment properties originated at Andy Heyward's previous company, DIC Entertainment. DIC signed a TV series production deal in July 2003 with Stan Lee's POW! Entertainment for Stan Lee's Secret Super Six property.[1] While in 2006, DIC was in development on Secret Millionaires Club with Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett.[2]
A Squared Entertainment[edit]
A Squared Entertainment (A2, A Squared) was formed by Heyward and his wife, Amy Moynihan Heyward, in 2009 as an animation company. The company had an initial four show celebrity-inspired cartoon slate to be seen on AOL starting in Q4 2009 with the last starting in 2010. The four shows would then switch from a webisode format of 26 episodes of three-to-five-minute to TV with 13 22-minute shows. The slate then consisted of Secret Millionaires Club, GiGi and The Green Team (working title), Little Martha (working title) and Kosmos. Kosmos was a series to be based on Carl Sagan's life as a famous astronomer.[3] A2's first animated program was Secret Millionaires Club, which features an animated Buffett as a secret mentor to a group of enterprising children. Also, Martha & Friends with Martha Stewart and Gisele & the Green Team with Gisele Bundchen were created and launched by A Square.[4]
In February 2010, A2 partnered with POW! Entertainment and Archie Comics to create the Stan Lee Comics joint venture for the Stan Lee's Super Seven franchise.[5] On December 7, 2010, A Squared in conjunction with AOLkids.com and Gisele Bündchen launched Gisele & The Green Team webseries.[6]
In April 2012, Stan Lee's Mighty 7 was slated to be developed into other media formats via A Squared Elxsi Entertainment LLC (A2E2). A2E2 was a joint-venture between A Squared Entertainment (A2) and Tata Elxsi[7] formed in January 2011 which Elxsi ends in October 2012.[8] Also in 2012, A2 took over Archies' ownership stake in Stan Lee Comics.[9]
By November 2013, A2 had Thomas Edison's Secret Lab in development.[4]

Issues Shareholder LetterMarketwiredMay 3, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareHeadquartered in Beverly Hills, CA, Genius Brands International, Inc. (NASDAQ: GNUS) is a leading media company that creates, produces and licenses children's multimedia entertainment content and products for global broadcast, digital and retail distribution.Click here for high-resolution versionMoreBEVERLY HILLS, CA--(Marketwired - May 03, 2017) - Genius Brands International (GNUS) recently released a letter to shareholders from Chairman & CEO Andy Heyward. The complete letter follows:Dear Shareholders and Friends,Last week, Genius Brands made an important announcement regarding our upcoming animated series RAINBOW RANGERS and the team that will now be bringing this to the global marketplace.Rainbow Rangers will be important because:The #1 ranked kids network, Nickelodeon, will be the broadcaster.The #1 toy company in the world, Mattel, will be the master toy license.The #1 creative team assembled for animated television series created by Rob Minkoff, the director of Disney's Lion King, Shane Morris, the co-writer of Disney's Frozen, and Show Run by Elise Allen, the Emmy nominated writer currently doing Disney Channel's Lion King spinoff, Lion Guard. (I don't make such a statement lightly, but to the best of my knowledge there has never been a team with the mega hit Disney animated motion picture pedigree of this stature, which has come together to create a new brand).In addition to this 'winning tripod,' we have been joined by Shelly Hirsch as Co-Executive Producer. Shelly is the founder and CEO of Beacon Media, the largest children's media buying service in the U.S. Shelly will be a Co-Executive Producer of the series, along with myself. The significance of Shelly Hirsch as part of our Rainbow Rangers series is the huge strategic insight that Shelly brings to the table in successful content distribution and consumer product licensing. As the single largest spender of kids media dollars, Shelly is the foremost authority on what makes kid's programs succeed and their licensing business explode. The tactics which Shelly will help engineer to maximize the success of Rainbow Rangers cannot be overstated.Since announcing RAINBOW RANGERS' pickup last week by Nickelodeon, we have been contacted by licensees of product across all the major categories, from publishing to apparel and all points in between. The licensing community quickly smells a hot property, and our expectations are that we will have deals written in virtually every major category with the tiffany licensees in each category by end of Licensing Show in Las Vegas at the end of this month. In October, we will be exhibiting Rainbow Rangers at Brand Licensing Europe in London, and we expect similar results from the international licensee community, for those categories where we have not already done global licenses.I share this with you because in the kid's content business, RAINBOW RANGERS represents the 'perfect storm.'Best in Class, creativeBest in Class, distributionBest in Class, master toy licenseBest in Class, licensee base This means that we expect the property will be on air and on shelf with content and consumer products in virtually every major category, including toys, electronics, video games, apparel, publishing, music, stationary, party goods, school supplies, backpacks, bedding, costumes, role play, and confections to name a few. Strawberry Shortcake had over 300 licensees globally, and ultimately did $5 BILLION DOLLARS OF RETAIL SALES. Each and every licensee pays an $advance and provides a monetary guarantee for the rights to license our characters and put it on their products. With every single item of every single product sold, a percentage of the sale price is paid to Genius Brands as a royalty.Of course nobody can guarantee what property becomes the next billion dollar brand. Nevertheless, every year there is another Power Rangers, another Strawberry Shortcake, another Ninja Turtles, Pokemon, Barney, or Paw Patrol. We think that Rainbow Rangers has every chance to become such a property. This month, for the first time, Genius Brands will begin hosting quarterly earnings conference calls as a means to explain our performance and highlight key trends and activity within the business. We are excited with what we are seeing, and we believe our shareholders will be as well. I have always said that it takes three years from the time the first property is created until it is developed, produced, and on the screen, with consumer products on shelf. Now we are just beginning to see the fruits of that process.Adding to the excitement of RAINBOW RANGERS:LLAMA LLAMA will be delivered to Netflix in October, and product will begin to appear on shelf at retail this 4th quarter.SPACEPOP will go into its second season this 4th quarter with more product, more retail distribution and more content.THOMAS EDISON'S SECRET LAB will debut licensed product through a direct-to-retail license with a soon to be announced national retailer introducing 14 items across science, activity kits and compounds. Products will be in nearly 1,000 stores nationally in time for the all important Q4.KID GENIUS CARTOON CHANNEL: we expect to be in 80 million US TV Households this year, a hugely valuable benchmark, putting us in three out of four households in America.We are grateful for the confidence our investors have placed in Genius Brands and look forward to that being reflected in our revenue forecasts later this month.Andy HeywardChairman & CEOGenius Brands International, Inc.Image Available: http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2017/5/2/11G137717/Images/GBI_Logo-26bff49f12cd960195b1fb5418fa04fb.jpg Image Available: http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2017/5/2/11G137717/Images/Rainbow_Rangers_new-b185876e31f79c4ead3573987861349e.jpegReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoTrunk Club.

The complete letter follows:NEWS OF "SPACEPOP": EARLY SALES STRONG!Dear Genius Shareholders and Friends,As many of you know, less than two weeks ago we debuted our SpacePOP collection at nearly 300 Toys"R"Us locations nationally. This December 1st launch strategically positioned our brand right in the heat of the holiday season where we are successfully competing against some of the biggest kid's brands in the world, such as Monster High and My Little Pony/Equestria Girls.THE BIG NEWS TO SHARE IS THAT EARLY SALES ARE STRONG ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES.Toys"R"Us offered us some of the most premium real estate in its stores, placing our merchandise in the "What's Hot & New" section which is located in the front upon entering the store. We are also featured in the "the hottest & newest" section. Nothing could better categorize SpacePOP as the hot and brand new product!In these locations, fans and consumers will find the widest variety of SpacePOP products, including Fashion Dolls, Collectible Blind Bag Figures, Board Games, Books, Puzzles, CDs, DVDs, Electronics, Beauty Accessories, Cold Weather Accessories, Bags & Backpacks, Water Bottles, and much more from our many licensees. Many of these items are exclusive to Toys"R"Us and have made their commercial debut over the past few days. We are working closely with Toys"R"Us on the marketing of this collection to maximize sales at this all-important time of the year. Together with Toys"R"Us, we see this as a platform from which to launch SpacePOP into an extremely productive long-term partnership.I want to share with below you some images from the field that are supported with branded signage and show how the SpacePOP program is being merchandised as a collection. What we find very encouraging so early on is that consumers are opting in to the brand and buying product.We encourage you to get out to your local Toys"R"Us store to see the SpacePOP collection for sale first hand, as well as Kohl's where the SpacePOP apparel product line now is debuting. We hope that you will share the enthusiasm that we have, and as these videos below demonstrate, the genuine interest generated organically by our current fans and new fans finding us at Toys"R"Us for the first time. The videos below, are not paid sponsorships, but are a couple out of hundreds of fan videos that are popping up across YouTube and other social media outlets evidencing SpacePOP as an emerging brand for which we are already building a following. And by the way, the serialized SpacePOP videos on YouTube now have over 11.7 million views and are growing daily!Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYi92ZwS1U0Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbLjBWyWN3Y&t=6sThe launch at Toys"R"Us coincides with the SpacePOP debut this month at Claire's and earlier this fall at Kohl's. Together, this strategic tripod is the first step in what we anticipate will be a lucrative program for years to come. Just as you, our shareholders and investors are watching, so is every other major retailer with whom we are in deep discussions for what their SpacePOP programs will look like for 2017.Finally, while you are out there checking up on SpacePOP, if you have a bit of a sweet tooth, visit your local ‪Dippin' Dots where you can find our SpacePOP promotion running with them nationally too!Go SpacePOP!!!-Andy HeywardChairman & CEOGenius Brands International, Inc.Image Available: http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2016/12/14/11G125110/Images/SpacePop_Art_4x6-43ba9b0f12dda2a78af64bb2e9d55226.jpgReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump to cops: 'Please don't be too nice' while arresting 'thugs,' and don't worry about their heads when you toss them in the 'paddy wagon'Business InsiderEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredThe 'two pizza rule' is a secret to productive meetings that helped Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos become one of the world's richest menBusiness InsiderHere are the US targets North Korea most likely wants to nukeBusiness InsiderGM Cadillac chief: New CT5 will replace 3 sedans; EVs comingAutoblog3 Must-Own Stocks in 2017Banyan HillSponsoredChevron and Exxon Mobil have a tough path ahead: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoStocks mixed after heavy earnings weekTrump names John F.

He is the unifying element of the group, and the others love and admire him. DJ got his name because he likes to play tunes, and his track-scratching antics are wicked. Like all of his pals, DJ loves to dance!
 



FrankieThe soft, sweet, and hopelessly naive elephantFrankie is everything you'd want in an elephant friend (assuming you wanted an elephant friend). She's thoughtful, kind, warm-hearted, and sweet as cotton candy. Unfortunately, her brain is a bit like cotton candy too. With an adorably naive voice and attitude, Frankie is the heart and soul of the Genius gang. She loves to dance ballet and can stay in the air an amazingly long time!
 



VinkoThe super star super bearVinko is a dreamer, and his dreams are all about being famous. He just knows he's destined to be the most awesome bear in the universe. He carries virtually everything on himself at all times. His insane dance moves include: the butt wiggle, the belly bounce, and the face tap. But don't let him breakdance because he's a much better breaker than dancer.
 



TempoThe cool tiger with a hot beatIn a word, Tempo is cool. He's got the beat. Tempo is a tiger of few words and often speaks in two-word sentences: "He's cool!" -- "That's hot!" -- "So smokin'!" Tempo is very Zen, in a beatnik sort of way. He plays the sax and slides his paws around the dance floor with grace. Tempo can break the laws of gravity and tap dance up the walls too!
 



OboeThe brainy, British banana phobic monkeyOboe is a pedantic, didactic, erudite simian Einstein. Unfortunately, no one understands a word he says. In contrast to being a genius in all things scientific, Oboe is totally clueless in all things personal: relationships, emotions, manners… they don't register on his radar. The others try to help Oboe overcome his analytical barriers, but he comically fails at every attempt to get past his infinite neediness.
 



RosieThe shy bunny with a short but funny faceDon't let her cute looks fool you. Rosie is one scrappy little rabbit. Despite her tiny size, Rosie acts like she is a black belt in hop kiddo! She kicks her feet wildly as if they were deadly weapons. When it comes to music, Rosie is the real rock star of the group. She plays drums. Not just a toy drum but a full 10-piece drum set.
 



LolaThe feisty, in-your-face poochLola is a can-do girl who is not the slightest bit intimidated by bigger kids or the toughest challenges. And boy, she's filled with energy! She loves to make up new dances that are totally off-the-wall, herky-jerky spaz attacks. She loves to sing and make up song lyrics but has an off-key howling voice. But it doesn't matter because her confidence is contagious!
