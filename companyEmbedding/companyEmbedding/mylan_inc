Mylan Quality





















Mylan applies one global quality standard across our facilities, and across our product line…regardless of market. 

At Mylan, whether it’s a medication for millions or for a handful of people our priorities are to meet or exceed industry standards. 

Because there’s nothing generic about our standards. Our internal teams conduct reviews of all products, start to finish. No matter where in the world they are made. In fact, we championed a law that empowers the FDA to biennially inspect all manufacturing facilities around the world that supply the U.S. market.





        "We have one global quality standard, because we know where our priorities are. It all starts and ends with you."
    

Robert J. Coury
Chairman















To us, trust goes beyond our global quality standards. It’s all about caring for the people who will be helped by what we do. 

Most of all, quality is the reason we can say to 7 billion people that we know where our priorities are: It all starts and ends with you. Because Our Mylan Is Your Mylan.



















Therapeutic Innovation

Our worldwide research and development group includes approximately 3,000 scientists and regulatory experts who innovate every day.
Key categories



Why Generics
Low cost and high quality. Our generics contributed to U.S. health care system savings of an estimated $1.46 trillion from 2006 to 2015, and $227 billion in 2015 alone. And our global quality standard applies to all our medicines, no matter where they’re made.

Why Generics?





















At Mylan, we have one global quality standard in everything we do. 

Because there is nothing generic about our standards. Our internal teams conduct reviews of all products, start to finish. No matter where in the world they are made. 

Why such high standards? Because we truly care about the people who will be helped by the medicines we make.  And we believe in earning that trust, from physicians, pharmacists, other healthcare professionals and patients, every day. It’s why we say, “Our Mylan Is Your Mylan.”

Want to know more about generic medicines? See the facts, figures and bioequivalence requirements below.










Percentage of U.S. prescriptions filled with a generic medicine









Number of U.S. prescriptions, brand-name or generic, filled with a Mylan product











Food and Drug Administration: This agency must approve every generic medicine before it can be sold in the U.S.









To gain FDA approval, generic medicines must be proven to be “bioequivalent” to their brand name counterparts. That means generic and brand name medicines are the same in the following ways: 

Active ingredient 
Maximum amount of medicine in the blood at any given time
Total amount of medicine in the blood from the time it’s taken until the body eliminates it 
Strength and dosage 
Route of administration—tablet, injection, etc. 
Expected safety and efficacy 
FDA evaluation of manufacturing facilities

Just because products have the same active ingredient does not mean they are bioequivalent. Once generic bioequivalence is proven, the FDA considers a generic medicine interchangeable with the brand name medicine. 









Average amount consumers can save by filling a prescription with a generic rather than a brand name medicine. The price of generic medicines is usually lower, when compared to brand name medicines, since they are not invented from scratch, generally subject to clinical trials or supported by advertising campaigns 









$1.46 Trillion! According to IMS Health, generic medications saved the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $1.46 trillion from 2006 to 2015, and $227 billion in 2015 alone.

Therapeutic Innovation





















Would it surprise you to know that we bring innovation to the field of generic medicine? Or that our research and development group includes approximately 3,000 scientists and regulatory experts who innovate worldwide every day?

It’s true. And it’s why we’ve challenged ourselves to reach higher and go farther for more than 50 years.






The Science of Solutions









Today we design bioequivalent versions of brand-name medicines, many of which are difficult-to-manufacture and difficult-to-formulate.  
We strive to create enhanced versions of medicines to differentiate our products from the pack.  And we pursue innovations in oral solid dose medicines, transdermals, injectables, creams, ointments, antiretrovirals and nearly a dozen other critical areas. 
Why? Because we believe every disease can have a treatment. We believe every epidemic should come to an end. Medical conditions great and small should be manageable.









Oncology


            From treatments for solid tumors and cancers of the blood to supportive care, Mylan helps healthcare professionals provide their patients with a wide variety of treatments for every stage of cancer survivorship. Learn more about Mylan's commitment to oncology.









Anaphylaxis


            Anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, is a significant public health problem. When anaphylaxis occurs, every minute matters and immediate access to epinephrine and emergency medical care is crucial. We advocate for increased anaphylaxis awareness, preparedness and access to treatment, because even one anaphylactic episode without access to epinephrine is one too many.
        








Antiretrovirals


            These medicines treat HIV/AIDS. Often, treatment regimens require a patient to take three or more medicines and may include an ARV medicine that breaks down if not refrigerated. Many places hardest hit by the epidemic are in warm climates—Africa and India, for instance—where refrigeration can be scarce. For such regions, Mylan was able to make a heat-stable version of an ARV medicine that doesn’t require refrigeration.









Cardiovascular


Our commitment to cardiovascular medicine beats strongly. Using our transdermal technology we have formulated adhesive patches that deliver medicine through the skin.









Respiratory


            We’re developing asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
 treatments that use a dry-powder drug-delivery platform technology. Find out more about our other brand name respiratory products.









Dermatology


            While we manufacture products in many formats—from tablets and capsules 
to injectables and transdermals—we also produce creams and ointments for
 dermatology. Our commitment to these medicines gained strength during 
the 1990s, when we acquired Bertek Pharmaceuticals. Today, we have 
several products in clinical trials awaiting approval as well as many creams, ointments, sprays and dressings.
        











Always Moving Forward









Innovation is a part of who we are and the reason we see the opportunity in every challenge.
Research and development





Creating Positive Change









            We’re committed to setting new standards in healthcare for people living with HIV/AIDS.

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

Criticism[edit]
EpiPen pricing[edit]
See also: Epinephrine autoinjector § Cost
See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Outrage Over EpiPen Pricing


The huge increase of the list price for the severe-allergy drug injector has led to backlash against Mylan, the latest in a string of pharmaceutical companies accused of price gouging.

In its latest move to quell outrage over its price increases, the maker of the EpiPen has resorted to an unusual tactic — introducing a generic version of its own product.The company, Mylan, said on Monday that the generic EpiPen would be identical to the existing product, which is used to treat severe allergic reactions. But it will have a wholesale list price of $300 for a pack of two, half the price of the brand-name EpiPen.The raging debate over EpiPen pricing has offered a surprisingly wide window into the complicated world of prescription drug pricing, in which powerful drug companies, pharmacy benefit managers, insurers and federal health programs all play major roles. However, the system remains opaque.Last week, the company announced steps to increase the financial assistance for the branded EpiPen, for both commercially insured and uninsured patients. Those measures, however, did not stem the public furor, in part because the company kept the list price the same. So now, the company will essentially sell the same product under two names at two price points, in competition with each other.

The new move did not mollify critics, either. Some noted that even at $300, the generic would still be triple the price of the EpiPen in 2007, when Mylan acquired the product and began steadily raising its price. The increases have accelerated in recent years. Even the generic, expected to be available in several weeks, should provide a nice profit to Mylan because its manufacturing costs are believed to be far less than $300.

Several consumer advocacy groups, unhappy with Mylan’s handling of the drug’s pricing, said that on Tuesday they would deliver petitions signed by over 600,000 people to the company’s American corporate headquarters in Canonsburg, Pa. In addition, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform said that it had started an investigation and had asked the company for information about the product.Robert Weissman, president of the consumer group Public Citizen, said Mylan should just cut the price across the board.“The weirdness of a generic drug company offering a generic version of its own branded but off-patent product is a signal that something is wrong,” he said in a statement. “In short, today’s announcement is just one more convoluted mechanism to avoid plain talk, admit to price gouging and just cut the price of EpiPen.”While brand-name drug companies sometimes start selling so-called authorized generic versions of their own products, it is usually to undercut an outside generic competitor. In this case, Mylan faces no immediate generic threat.So why is it acting? And why did it not announce the move last week with the other measures?The company suggested in its news release that its action required an agreement from its manufacturing partner, Pfizer. It also has said that merely reducing the list price of the drug would not necessarily lower the prices for patients, because the out-of-pocket costs are set by pharmacy benefit managers and insurers. The generic should mean savings for insurers and federal health programs like Medicare and Medicaid, in addition to some patients.“Because of the complexity and opaqueness of today’s branded pharmaceutical supply chain and the increased shifting of costs to patients as a result of high-deductible health plans, we determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option,” Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, said in a statement.Mylan has repeatedly pointed to high-deductible health plans, which leave patients with more out-of-pocket costs, as the main reason patients are suddenly noticing higher prices for EpiPens.

Mylan Chief on the $600 EpiPen


Heather Bresch, chief executive of Mylan, discusses the controversy surrounding the recent 400-percent increase in her company’s life-saving allergy injector.

Adam J. Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, who studies the drug distribution industry, said that if Mylan had simply lowered the price it would have risked angering all parties in the distribution network, including pharmacy benefit managers, wholesalers and pharmacies, which take a piece of the total amount spent on the drug.

Introducing a generic “is a way to do it without making enemies with a bunch of Fortune 25 companies who control your fate,” he said.Still, by selling both a generic and a branded version of the drug, one Mylan product is now battling another for sales.

Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated in a note on Monday that Mylan’s overall revenue per epinephrine auto-injector prescription would be reduced by around 25 percent, to about $280, because of the introduction of the generic.A couple of factors are expected to limit that revenue decline. The term EpiPen is so familiar that many doctors write prescriptions for it by name, rather than for a generic epinephrine auto-injector. While pharmacists in many states will be able to substitute the generic version, some are almost sure to sell the branded version instead, leaving Mylan with higher revenue.In addition, Mr. Fein said, insurers might have negotiated deals with Mylan that make the brand-name version less expensive for them than the generic. “It’s going to depend on your particular insurance plan, and the kind of deal they have negotiated,” he said.Consumers might also have incentives to use the brand-name drug in some cases because most of them would have no co-payments if they use a savings card being offered by Mylan. They might face a co-payment, albeit a relatively small one, for the generic product.Despite the lower revenue from releasing the generic, Mr. Gal said the move could be good for Mylan shareholders by easing the downward pressure on the company’s stock. After falling more than 10 percent last week, Mylan shares were up slightly on Monday.It is not uncommon for brand-name companies to introduce a generic version of their own product — known as an authorized generic, in part to try to retain some sales once generic competition arrives. But the generic industry and some other critics say the practice undermines the economics of the generic business and ultimately can lead to higher costs for consumers and insurers.

A study by the Federal Trade Commission several years ago found that some generic manufacturers agreed to delay the introduction of their generic product by years if the brand-name company promised not to introduce an authorized generic.Mylan settled litigation with Teva in 2012 allowing Teva to introduce a generic EpiPen in 2015. It is not known if part of that agreement was for Mylan to withhold any authorized generic. If not, then Mylan might have been planning to introduce this authorized generic when Teva introduced its own product. But Teva disclosed earlier this year that its application had been rejected by the Food and Drug Administration.Still, it might be only a matter of time before Mylan faces new generic or nongeneric competition. Other companies, sensing opportunities, are looking at developing less expensive products that, like EpiPen, provide a rapid injection of epinephrine to counter anaphylaxis that can occur from a bee sting, peanut allergy or other cause.And pressure is mounting on the F.D.A. to be more accommodating in allowing alternatives on the market.Epinephrine, the drug, is already generic. The challenge has been developing an easy-to-use auto-injector that can reliably deliver the right amount of drug when used by the patient or caregiver under emergency circumstances. Sanofi removed a nongeneric competitor to EpiPen, called Auvi-Q, from the market last year because of dosing problems.

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

Mylan N.V. is an American global generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company registered in the Netherlands, with principal executive offices in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, UK and global headquarters in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, US.[2] In 2007, Mylan acquired a controlling interest in India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a top producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for generic drugs,[3] and the generics business of Germany-based Merck KGaA.[4] Through these acquisitions, Mylan grew from the third-largest generic and pharmaceuticals company in the United States to the second-largest generic and specialty pharmaceuticals company in the world.[5]
In 2016, Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen, an epinephrine autoinjector, became controversial and was widely referred to as "price gouging". As a result, investigations were opened into whether Mylan had misclassified the EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, a common form of pharmaceutical fraud. In October 2016, Mylan settled these investigations with the U.S. Department of Justice, agreeing to pay $465 million and enter into a corporate integrity agreement concerning the rebate program. In a report published on June 12, 2017 the Institutional Shareholder Services criticized Mylan for the "outsized compensation" of Mylan's directors. Former CEO Robert Coury received a "$98 million" 2016 "pay package" in spite of the "harm to the company inflicted by the EpiPen controversies" and "steep shareholder losses." The report urged Mylan's shareholders to "oust all of Mylan's existing directors".[6]

Location[edit]
Founded in 1961, the company was first located in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.[16] The company moved to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1965, and in 1976 it relocated its corporate headquarters to the Pittsburgh suburb Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. Finally in 2004 it moved to a new office center in nearby Southpointe, a suburban business park located in Cecil Township, where it is still located.[17]
Stock[edit]
On February 23, 1973, Mylan had its initial public offering (IPO),[18] becoming a publicly traded company on the OTC market under the ticker symbol MYLN. In 1976 the stock moved to NASDAQ. Their final stock move was in 1986, when their stock became available for trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol MYL. Currently, the stock is traded on the NASDAQ.
History[edit]
Mylan Pharmaceuticals was founded as a drug distributor in 1961 by Milan Puskar and Don Panoz.[16] In 1966 Mylan began manufacturing penicillin G tablets as well as vitamins and other dietary supplements.[16][19]
Panoz left Mylan in 1969 and Puskar quit the company in 1973, as it grew and experienced financial difficulties; the board hired Roy McKnight as board chairman, who convinced Puskar to return in 1976.[19]
Mylan discontinued operating as a contract manufacturing organization in 1980 and instead chose to market their products under their own "Mylan-labeled" brand.[citation needed]
With the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Act in 1984, Mylan and other small generic companies gained value; in the eighteen months following passage of the law Mylan's earnings grew 166% to $12.5 million and its stock value rose 800%.[20]
In the 1980s one of the most prescribed drugs in the US was Dyazide, a diuretic that was a combination drug containing triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide; it had been on the market since 1965 and its patents had expired in 1980.[21] Complications arose with the introductions of generics versions, because the formulation of Dyazide resulted in variable batches that made it impossible for generic manufacturers to show that their versions were bioequivalent.[22][23]
Some generic companies committed fraud trying to bring a generic version of Dyazide. Bolar Pharmaceutical had the first generic version approved in 1987,[21] but it turned out that Bolar had fraudulently substituted Dyazide for its own version to conduct studies that were submitted to the FDA by 1989 the FDA rescinded its approval based on its suspicions and filed criminal charges against Bolar, to which Bolar eventually pled guilty in 1991.[24][25][26]
Mylan chose to develop a new version of a triamterene/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug instead of going the generic route; it developed a different, more stable formulation[23] and used different dosages of each active ingredient (50 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 75 mg triamterene, compared with Dyazide's 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide and 50 mg triamterene).[27] This drug had to get approval as a new drug, as opposed to a generic; their product was called Maxzide and was approved in 1984.[27][28] The higher dose allowed once per day dosing, which Mylan and its marketing partner, Lederle, believed would help it compete against Dyazide, which had $210M in sales in 1983.[27] However, Mylan's patents on the drug were declared invalid in court, and its marketing exclusivity expired in 1987, prompting a rush of generic competition[29]
Mylan had concerns about the practices of its competitors and the FDA in general, and also with regard to companies seeking to bring generic versions of Maxzide. Mylan hired private investigators to examine its competitors' practices, and when it found evidence of corruption, it submitted it to the House Oversight and Investigations Committee, which investigated and found fraud and corruption within the Food and Drug Administration's generic drugs division and at other generic companies.[19] Two of the companies that had gotten approval to market generic versions of Maxzide, Vitarine Pharmaceutical and Par Pharmaceutical, were targets of Mylan's initial investigation and were found to have used Mylan's Maxzide to obtain their bioequivalence data, leading both companies to withdraw its generic competitor to Mylan's product.[19][30]
The corruption in the nascent generics industry and at the office in the FDA regulating it was widely covered in the media, and led to widespread concern among doctors and the public in the late 1980s and early 1990s that generic drugs were not really the same as the branded drugs they were meant to replace.[24][31][22]
In 1987 Mylan agreed to enter into a joint venture with Bolar to buy Somerset Pharmaceuticals; Mylan wanted access to Somersets' drug discovery capabilities as well as its new drug for Parkinson's, selegiline; the deal was completed in 1988 but its consummation was dependent on FDA approval of selegiline, which came in 1989.[19][32][33]
Mylan acquired Bertek Inc. in 1993 for its transdermal patch technologies, and kept as a subsidiary; in 1999 Mylan renamed the company Mylan Technologies Inc. (MTI).[34] MTI eventually came to be the contract manufacturer for the selegiline transdermal patch and was the first company to market generic nitroglycerin, estradiol, clonidine, and fentanyl transdermal patches.[34] Mylan acquired UDL Laboratories, a supplier of unit dose generic medications to institutional and long-term care facilities in 1996.[35]
In 1998 when it was the world's second largest generics company, Mylan came under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission after it raised the prices of its products, tripling them in the case of lorazepam; Mylan had entered into an exclusive agreement with Profarmica, an Italian company that supplied drug ingredients, after which Mylan's competitors had higher prices and a diminished supply of raw ingredients for lorazepam and other drugs.[36] Before the round of price increases the price of generic drugs had been 5 - 10% of the price of branded drugs and afterwards it was around 50%.[36] The FTC filed suit at the end of 1998 and 32 states filed parallel actions; the case was settled in 2000, with Mylan paying a total of $147M -- $100M in disgorged profits into a fund to reimburse consumers and state agencies that had overpaid, $8 million in attorney's fees to the State Attorneys General, $35 million, plus $4 million in attorney's fees, to settle certain class actions with insurers and managed care organizations -- and Mylan and three ingredient suppliers (Cambrex Corporation, Profarmaco S.R.L., and Gyma Laboratories) also agreed to an injunction barring them from entering into similar anticompetitive agreements in the future.[37][38]
In 2004 Mylan and King Pharmaceuticals began discussing a deal in which Mylan would acquire King for about $4B; Mylan wanted to expand its presence in branded pharmaceuticals and to acquire King's sales force.[39] The deal became one of the business soap operas of the year, and included an SEC investigation into King's accounting and Carl Icahn obtaining a 9.8% interest in Mylan and becoming its largest stakeholder in order to kill the deal; the parties called off the deal in February 2005.[39] Icahn offered to buy Mylan for $5.4B[40] and ran a slate of board members to change the direction of Mylan; he won three seats in May 2005.[41] In June Mylan bought back 25% of its shares in order to fend off Icahn;[42] and in July Icahn gave up his bid and sold his shares.[43]
In August 2006 Mylan announced that it had reached agreement to buy a controlling interest in Matrix Laboratories, an Indian supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients; the deal gave Mylan access to markets in India and China and was completed in January the next year.[44][45]
In May 2007 Mylan and Merck KGaA agreed that Mylan would acquire Merck's generics arm for $6.6B; the deal was completed that October and tripled the size of Mylan.[46][47] Mylan acquired the rights to market the EpiPen in the transaction; at that time annual sales were around $200 million[48] and the EpiPen had about 90% of the market.[49]
In 2009, the company filed two lawsuits against the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette after the newspaper ran an article that was critical of the quality control procedures used at the company's Morgantown plant.[50][51] The company had earlier quality control issues involving the FDA.[52] The lawsuits were dropped in 2012 without any damages paid by the Post-Gazette, which stated "The Post-Gazette did not find and did not intend to report that Mylan had manufactured or distributed any defective drugs. The Post-Gazette regrets if any reader of the article thought otherwise."[53]
Also in 2009, Mylan and its subsidiary UDL agreed to pay a $118M to settle a suit filed under the False Claims Act in which Mylan/UDL and two other companies were accused of underpaying states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. The program requires drug companies to give rebates to states under Medicaid and the rebates are higher for new drugs than for generics; the suit said that the companies sold new drugs but paid rebates as if they were generics.[54]
In 2011, Mylan entered into an agreement with Pfizer for the exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize Pfizer's generic equivalent to GlaxoSmithKline's Advair (US)/Seretide (UK) Diskus incorporating Pfizer's proprietary dry powder inhaler delivery platform;[55] Mylan launched the product in the UK in 2015[56] and in February 2016 the FDA accepted its ANDA, putting it in line behind Hikma and Sandoz to launch a generic version in the US.[57]
In 2012, Mylan launched a program called EpiPen4Schools to sell EpiPens in bulk and with discounts to schools; to participate in the program schools had to agree not to buy epinephrine autoinjectors from any other company for a year.[58]
In December 2012, the National Association of State Boards of Education launched a policy initiative designed to "help state boards of education as they develop student health policies regarding anaphylaxis and epinephrine auto-injector access and use," and advocated for state laws protecting school from legal liability for stocking and using epinephrine autoinjectors. Gayle Manchin, the mother of Mylan's CEO, Heather Bresch, had become president of the association in 2010, and shortly after had discussed donations from her "daughter's company" to the association. Manchin had been appointed to the West Virginia state school board by her husband, then-governor of the state Joe Manchin, in 2007.[59]
In 2013 Mylan acquired an Indian generic injectable drugs company, Agila Specialties Private, for $1.6 billion in cash.[60] In 2015 three plants acquired in that deal were issued warning letters by the FDA.[61]
After successful lobbying from Mylan,[48] in 2013, the "School Access to Emergency Epinephrine Act" became law after passing Congress with broad and bipartisan support; it protected anyone from liability if they administered epinephrine to a child in a school (previously, only trained professionals or the affected person were allowed to administer the drug, and were open to liability), and it provided some financial incentives for schools that didn’t already stock epinephrine autoinjector to start stocking them.[62] Joe Manchin, the father of Mylan's CEO, was a senator at that time.[59]
In July 2014, Mylan and Abbott Laboratories announced an agreement under which Mylan would buy Abbott's generic drugs business in developed markets for stock valued at about $5.3 billion.[63] Mylan acquired Mumbai-based Famy Care and expand its presence in the market for women's contraceptives at about $750 million.[64]
Starting in 2014, according to a 2017 report in the New York Times, mid-level executives began questioning the rate at which the company had increased and was planning to continue to increase the price of the Epi-Pen, and raising concerns that the price increases were unethical; the Times reported that when these concerns were brought to Robert Coury, the chairman of the board, Coury "replied that he was untroubled. He raised both his middle fingers and explained, using colorful language, that anyone criticizing Mylan, including its employees, ought to go copulate with themselves. Critics in Congress and on Wall Street, he said, should do the same. And regulators at the Food and Drug Administration? They, too, deserved a round of anatomically challenging self-fulfillment."  The Times reported that Bresch provided similarly dismissive responses.[65]
In April 2015, Mylan tried negotiate with the management of Irish pharmaceutical firm Perrigo to acquire the company, and when those negotiations failed Mylan attempted a hostile takeover, offering to buy $26B in shares directly from shareholders; too few shareholders agreed to sell their stock by the deadline set in November 2015 and the effort failed.[66]
Two weeks after Mylan made its first offer for Perrigo, Teva Pharmaceutical offered to buy Mylan for $40B; the combined companies would have been the world's largest generic company and the 9th biggest drug company in the world.[67] In July, Teva dropped its bid for Mylan and instead acquired Allergan's generic drug business for about the same price.[68][69]
In June 2015, Mylan agreed to work with Pulmatrix, a company with a proprietary inhaled drug delivery platform, to co-develop a product to treat for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; the product was PUR0200, a generic drug in a Pulmatrix device.[70]
In February 2016, the company announced it would acquire Meda for $9.9 billion.[71] In May of the same year the company announced it would acquire Renaissance Acquisition Holdings dermatology division for up to $1 billion.[72]
In 2015 Mylan had about $1.5B in sales of EpiPens and those sales accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[48] Mylan had maintained about a 90% market share since it had acquired the product, and had continually raised the price of EpiPens starting in 2009: in 2009, the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100; by July 2013, the price was about $265; in May 2015, it was around $461; and in May 2016, the price rose again to around $609,[73] around a 500% jump from the price in 2009.[74] In the summer of 2016, as parents prepared to send their children back to school and went to pharmacies to get new EpiPens, people began to express outrage at the cost of the EpiPen and Mylan was widely and harshly criticized.[75][76] The price hikes led to investigations by Congress and states attorneys general; in October 2016 Mylan agreed to pay a $465M fine related to incorrect rebates it paid under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77]
In December 2016, the attorneys general of 20 states filed a civil complaint accusing Mylan of a coordinated scheme to artificially maintain high prices for a generic antibiotic and diabetes drug. The complaint alleged price collusion schemes between six pharmaceutical firms including informal gatherings, telephone calls, and text messages.[78]
According to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General analysis, the U.S. government may have overpaid "as much as $1.27 billion between 2006 and 2016" to drugmaker Mylan N.V. for the EpiPen emergency allergy treatment. This represents three times the proposed settlement of $465 million announced by Mylan in October 2016. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee that launched the "probe of EpiPen pricing probe in 2016, released the analysis on May 30, 2017.[79] On the same day, a group of Mylan "investment funds urged shareholders to vote against the re-election of the company's directors after it paid Chairman Robert Coury over $97 million last year."[79]

EpiPen pricing[edit]

See also: Heather Bresch § Business executive
Mylan acquired the right to market and distribute the EpiPen line of epinephrine autoinjector devices from Merck KGaA as part of their 2007 deal;[73] that right had formerly been held by Dey LP, a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck.[80] The devices deliver about $1 worth of drug.[48] At that time annual sales were around $200M.[48] Bresch, the company's CEO, saw an opportunity to increase sales through marketing and advocacy, and the company launched a marketing campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of anaphylaxis for people with severe allergies that made the brand "EpiPen" as identified with its product as "Kleenex" is with facial tissue; the company also successfully lobbied the FDA to broaden the label to include risk of anaphylaxis and in parallel, successfully lobbied Congress to generate legislation making EpiPens available in schools and in public places like defibrillators are, and hired the same people that Medtronic had worked with on defibrillator legislation to do so.[48] Mylan's efforts to gain market dominance were aided when Sanofi's competing product was recalled in November 2015 and further when Teva's generic competitor was rejected by the FDA in March 2016.[81]
By the first half of 2015, Mylan had an 85% market share of such devices in the US[48] and in that year sales reached around $1.5B and accounted for 40% of Mylan's profit.[82] Those profits were also due in part to Mylan's continually raising the price of EpiPens starting in 2009; in 2007 the wholesale price of two EpiPens was about $100, the price was about the same in 2009, by July 2013 the price about $265, in May 2015 it was around $461, and in May 2016 the price rose again to around $609.[73] The last price increase sparked widespread outrage, including criticism from Martin Shkreli, "poster boy for grasping pharma greed," letters from two Senators and initiation of Congressional investigations,[82][83] and Mylan's pricing of the EpiPen was widely referred to as price gouging.[84][85][86] The last price increase coincided with a new line of TV commercials that were described as "shocking" and "no holds barred", depicting an anaphylactic reaction from the point of view of the young woman having it at a party, and ending with the young woman seeing her swollen and hive-covered face in the mirror before she collapses.[87] In response to criticism, Mylan increased financial assistance available for some patients to purchase EpiPens,[88] a gesture that was called a "classic public relations move" by Harvard Medical School professor Aaron Kesselheim.[89] The up to $300 saving cards can only be used by a small number of people who need the drug, and no one on Medicaid. They do nothing about the high price which is still being paid by insurers, who ultimately pass the cost onto consumers.[89]
In September 2016, the New York State Attorney General began an investigation into Mylan's EpiPen4Schools program in New York to determine if the program's contracts violated antitrust law[90] and the West Virginia State Attorney General opened an investigation into whether Mylan had given the state the correct discount under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and subpoenaed the company when it refused to provide the documentation the state requested.[91]
In October 2016 the CEO of Mylan testified to Congress that Pfizer/King charged Mylan about $34.50 for one device.[92] In September 2016, a Silicon Valley engineering consultancy performed a teardown analysis of the EpiPen and estimated the manufacturing and packaging costs at about $10 for a two-pack.[93]
In October 2016, Mylan announced a settlement with the US Department of Justice over rebates paid by Mylan to states under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.[77] Questions had been raised by Congress and others about why EpiPen had been classified as a generic rather a proprietary product in the program since 1997; generic drugs have lower rebates (13%) than proprietary drugs (23%), and price hikes for generic drugs cannot be passed onto states, and a common form of pharmaceutical fraud involves misclassifying proprietary drugs as generic under the program.[94] Under the agreement Mylan agreed to pay a $465 million payment and to a sign a corporate integrity agreement requiring it to perform better in the future;[77] the settlement also resolved cases brought by states related to the rebates.[95] Simultaneously with the settlement Mylan also announced it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the drug rebate program.[96]
In June 2017 the New York Times published an article reporting on internal Mylan discussions about price increases on the EpiPen between 2014 and 2016, in which the company chairman expressed disdain for people and agencies who might criticize the company; the reporter wrote: "Those top leaders’ responses are a far cry from the message on Mylan’s website, which says that 'we challenge every member of every team to challenge the status quo,' and that 'we put people and patients first, trusting that profits will follow.'", and also noted that "The firm is a case study in the limits of what consumer and employee activism, as well as government oversight, can achieve." [65][97][98][99]
Execution drugs[edit]
Mylan manufactures rocuronium bromide, which is approved by the state of Alabama for use in executions by lethal injection. European manufacturers refuse to sell drugs which can be used for executions to the United States, except to distributors or users who sign legally binding agreements that the drug will not be used for executions down the delivery chain.[100]
In September 2014, the London-based human rights organization Reprieve told Mylan that they were the only FDA-approved manufacturer of rocuronium bromide without legal controls in place to prevent its use in executions, and there was "a very real risk that Mylan may soon become the go-to provider of execution drugs for states across the country". The German asset manager DJE Kapital (de) divested itself of $70 million in Mylan shares for that reason. Mylan said that their distribution was "legally compliant".[100]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
