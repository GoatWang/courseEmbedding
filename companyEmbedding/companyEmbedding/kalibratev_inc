 While our business is the service of hydraulic components, our major focus is addressing the concerns of our customers. Our goal is to establish productive relationships and many of our current customers have been with us since the inception of our company. Whether it is a ruptured hose, failed hydraulic pump or a cylinder with a broken piston rod, we have the expertise, inventory and equipment to get you back up and running with a minimum of downtime.
CPI was incorporated in 2000 and was located in a tiny shop in Kansas City, employing one technician. Due to outstanding customer care and the production of a quality product, our staff has grown to over 20 employees including a dozen highly trained and experienced technicians. We are currently housed in a 28,000 square foot facility on three acres in Blue Springs, MO. Today, we provide an unparalleled scope of hydraulic services to our growing customer base across the entire country. It is not by accident that we have experienced this kind of growth. We have remained dedicated and persistent in terms of following through on our commitments, providing value to our customers, and offering top notch customer service.






Cylinder Repair / Custom Fabrication:
Each month we fabricate and rebuild hundreds of hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders ranging in size from 5 inches to 40 feet. We maintain a large inventory of seals and can special order most seals overnight.
Hydraulic Tool Repair:
We service multiple types of hydraulic tools including impact wrenches, rail saws, tampers, and hammers. Brands we frequently service include Racine, Fairmont and Stanley.
Hydraulic pumps, motors, PTOs, and hydrostatic transmissions:

Our pump test stand is capable of testing up 
                        to 6,000 PSI and 100 GPM.


We carry a large inventory of pump and motor parts along with new and rebuilt exchange units ready to be shipped.


We service vane, piston, gear and gerotor 
                        pumps and motors. 



                    Machine Shop and Metal Fabrication:
We have a dedicated, full time machine shop with CNC technology and the ability to custom fabricate from drawings or your sample. We carry a large inventory of chrome plated rod and honed tubing.
Hydraulic Hoses, Fittings, and Adaptors:

About Us

 
 
 
KalibrateV, Inc. is developing a unique personal vitamin system that calibrates vitamin dosages from blood tests. Blood is tested every 90 days to re-calibrate each vitamin dosage. With the exclusive right to embed KalibrateMe’s ultra-convenient, ultra-affordable, and ultra-accurate blood test, the cost behavior is affordable for all.
The founders of KalibrateV have been engaged in the development of a unique, patented blood-testing process for the past 10 years that makes blood testing ultra-convenient, ultra-accurate, and ultra-affordable. KalibrateMe, Inc. is the affiliate company that performs these blood tests.  KalibrateV was founded during February 2016 for the purpose of embedding this blood test into a game-changing, personal vitamin system that customizes vitamins to each individual body’s needs and that will be introduced to the U.S. market. The patented, finger-prick blood test accurately calibrates a custom blend of multivitamins tailored to the individual’s blood test results, making the product unique in a competitive marketplace.
KalibrateV is a development-stage company.  It expects to enter the market with its pilot product in the first quarter of 2017 and launch nationwide in the third or fourth quarter of 2017.
