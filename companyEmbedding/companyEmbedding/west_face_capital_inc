SunOpta Under Pressure To Sell Business
Jul 29 16
West Face Capital Inc, is reportedly adding to pressure from Tourbillon Capital Partners, LP for SunOpta Inc. (TSXSOY) to sell its business. According to Reuters, which cited an unnamed source, West Face has launched its own campaign to get SunOpta to offload at least some of its assets. West Face, SunOpta's third-largest shareholder with an 8% plus stake in the business, wants the company to consider board or management changes if sales fail to materialize.

Recommends Replacing Incumbent Board Which Has Presided Over a More than 50% Stock Price Decline Since 2011
Calls for New Strategy Focused on Core Colombia Properties and Announces SupportFor Highly Regarded Oil and Gas Veteran Gary Guidry to Lead Gran Tierra as CEO
TORONTO, April 21, 2015 /CNW/ - West Face Capital Inc. (West Face), whose managed funds beneficially own approximately 9.8% of Gran Tierra Energy Inc. (Gran Tierra) (NYSE MKT: GTE; TSX: GTE), today sent a letter to the Gran Tierra Board of Directors announcing its intention to nominate six highly qualified director candidates for election to the Board at the 2015 Annual Meeting of shareholders scheduled for June 24, 2015.
In the letter, West Face highlighted what it believes is Gran Tierra's failed high-risk, high-cost exploration strategy in Peru, Argentina, and Brazil and the destruction of more than half of the Company's market value since the beginning of 2011, all overseen by the current four-member Board of Directors.  
West Face also outlined its proposal for a new strategy focused on Gran Tierra's core Colombia properties to restore value for shareholders and voiced its support for Gary Guidry, a highly regarded oil and gas executive with an outstanding track record of value creation, as the right leader to assume the position of CEO of Gran Tierra.
"West Face is committed to fixing Gran Tierra and creating value on behalf of all shareholders," said Thomas Dea, Partner of West Face.  
"We are putting forward a highly-qualified slate of independent directors, including Gary Guidry, who, in our opinion, are far better equipped than the incumbent board members to implement a new strategic direction for Gran Tierra and to take the steps we believe are urgently required for the Company to get back on track and realize its full potential value".
The six West Face nominees are:

(West Face), via funds we manage or advise (West Face Funds), intends to nominate six highly qualified candidates for election to Gran Tierra Energy Inc.'s (Gran Tierra) Board of Directors at the annual meeting to be held on June 24, 2015.  The new directors will have a mandate to replace the current Interim CEO with Gary Guidry, a highly regarded oil and gas executive with an outstanding track record of value creation in his four prior leadership roles as CEO.
The West Face Funds own approximately 9.8% of Gran Tierra's outstanding common shares, making us one of your largest shareholders, if not the largest.  West Face has a mandate to take large core positions in companies in which we have conducted extensive research and where we believe we can assist in realizing long-term value for the benefit of all shareholders.    
We are taking these actions with Gran Tierra because we believe the current four-member board, with an average tenure of seven years, has failed in its three most fundamental responsibilities: adopting a strategy for value creation, overseeing the proper allocation of capital, and ensuring the Company is led by the best possible CEO.
Lack of Proper Oversight has Resulted in Significant Destruction of the Company's Value.
Since the beginning of 2011, the current board has approved $1.7 billion in spending between acquisitions and capital expenditures.  Of this amount, approximately $860 million was spent in Peru, Argentina and Brazil, where there have been no appreciable new discoveries, reserve additions or production growth.  Over the same period, the share price has declined from $8.18 to $3.38, a 59% loss in market value per share.  This dismal result was not due to declining oil prices – the share price had already fallen to $4.30 by July 2012. 
In our opinion, the Board has been gambling on high-risk exploration using shareholders' capital, repeatedly and in the face of negative results, while at the same time losing focus on its promising, core Colombian assets.  For all of the capital deployed, Gran Tierra's core Colombian assets still provide most of the Company's production.  The Executive Chairman has called these excursions outside of Colombia "elephant hunting".  We call it engaging in high-risk, high-cost ventures in far less attractive locations, while ignoring the benefits of developed infrastructure, political stability, and access to global energy markets in your existing core geographies.  
Ineffectual Governance and Lack of Accountability.
In our opinion, the Board did not have the proper expertise to oversee the prior CEO and has avoided accountability for this deficiency.  On the day of the former CEO's resignation in February, the Board hastily promoted the Chairman, Jeffrey Scott, to "Executive Chairman" and raised the COO to Interim President and CEO.  There was no announcement of a CEO search.  There has been no clear articulation of strategy then or now, other than to be – in the Executive Chairman's words – "opportunity reactive".  We find the situation unacceptable. Mr. Scott's operating experience is limited to running a small private oil and gas company in western Canada.  He also continues to hold the title of Executive Chairman for another company and sits on several boards.  The Interim CEO, who may one day expand his experience to be a suitable CEO candidate, does not, in our view, have that experience today.  
We believe that Mr. Guidry's experience, by comparison, is clearly superior, having built exceptional value as CEO at four separate international oil and gas companies he led.
No Coherent Strategy.
We are undertaking these actions at a potentially important turning point for Gran Tierra.  The Company has approximately $332 million in cash, no drawn debt, and $150 million of capacity in its reserve-based credit facility.  In short, it has $482 million of "buying power", as well as the ability to undertake a business combination for shares.  In addition, the Company has attractive assets in Colombia and an ability to grow through targeted spending on new lands, through joint ventures or business combinations.  With the right leadership, we believe that Gran Tierra could become a very valuable company.  Alternatively, in our opinion, unless the history of poor governance and sub-par management is fixed, the Company risks further squandering its under-appreciated strategic position.  
We are not impressed by the Executive Chairman's articulation of strategy.  Here are statements from the Q4 2014 investors' conference call when asked about the company's strategy and planned use for its capital (our emphasis added): 
"…And the timeline for the $300 million [cash on the balance sheet], I don't think we have one other than we intend to be opportunity reactive." 
- Jeffrey Scott, Executive Chairman
"Now, when I look at this, at the world in general, and the entire world is on sale. So, while we're Colombia-specific right now, and I think you're right to say that, the moment Peru is sort of on the backburner and Brazil isn't also around. But there are other opportunities around the world when the entire world is on sale." 
- Jeffrey Scott, Executive Chairman
"…But what I've challenged the management team is that we may take our geographic blinders off here and, if we see a really compelling opportunity elsewhere, maybe we have to look at it."  
- Jeffrey Scott, Executive Chairman
We take this to mean there is a real risk that management and this Board, unconstrained by proper oversight, will again fail to focus on Gran Tierra's core operating areas in Colombia and complete one or more ill-advised business combinations that again destroys value for Gran Tierra shareholders.
Bloated Overhead Costs.
Gran Tierra has excessive general and administrative (G&A) expense as compared to its most similar peer companies.  Gran Tierra's G&A was $5.82 per BOE of production in 20141.  By comparison, a subset of its peers had average G&A of $4.74 per BOE of production in 20142.
On the Q4 2014 conference call, Jeffrey Scott said Gran Tierra's high costs were the result of high oil prices.
"We're a fairly high G&A company and OpEx has been where it has been as a result of $100 oil." - Jeffrey Scott, Executive Chairman
Apart from finding this response to be a confusing approach to cost management, we believe high operating costs are symptomatic of poor management and a culture lacking in accountability, starting at the Board.
Misaligned Interests Between Shareholders and Directors.
Since 2008, secondary market purchases of Gran Tierra's common stock by current insiders have totalled 66,561 total shares.  In contrast, the Board saw fit to award the Executive Chairman 400,000 options and 100,000 restricted stock units (RSUs) upon being appointed to his current position, which also pays a base salary of $360,000 (Canadian dollars) cash per year.  In addition, the Board approved a so-called change-of-control payment equal to two times his base salary.  
The newly appointed Lead Director, Scott Price, has not purchased any Gran Tierra shares that we have been able to identify.  All of the common shares he owns appear to have been obtained by way of the Company's share exchange with Solana Resources in 2008.  In 2010, he sold over half of his shares for gross proceeds of more than $20 million prior to the acquisition of Petrolifera in early 2011.  The two other directors have very modest holdings.
By comparison, Gary Guidry and members of his team have acquired in the open market approximately 2.5 million Gran Tierra common shares worth approximately $8.6 million – even before having the ability to influence the Company's direction.  This meaningful commitment from a prospective CEO is indicative of his seriousness and confidence in his abilities to create value for Gran Tierra shareholders.
West Face Proposes a Refocused Strategy.
West Face believes Gran Tierra should re-evaluate money-losing initiatives in Peru and Brazil.  It should refocus financial and management resources on Colombia where it benefits from proven petroleum basins, well developed infrastructure, established markets, and scale.  The Company's cost structure should be brought into line and accountability should be introduced into the organization to drive consistent value creation.       
Refocus on Colombia.  Gran Tierra already has a well-established operating advantage in the Putumayo basin, with low-risk opportunities for expansion. In addition, we believe there are many opportunities for value creation in the middle and lower Magdalena basins as well as the Llanos basin. With a focus on proven basins within Colombia, we believe Gran Tierra is well positioned to create shareholder value through organic growth and smart acquisitions.  The preponderance of the Company's capital budget should be targeted to development, with a small allocation to exploration.  
Address Cost Structure.   Accountability starts at the Board and with the CEO and binds the organization together with a common purpose.  A competitive cost structure is the result of a well-run exploration, development and production company, not the end in itself.  Gran Tierra's operating and capital efficiency will be optimized by refocusing strategy on development, production, and exploration in Colombia.
Improve Capital Allocation.  Gran Tierra does not need to take "bet-the-farm" risks in frontier basins to build value.  Capital should be used primarily to appraise and develop attractive assets it already owns.  Over the last seven years, while Gran Tierra's attention was not focused on Colombia, a number of other companies have successfully undertaken lower-risk exploration in proven basins within Colombia.  We believe there is still considerable value to be built in Colombia, including in open lands and from joint venture partnerships and possible business combinations.  But if attractive projects are not identified in the future, capital should be returned to shareholders tax efficiently by way of share repurchases.  
West Face Proposes a Newly Reconstituted Board and New Management.
West Face Believes New Leadership is Required.  The Board of Directors should be renewed with highly qualified and experienced individuals.  The Board then should assume its mandate and engage Gary Guidry to lead the change as CEO.  We believe this will help unlock the Company's potential and value.
Gary Guidry is a Proven Value Creator.  The last four companies in which Mr. Guidry has been the CEO have averaged a 45% annualized return to shareholders over multiple market cycles and multiple operating jurisdictions3.  He is a professional engineer and has more than 35 years of experience developing and maximizing assets in the international oil and gas industry. He has direct experience managing large, international projects, including assets in Latin America, Africa, the Middle-East and Asia. 
Most recently Mr. Guidry was the President and CEO of Caracal Energy, a London Stock Exchange listed Company with operations in Chad, Africa.  He held that position from mid-2011 until the Company was acquired by Glencore plc for $1.8 billion in mid-2014.  Shareholders received a return of 101% during this period, compared with a FTSE 350 return of 8% over the same period.  
Prior to Caracal, Mr. Guidry was the President and CEO of Orion Oil and Gas (TSX listed), which operated in western Canada from mid-2009 until mid-2011 when it was sold.  During his tenure, shareholders earned a return of 127% as compared with the TSX E&P Index return of 20%.  From May 2005 until December 2008, he was the President and CEO of Tanganyika Oil Company (TSX listed) which operated in Syria and Egypt. Under his leadership, Tanganyika grew production from 6,000 bbl/d to over 20,000 bbl/d and was purchased by Sinopec International Ltd. for $2.0 billion with shareholders receiving a return of 385% as compared to the TSX E&P index return of negative 7% over the same period.  Prior to Tanganyika, Mr. Guidry was CEO of Calpine Natural Gas Trust.  Between the IPO of the company in October 2003 and November 2004, when it was sold to Viking Energy Trust, he grew 2P reserves by 39% with shareholders earning a return of 62%. 
In 2014, Mr. Guidry was awarded the Oil Council Executive of the Year award for his leadership role with Caracal Energy. 
As a measure of his commitment, Mr. Guidry and his team have already made a large capital commitment to Gran Tierra through the personal acquisition of approximately 2.5 million common shares now worth $8.6 million. 
West Face's Board Candidates are Well Qualified to Oversee Gran Tierra's Development.  
West Face intends to nominate six directors who each possess the capacity for rigorous and independent thinking.  They have varied professional backgrounds and will provide the required fresh perspective.  The current Board, in our view, is entrenched, unaccountable, inward-looking, and not aligned with shareholders.

Conclusion: Time for Action.
We do not have confidence in the Board of Directors and senior management of Gran Tierra.  As significant shareholders, we are troubled by the value destruction that has occurred under the current Board's watch, in the form of a more than 50% decline in the stock price since the beginning of 2011.  The status quo is unacceptable.  Gran Tierra needs a refocused strategy, a proven CEO, and a fresh perspective from the Board.  We request that you work constructively with us to make the required changes in the least disruptive way possible.  It's time to fix GTE.
Yours truly,

West Face Capital Inc., the hedge-fund firm that accelerated the overhaul of Maple Leaf Foods Inc., opened a credit fund to provide alternative debt financing to companies that don’t access traditional markets.
West Face, led by Chief Executive Officer Greg Boland, formed the Alternative Credit Fund in December 2013 and plans to raise $600-million for the offering, according to an e-mailed statement from the Toronto-based company. The fund currently has $400-million in commitments.
West Face’s new offering will benefit from companies that face special situations that fuel their need to raise money or issue debt. Global credit hedge funds returned an average 8.6% in 2013, according to data compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc, outperforming the 1.5% decline in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Canada Broad Market Index.
The fund “allows us to address opportunities of greater maturity and with less liquidity than is appropriate” for the firm’s core funds, Partner Tom Dea said in the statement. The fund will invest primarily in special situation credit and privately negotiated debt, he said.
West Face’s new fund, which will seek opportunities mainly in Canada, can invest in second-lien debt, mezzanine loans, acquisition financing, and bridge loans focused on special situations. Special situations are events that can have an impact on a company’s operations, including proxy battles, takeovers, executive changes and board shake-ups. The term can also apply to companies in financial distress.
Activist Approach
West Face, an investor known for its activist approach, manages more than $2-billion. The firm closed its first deal for the credit fund in December as lead investor in an US$80-million unsecured debt financing for Xcite Energy Ltd., a North Sea oil and gas explorer. The financing also included a common equity and warrant component.
West Face’s Boland in 2011 won a seat on the board of Maple Leaf, a Toronto-based producer of foods from hamburgers to frozen pasta, and has pushed for changes at the company. Maple Leaf is considering selling its bread unit, garnering interest from Grupo Bimbo SAB and others. West Face owned 11% of the company’s shares as of March 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Boland was also elected to the board of directors of Longreach Oil and Gas Ltd. by shareholders proposing a change. Most recently, funds advised by West Face provided US$250-million of equity funding to department-store chain Hudson’s Bay Co. in its acquisition of Saks Inc.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
