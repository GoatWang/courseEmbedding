SolarWinds, Inc.

                    Since our founding in 1999, SolarWinds’ (NYSE: SWI) mission has been to provide purpose-built products that are designed to make IT professionals’ jobs easier. We offer value-driven products and tools that solve a broad range of IT management challenges – whether those challenges are related to networks, servers, applications, storage or virtualization.

We distinguish ourselves by refusing to accept the status quo established by most other enterprise software vendors. Face it: The vast majority of IT management tools today are difficult to use, expensive, and really do not address the realities of today’s real-world IT management challenges. Sadly, IT pros have resigned themselves to accept this as just another part of the job. But we do not think enterprise software has to be as complicated as its made out to be.

At SolarWinds, we are fanatical about putting our users first in everything we do. We strive every day to deliver powerful functionality that is easy to use with one of the fastest and longest lasting ROIs in the market.

Our approach is to deliver "unexpected simplicity" and redefine the expectations IT Pros have for enterprise software.

Simply put, we work to:

    Eliminate the complexity found in traditional enterprise software – making it easier to find, buy, deploy and maintain.
    Connect with our community – using daily interactions with our large, global user community to guide our product development and strategy.
    Constantly evolve our products – ensuring that our software is on point to meet the most important problems that IT Pros have today, and continues to deliver increasing value over the lifetime of ownership.

Our company was built by network and systems engineers who know what it takes to manage today’s dynamic IT environments. They combined this expertise with a deep connection to the IT community to create IT management products that are effective, accessible and easy to use.

The result?

IT management software that works for you – and that delivers on our promise of "unexpected simplicity.
