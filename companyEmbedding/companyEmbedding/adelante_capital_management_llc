Amazon’s $13.7 Billion Step into Bricks & Mortar
Last Friday, e-commerce juggernaut Amazon announced an agreement to acquire Whole Foods Market in an all-cash transaction valued at $13.7 billion.

1Q17 Capital Market Outlook
There are a number of mitigating factors keeping a lid on the 10-Year Treasury Note yield: “monetary offset,” global yield differentials and the possibility that Trumpflation may disappoint in actuality.

In the U.S.: June CPI was unchanged m/m versus a 0.1% m/m decline in May. The data fit in with recent trend of softer inflation readings that Fed has largely chalked up to idiosyncratic factors. Fed Chair Yellen did note this week there is some uncertainty about how much inflation will respond to tightening resource utilization. REIT Focus: Rexford Industrial Realty acquired 3 industrial properties in Southern California in 3 separate transactions for a total of ~$71.5M. The acquisitions were partly funded by the disposition of a single-tenant industrial property in Santa Ana for ~$18.7M. In China: June exports jumped to 11.3% y/y versus May’s 8.7% y/y reading. Imports also rose to 17.2% y/y versus May’s 14.8% y/y reading. The

In the U.S.: June nonfarm payrolls increased 222K versus the consensus estimates of 178K. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.4% from May’s 4.3% reading as more people started looking for work. REIT Focus: Apartment Investment and Management Company (AIV) announced that it acquired the remaining 47% interest in the Palazzo joint venture owned by institutional investors advised by J.P. Morgan Asset Management for $451.5M. The acquisition was funded by taking title subject to existing allocable debt of $140.5M and by payment of $311 million in cash proceeds funded with bank borrowings pending the sales of several properties on the east coast.

In the U.S.: The senate health care bill’s CBO score was released which projected that 22M Americans would lose their insurance coverage within a decade. The CBO also concluded that the bill would cut the deficit by $321B over the same time period. The Republican majority struggled to get support from five conservative senators and ultimately pulled the vote scheduled for this week. The IMF cut the 2018 U.S. growth outlook to 2.1% from its previous outlook of 2.5%. The fund highlighted that the change was due to them dropping the assumption that the Trump administration’s tax cuts and fiscal spending plans would boost growth and that the U.S. labor market was already at a level consistent with full employment.

Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test

Posted on June 23, 2017

In the U.S.: As expected, all 34 of the largest US banks met the minimal capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST). The test featured a severe global recession with the US unemployment rate rising by approximately 5.25 percentage points to 10%, accompanied by heightened stress in corporate loan markets and commercial real estate. REIT Focus: Pebblebrook Hotel Trust (PEB) sold the Dumont NYC, an upscale hotel on Lexington Ave. in Manhattan, to the LeFrak Organization for $118M. LeFrak plans to convert the 252 room hotel into apartments. In China: MSCI will include domestic China A-shares in its global indices starting June 2018.

Amazon Acquires Whole Foods

Posted on June 16, 2017

In the U.S.: The U.S. Senate voted 97-2 for fresh sanctions in response to a trio of Russian actions, including interference in the 2016 election, engagement in Syria, and the invasion of Crimea. Of note, the sanctions would prohibit President Trump from lifting the sanctions without Congressional approval. Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) announced the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (WFM) for $13.7B. The blockbuster deal shocked the markets with the bulk of grocers down over 10% and subsequent strip center REITs falling over 5% for the session. Analysts noted that the investment by Amazon could change the fundamental grocery space and put pressure on food manufacturing margins going forward. Whole Foods Market operates 440 stores in 42 states, and the acquisition

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
