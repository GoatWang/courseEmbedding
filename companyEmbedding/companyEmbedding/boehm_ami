Quickly and easily identify children who need help with basic relational concepts.
The Boehm-3 Preschool is an easy-to-administer tool for measuring 26 basic concepts relevant to preschool and early childhood curriculum. This test helps you identify children who lack understanding of basic relational concepts so that you can provide intervention sooner, increasing their chance of success in school. Each concept is tested twice, to verify the child’s understanding.
Features & Benefits
This measure enables you to:

Assess each concept twice to determine the child’s understanding across contexts
Stimulus Manual and Record Forms include both English and Spanish test items
Examiner’s Manual contains normative scores for English- or Spanish-speaking children
Administer and score in less than 30 minutes

Psychometric Information
The Boehm-3 Preschool was standardized and normed on a nationally representative sample of 660 children in the United States. Internal consistency reliability coefficients range from .85 to .92; test reliability ranges from .85 to .92. Evidence of validity includes test content information and a comparison of scores to the earlier edition of Boehm Preschool. Separate norms are available in Spanish, based on the performance of 300 Spanish-speaking children living in the United States. Internal consistency reliability coefficients range from .80 to .91; test reliability ranges from .76 to .88.
Materials
The complete kit includes:

Curriculum-based test summary
Observation and intervention planning tool
Parent Report form
Administration directions and testing materials for children who are differently abled

For children with low vision
Dr. Boehm, in conjunction with the American Printing House for the Blind, released a tactile version of Boehm-3 Preschool in 2015. The tactile version can be purchased through the American Printing House for the Blind.

It can be finished in an as-machined state, brushed or polished to mimic chrome. AMI specializes in aluminum: they’ve got finishing it down to a science. Spruce up the exterior of your car or truck with fuel doors, replacement door handles, grill and tailgate emblems, short stubby antennas, exhaust tips, and the traditional license plate frames.
Similarly, AMI has replacement knobs for your radio and heater, seat adjusters, shifter and more, whether in polished or brushed aluminum with o-ring accents. Choose a set of billet-style pedals covers and a billet mirror or opt for AMI chrome trim, and your ride will be complete. Most of these accents are either self-adhesive or attach in seconds with a simple setscrew.

One innovative product from AMI that is genuinely useful is their Hang-A-Hitch. It’s the answer to a problem inherent to the receiver hitch: what do you do with the ball mount to your hitch when the trailer isn’t attached. If you keep it with the truck, it has to go in a toolbox, or inside the cab, or simply left to rattle around in the bed. If it’s left with the trailer, it either sits on the ground, or perches on the tongue. In either case, it’s probe to damage or theft. The Hang-A-Hitch provides a bracket to hold the ball mount safely out of the way, whether it’s inside the pickup bed or alongside the tongue, safe and dry. Drilling a second hole in the mount will allow you to lock it to the vehicle and prevent theft or unauthorized usage.

Demon camber. You may know it as oni-camber. You've seen the look, and whether you like it or not is totally beside the point. The great thing about this stanced look is that it gets your attention. From the interviews we've read with owners and drivers of these machines, that is exactly what they are after.

Neither are we, so upgrading your car or truck's power and handling is just a click away in our Performance Parts department. You can pack more air and fuel into your engine with free flowing filters and cold air intakes, big carburetors and throttle bodies, high flow injectors and intake manifolds; get a fat spark to fire that mixture with performance plugs, wires, and ignition systems; and give those spent gases a quick exit and get a rumble to boot with headers and low restriction exhaust systems. And if you crave massive increases in go-power, we have complete engines, turbochargers and superchargers, and nitrous oxide systems. But performance isn't just about power, you have to handle the turns and hit the binders once in a while and for that we have suspension and brake systems for every need and purpose. Check out our vast selection of lift kits, lowering kits, shocks, struts, springs and sway bars and state of the art drilled and slotted brake rotors, multi-piston calipers, and performance compound brake linings.We all like to modify and customize our vehicles, but sometimes you just need to fix them or do maintenance to make sure they last. We can help you save money by doing the job yourself, with auto parts and tools to repair any part of your machine and maintenance supplies to help keep it going for many more miles. Water pumps, alternators, starters, clutches, timing belts, mufflers, and more are all here along with the chemicals and tools you need to get repair jobs done right. Regular maintenance has been proven to extend the life of a vehicle and we can help keep yours in top shape with filters, lubricants, spark plugs, brake pads and more. And to make sure you never tire of looking at your pride and joy we have an extensive selection of wax and polish, car wash, tire dressing and detail supplies.

Many of the grille guards we offer also have light guards that extend from each upright and wrap around to protect vulnerable headlights from damage. Another protective feature offered on some grille guards is a perforated screen that will protect your grille from rocks and other debris that could pierce your radiator and leave you stranded. Most grille guards have several predrilled mounting points for individual off-road lights and LED light bars, and we also offer guards with strong and durable winch mounts, and even handy bumper level steps for easy engine access.Bull bars are designed to protect your bumper and the lower part of the grille from damage, and of course, to amp up your rig’s style. If you’re looking for protection without the massive look of a grille guard, a bull bar is the way to go. Most of the bull bars we offer are available with a stylish and functional skid plate that often includes the maker’s logo, for additional protection that also allows you to show off your good taste in accessories. Like the grille guards, bull bars usually have predrilled mounts for off-road lights, and some even come with the lights included. And if you’ve been thinking of adding a winch, check out our winch mount system that includes a bull bar.We know that the front of your truck or SUV isn’t the only area vulnerable to damage, although you’re probably more likely to sustain rear end damage on the street than from anything you’d encounter off-road. Inattentive and careless drivers can do a number on your rear bumper and tail lights if you let them, so be prepared. Strike a preemptive blow by installing one of our rear bumper guards and a set of tail light guards. You’ll show the rolling masses that you’re not going to stand for any abuse, complement your front end mods, and complete your rig’s transformation. We also offer sturdy front bumper guards to protect the vulnerable plastic front bumpers on many SUVs and crossovers.
With its 2 center uprights and adjoining center tubes and plates, a push bar resembles a grille guard or brush guard, but unlike the latter two, a push bar has to do more than just protect the front of the vehicle - a genuine push bar has to allow the vehicle on which it’s mounted to safely push another vehicle. Push bars are commonly installed on police and emergency vehicles for this purpose. We offer a complete line of push bars as well as push bar attachments like center light mount channels, wing wraps for additional front end and headlight protection, and PIT (Precision Immobilization Technique) bars that help enable police pursuit vehicles to execute PIT maneuvers and stop fleeing vehicles.

Many of the grille guards we offer also have light guards that extend from each upright and wrap around to protect vulnerable headlights from damage. Another protective feature offered on some grille guards is a perforated screen that will protect your grille from rocks and other debris that could pierce your radiator and leave you stranded. Most grille guards have several predrilled mounting points for individual off-road lights and LED light bars, and we also offer guards with strong and durable winch mounts, and even handy bumper level steps for easy engine access.Bull bars are designed to protect your bumper and the lower part of the grille from damage, and of course, to amp up your rig’s style. If you’re looking for protection without the massive look of a grille guard, a bull bar is the way to go. Most of the bull bars we offer are available with a stylish and functional skid plate that often includes the maker’s logo, for additional protection that also allows you to show off your good taste in accessories. Like the grille guards, bull bars usually have predrilled mounts for off-road lights, and some even come with the lights included. And if you’ve been thinking of adding a winch, check out our winch mount system that includes a bull bar.We know that the front of your truck or SUV isn’t the only area vulnerable to damage, although you’re probably more likely to sustain rear end damage on the street than from anything you’d encounter off-road. Inattentive and careless drivers can do a number on your rear bumper and tail lights if you let them, so be prepared. Strike a preemptive blow by installing one of our rear bumper guards and a set of tail light guards. You’ll show the rolling masses that you’re not going to stand for any abuse, complement your front end mods, and complete your rig’s transformation. We also offer sturdy front bumper guards to protect the vulnerable plastic front bumpers on many SUVs and crossovers.
With its 2 center uprights and adjoining center tubes and plates, a push bar resembles a grille guard or brush guard, but unlike the latter two, a push bar has to do more than just protect the front of the vehicle - a genuine push bar has to allow the vehicle on which it’s mounted to safely push another vehicle. Push bars are commonly installed on police and emergency vehicles for this purpose. We offer a complete line of push bars as well as push bar attachments like center light mount channels, wing wraps for additional front end and headlight protection, and PIT (Precision Immobilization Technique) bars that help enable police pursuit vehicles to execute PIT maneuvers and stop fleeing vehicles.

It is just sitting on a bit of an angle so i have to adjust it some. The installation was a little difficult with the instructions having poor pictures (the online pdf was no better). Took a bit of work to get it on the car and everything lined up but there was no drilling, just straight bolt-on to the inner bumper. You simply can't beat the looks for this price.WPosted by Wes (Grassie, AB) / June 28, 20172006 Dodge ChargerWas this review helpful for you?
