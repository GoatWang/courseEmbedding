The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.

Product Details

				Featuring a full set of rear horizontals and heavy-duty internal spreaders, this stepladder is ideal for professional contractors and industrial users. It features a lock-in system to secure tools from falling while keeping them right at hand. The fiberglass rails are nonconductive for working near electricity, and a bracing system helps protect them from damage. The double-riveted steps are knee braced and slip resistant. Back-up plates reinforce all top connectors.

              Weight                     How much does the ladder weigh?         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6306 weighs 22lbs.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-08-13                the 300 lb rating does this mean if my tech is 290 lb I should be ok with the 300 lb ladder if he gains 10 lb do i need to go with the 375 lb           Asked by: Anonymous             You also have to factor in the persons clothing and materials ne utilized. If that total weight is over 300 LBS then yes you need to procure a 375 LB rated ladder for the tech to utilize on the job.

Thank you for your inquiry.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-05-03                Suitability for use on electrical systems                     Hi, is this ladder rated for use on electrical systems. Specifically 277 volt lighting and 480 volt power systems.

Thanks.         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6308 is a fiberglass ladder that is recommended for use around electrical. We have no voltage recommendations/comparisons.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2017-05-03                Availability                     Is this ladder still available for purchase if so where can i locate it ?

Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2014-06-20                Color specification by capacity                     Why this Red Stepladder is for 375lb, when the color chart said the Yellow is for 375lb. and red is for 300lb. Any error in the description,.. please let me know is confuse for me, thanks!         Asked by: Anonymous             The 6306 is in fact rated at 375lbs. Not all ladders are color coded depending on their duty rating. The duty rating stickers located on the side rail of the ladder will reference the weight.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-03-05                What is the difference between the 6306 and the NTX1A06?           Asked by: Anonymous             The rails and the steps are the same between the NXT1A06 and the 6206 fiberglass step ladders. The difference between the ladders are the colors of the top and braces, and the attaching hardware for the respective pieces. Both ladders comply with the 300 pound rating.            Answered by: Werner Customer Care Date published: 2015-05-18                Dealer distributor does not locate anyone within 200 miles of my location , and the only 2 online distributors states it has been discontinued however           Asked by: Anonymous             The 6307 can be ordered online, or through a local distributor. Please visit the 6307 product page, and view the Buy Now feature on the site for an online distributor who carries this product. Using the Where to Buy feature will show a list of distributors who have recently purchased this product. Because the 7 foot ladder is not a common size, a local distributor may not have previously purchased one. Using the Find a Dealer Near You on the Werner Co. home page will show a list of all distributors in the area who could special order this product if they do not have it available.

I have 12 foot ceilings and trying to find the tallest ladder that will fit in the room, would prefer it to be 11'10&quot; or as close as I can get.

Different color top pad or anything?         Asked by: Anonymous             The only big difference between the 6312 and the 6212 besides the duty rating would be the color of the plastic top. The 6212 has a yellow lock in top while the 6312 has a black lock in top.

Different types of ladders are designed to keep you safe and productive when 
climbing or standing. Using the wrong style of ladder or simply ignoring the 
limitations of climbing equipment can result in a fall or serious injury.
                








                Height is referring to the actual ladder height. Extension ladders should be 7 to 10 feet longer than the highest support or contact point, which may be the wall or roof line. The highest standing level is four rungs down from the top. The highest permitted standing level on a stepladder is two steps down from the top.
                
Reach height is the maximum reach assuming a 5’6” person with a vertical 12” reach.
            




    
    Ladders are designed to safely hold up to a specific amount of weight. The Werner Performance System defines five different capacities using a color and star rating system. 
	The Duty Rating is defined as the maximum safe load capacity of the ladder. A person’s fully clothed weight plus the weight of any tools and 
	materials that are carried onto the ladder must be less than the load capacity. 
	



    
Werner offers ladder made from fiberglass and aluminum. Each material has characteristics which 
make it best for certain applications, or one material may simply fit the personal preferences 
of the user. For example, if working around electricity users should select fiberglass products 
due to their non-conductive side rails.

6304 FT 150 ZZProduct Description  High-temperature applications demand bearings that can withstand extreme heat without sacrificing performance, durability or reliability. IBSCO high temperature ball bearings provide benefits including reduced amount of time spent on upkeep of machines and more trustworthy production. Under high or extreme temperatures standard bearings experience difficulties such as increased operation noise, vibration and wear that can eventually lead to the failure of the bearings. High temperature ball bearings are manufactured specifically for applications that run in harsh environments where machines can't be greased as in low or room temperature applications.Structure&Series  6000 LT6003 FT 1506210 FT 1506309 F6006200 LT6203 FT 1506310 FT 1506311 F6006000 LT ZZ6303 FT 1506010 FT 150 ZZ6004 F6056200 LT ZZ6003 FT 150 ZZ6210 FT 150 ZZ6007 F6056001 LT6203 FT 150 ZZ6310 FT 150 ZZ6008 F6056201 LT6303 FT 150 ZZ6213 FT 1506204 F6056001 LT ZZ6004 FT 1506000 HV ZZ6205 F6056201 LT ZZ6204 FT 1506001 HV ZZ6206 F6056002 LT6304 FT 1506201 HV ZZ6207 F6056202 LT6004 FT 150 ZZ6002 HV ZZ6208 F6056002 LT ZZ6204 FT 150 ZZ6202 HV ZZ6209 F6056202 LT ZZ6304 FT 150 ZZ6003 HV ZZ6210 F6056003 LT6005 FT 1506203 HV ZZ6211 F6056203 LT6205 FT 1506004 HV ZZ6212 F6056003 LT ZZ6305 FT 1506204 HV ZZ6213 F6056203 LT ZZ6005 FT 150 ZZ6005 HV ZZ6214 F6056004 LT6205 FT 150 ZZ6205 HV ZZ6217 F6056204 LT6305 FT 150 ZZ6006 HV ZZ6220 F6056004 LT ZZ6006 FT 1506206 HV ZZ6305 F6056204 LT ZZ6206 FT 1506007 HV ZZ6307 F6056005 LT6306 FT 1506207 HV ZZ6309 F6056205 LT6006 FT 150 ZZ6008 HV ZZ6310 F6056005 LT ZZ6206 FT 150 ZZ6208 HV ZZ6311 F6056205 LT ZZ6306 FT 150 ZZ6209 HV ZZ6004 F6046006 LT6007 FT 1506210 HV ZZ6007 F6046206 LT6207 FT 1506004 F6006008 F6046006 LT ZZ6307 FT 1506007 F6006204 F6046206 LT ZZ6007 FT 150 ZZ6008 F6006205 F604608 FT 1506207 FT 150 ZZ6204 F6006206 F6046000 FT 1506307 FT 150 ZZ6205 F6006207 F6046000 FT 150 ZZ6008 FT 1506206 F6006208 F6046200 FT 150 ZZ6208 FT 1506207 F6006209 F6046300 FT 150 ZZ6308 FT 1506208 F6006210 F6046001 FT 1506008 FT 150 ZZ6209 F6006211 F6046201 FT 1506208 FT 150 ZZ6210 F6006212 F6046001 FT 150 ZZ6308 FT 150 ZZ6211 F6006213 F6046201 FT 150 ZZ6009 FT 1506212 F6006214 F6046301 FT 150 ZZ6209 FT 1506213 F6006217 F6046002 FT 1506309 FT 1506214 F6006220 F6046202 FT 1506009 FT 150 ZZ6217 F6006305 F6046002 FT 150 ZZ6209 FT 150 ZZ6220 F6006307 F6046202 FT 150 ZZ6309 FT 150 ZZ6305 F6006309 F6046302 FT 150 ZZ6010 FT 1506307 F6006311 F604 Product Show Our Factory Packing&Transport FAQ& Evaluate 1.Is it your company is factory or Trade Company? A:Yes, we are factory.  2.Does your factory have CE? A:Yes, we have ISO 9001:2008, and SASO.

4 Ft. Fiberglass Stepladder Type IAA

The Werner®4 Foot Type IAA Fiberglass Step Ladder is ideal for professionals who value safety and efficiency. It's duty rated for 375 pounds to support tools and equipment. The HolsterTop and its lock-in system keep tools in place while working for easy access. The steps of the Werner step ladder feature slip-resistant TRACTION-TRED® technology, and are double riveted, and knee braced for high stability. It comes with a complete set of rear horizontals and internal heavy-duty spreaders for versatility. Four rivets secure the top to each front rail of the heavy duty step ladder, and the top hinge has a shoulder bolt and nut. The EDGE® system minimizes damage to the rail, and the foot pads of the steps are connected to this system with rivets. This 4-foot step ladder is ANSI and OSHA approved.
