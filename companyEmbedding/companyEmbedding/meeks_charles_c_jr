About Meek's



History


With more than 90 years of experience in the building materials industry, Meek's has earned the reputation of being a provider of expert service as well as quality building and home improvement merchandise. Currently, there are 34 building centers in the Midwest Division with a general office located inSpringfield, Missouri. There are 13 centers in the West Coast Division with a general office located in Sacramento, California. Growth of this size is the result of continual response to the marketplace and the needs of the consumer.

In 1919, Charles Meek, Sr. opened the first Meek Lumber Yard in Lockwood, Missouri. Until the early 1950s he followed a sound growth pattern, expanding the company's territory throughout Southern Missouri. In 1951, Charles C. Meek, Jr. ventured to Northern California and opened the first Meek yard on the West Coast. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s the organization continued to prosper in both geographical areas. By the beginning of 1980, Meek's had 10 yards in the Midwest Division and 6 yards in the West Coast Division. It was during this time that Meek's had the foresight to see the changes that were taking place in the building industry and in the retail marketplace. An aggressive expansion program was started in the Midwest by upgrading and enlarging all stores and replacing five with entirely new facilities.

Meek's entered another new frontier in 1981 with their expansion into Northwest Arkansas. Growth continued during the 1980s and 1990s with the addition of several new locations in Missouri, Arkansas, and California.
Today, the company still remains family-owned under its fourth generation of leadership.  An aggressive growth plan has increased the company’s count to more than 40 retail locations. Meek’s is constantly adding new stores and a variety of services, products, and facilities to accommodate professional builders and do-it-yourself consumers alike.

The "Meek's Team" of aggressive, bold professionals, supported by active owner management, has positioned Meek's as one of the leaders in the industry, ranking in the top 30 nationally! Response to the demands of an ever-changing marketplace, new and innovative building centers and personal service to their customers has allowed Meek's to become the market leader in professional building products and services. Meanwhile, the basic philosophy of the company, "service to our customers, opportunity to our employees" has never changed since the first yard opened so many years ago.

About Meek's



About Meek's

Quality and convenience are two of Meek’s trademarks and it’s easy to understand why Meek’s is the ideal supplier for a variety of projects, from foundation to finish. Meek’s is more than just a lumberyard. It’s a home-improvement resource focused on continually expanding the ways it can better serve you.
PATTERN OF GROWTH
Meek’s originated in Lockwood, Missouri, where Charles C. Meek opened the company’s first lumberyard in 1919. In the early 1930s Charles C. Meek, Jr. relocated the business to its current headquarters in Springfield, Missouri. In the 1950s Charles C. Meek Jr. ventured to Northern California and opened the first Meek's yard on the West Coast. Today, the company still remains family-owned under its fourth generation of leadership. 
Over the years, Meek’s has evolved with the industry and converted many of its traditional lumberyards into home improvement centers carrying a wide variety of building products.  An aggressive growth plan has increased the company’s count to more than 40 retail locations. Today, Meek’s is constantly adding new locations and a variety of services, products, and facilities to accommodate professional builders and do-it-yourself consumers alike.
CUSTOMER SUPPORT
No project is too big or too small for Meek’s. As the largest construction supplier in the region, Meek’s is able to provide products and solutions for any building project, while the company’s hometown roots inspire a personal service experience. Meek’s also develops strong relationships with builders and contractors, offering a wide range of support services to help them efficiently meet their customers’ needs.
COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT
Meek’s interest in its communities’ well-being demonstrates how business can be personal, by donating its time, expertise, and resources to benefit area residents. For instance, Meek‘s has been a major sponsor to ABC’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, providing framing and structural panels, window and door units, and millwork items used to revitalize both an Ozarks family’s home and Camp Barnabas—a summer camp in Purdy, Missouri for special needs children. Likewise, Meek’s provides support and involvement to the local Home Builders Association and Habitat for Humanity.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
