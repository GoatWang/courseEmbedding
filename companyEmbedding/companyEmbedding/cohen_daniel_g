Daniel G. Cohen            











Chairman of the Board, Executive Vice President
As a member of the widely-recognized Cohen family, business building is in Daniel’s DNA. Both of his parents – Edward and Betsy – are business pioneers who, individually and together, have traded multiple companies in the energy, real estate and financial service industries. A student of Classical Studies, Daniel is well versed in Greek, Latin, and Mandarin, and was a Doctoral Candidate in Ancient Chinese Literature at the University of Pennsylvania. Daniel joined in his family’s entrepreneurial pursuits and, over the course of his career, has distinguished himself as a business leader in his own right. In a recent feature article detailing the success of the Cohen family, he made this important distinction regarding how his family approaches business: “We are not a family business. We’re a family that’s in business together.” Today, Daniel is adding to his family’s legacy by serving as President of Cohen and Company Financial Limited, as Chief Executive Officer of FinTech Acquisition Corp., as well as Chairman of the Board of both The Bancorp, Inc. and its U.S. subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank. Additionally, Daniel is an Executive Vice President at The Bancorp, and oversees the commercial mortgage-backed securities origination and sales division of the Company.
