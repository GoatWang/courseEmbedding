Hance (or
Hans) Hendrick appears to have arrived in Virginia in the early or mid 1680s.
As 'Hance Hendrick' he received a headright patent dated 25 April 1701 for 594
acres in Pamunkey Neck of King and Queen County, Virginia. The patent was for
transportation of himself, 'his wife Jane', and ten others. The land was
bounded by the Mattapony River, Fox Trap branch and Deep Bottom Branch and
adjoined the land of William Morris, 'the ridge road by the Schoole House', and
'Fox Trapp Bridge'. The land description shows he owned land in the area
earlier, as the grant refers to the 'old corner between Hance Hendrick and John
Oakes'. 
 
A second
patent, of 175 nearby acres for the transportation of four persons, was
recorded on 28 October 1702. Although no county is mentioned in the patent, the
land was on the Mattapony River and appears to adjoin the earlier patent, which
by this time was in newly-formed King William County. The land description
refers to 'a corner white Oake in sight of Hances old plantation', again
suggesting a missing earlier land entry. The 1704 quit rents of Virginia list
'Hans Hendrick' with 700 acres subject to quit rent in King William County. He
is the only Hendrick in Virginia. 
 
These two
patents clearly refer to the presence of Hance Hendrick earlier than 1701. An
explanation exists, but requires a brief digression. The Pamunkey Neck was
originally Indian land, in which white settlement was forbidden by a 1625
treaty with the Pamunkey King. That didnt stop settlers from occupying the
land, nor did it stop the Indians from retaliating. Bacons Rebellion of 1676,
was partly an attempt to defend these settlers from Indian attacks. Eventually,
the Pamunkey Indians leased land to a few whites, who then sold their rights in
smaller parcels to other settlers. Since the Colony received no income from
these lands, a committee formed in 1699 looked into the question of land grants
in Pamunkey Neck. It reported Ralph Yarborough, an Indian interpreter and
trader, to be among those who held a 99-year lease with the Pamunkeys. This
lease was evidently obtained in 1679. The committee also reported that 'Thomas
Hendrick' claimed 370 acres purchased from Yarborough and John Ascough. It is
uncertain when this land was sold to Hendrick, only that he claimed a right to
it in 1699. The Governor recognized this title. (This same committee
recommended, and the Governor implemented in 1699, the acquisition of land by
'treasury right' as an alternative to acquisition by headrights. For five
shillings per 50 acres, any English subject could acquire new land. All land,
however acquired, was subject to the annual quit rents.)
It seems
highly likely that 'Thomas Hendrick' and 'Hance Hendrick' were the same person.
Whether 'Thomas' was an error in transcription by des Cognets or whether his
name was, in the Dutch style, 'Thomas Hans Hendrick' is unclear. In either
event, analysis of other early patents to Yarboroughs assignees makes it clear
that the land of 'Thomas Hendrick' was the same land described in the 1701  and 1702 patents as Hance Hendricks 'old
plantation'. In addition, William Morriss land adjoined both Hance Hendrick
and Ralph Yarborough. William Hurt, who had patented land in New Kent as early
as 1654, was another assignee, and had had settled on land next to Hance Hendrick
by 1699. His son John Hurt, purchased land in the Neck in 1691, suggesting the
father had been there several years earlier. 
 
When Hance
Hendrick arrived in Virginia, and from where, is unclear. Headrights were
unrestricted with regard to the place of origin - that is, he could have come
into Virginia from any of the other colonies as well as from Europe. The fact
that he did not claim any children among his sixteen headrights suggests that
all his children were born subsequent to his arrival in Virginia, and we have
evidence that at least one child was born by about 1685. He is unlikely to have
arrived in Virginia before June 1680, since naturalization before that date
required an act of the Assembly and no Hendrick naturalization is noted in
Hennings Statutes. After June 1680, naturalization was handled by the
Governor, and would have been recorded elsewhere, usually in the Orders of
Council which are mostly incomplete. He was clearly a British citizen by 1699
when his claim was recognized by the Governor, as foreigners who had not taken
the oath were not permitted to own land. There are two possibilities. He may
have immigrated from Britain or Holland - the name suggests he was Dutch, but
plenty of people named Hendrick were also living in England in the early 1600s.
The second possibility is that he immigrated from one of the colonies north of
Virginia. Ralph Yarborough apparently promoted his land in both Britain and New
York, and perhaps elsewhere. Hence, Hance Hendrick could have been naturalized
in New York or Britain prior to his arrival in Virginia. Either would have been
an acceptable origin for headright purposes.
 
Hance also
owned land in adjacent New Kent County, south of Pamunkey Neck, as early as
1711, when it was processioned. By 1715 he had sold it, because it was referred
to as 'the lands of Hance Hendrick, now belonging to Mr. Anthony Winston' when
it was next processioned. The only colonial records that remain in New Kent are
in the vestry books of three of its six parishes. There are only two references
to a Hendrick in these records. Both 'Hance Hendrick Sr.' and 'Hance Hendrick
Jun.' filed patents on 24 March 1725 for land in King William County. The land,
200 and 100 acres respectively, appears to be close (but not adjoining) as both
patents were for land on or near Boot Swamp, a creek of the Mattapony which
lies almost entirely within what later became Caroline County. This is a
reasonable indication that Hans Hendrick Jr. was another son.
 
On 28
September 1728, Hans Hendrick, Adolphus Hendrick, and William Hendrick all
filed patents for land in neighboring Spottsylvania County. 'Hance Hendrick of
King William County' claimed 400 acres of new land. 'William Hendrick of King
William County' claimed 400 acres in the same vicinity, and Adolphus Hendrick
(see below) claimed 1,000 acres. None seem to have lived on their lands there.
The lack of a modifier may indicate that Hance Hendrick Sr. was dead by this
date. 'Jr.' and 'Sr.' applied to Hance were not seen again until 1740, despite
numerous intervening references to Hance Hendrick. The destruction of the early
records of King William, Hanover and Caroline counties prevent us from being
more accurate as to his date of death or from finding records of his will or
estate. 
 
The children
of Hance Hendrick, and presumably his wife Jane, seem to include at least the
following. Hans and these presumed children are the only Hendricks found
anywhere in Virginia records of the time, with the exception of a 'widow
Hendricks' in 1696. There are no further records of Jane Hendrick although a
series of 1738 court records concern a Jane Hendrick who had a bastard child,
surely not Hance Hendricks widow.

Misc. Notes
Following
from Ancestry.com, Kith & Kin: McKinzie, Blythe, Branch, & Bartlett:
From the
files of Robert W. Baird:
 
Jane
Hendricks identity is unknown. It is widely reported in published genealogies
and on the internet that she was Jannetze Van Meyer, daughter of Macyken
Hendrickson and Jon Josten Van Meter, and a first cousin of Hance Hendrick. The
original source of this claim is evidently a history of the Hendrick(s)
family[8]. However, there is not a shred of documentation to support this claim
and, in fact, there is no evidence that Jon Josten Van Meter (an immigrant to
New Jersey who never set foot in Virginia) even had a daughter of that name. If
he did, she would likely have been considerably older than Hance. Of the four
published accounts of this family that I have found, none offer any
documentation or explanation for their claims in this regard, and all four authors
were evidently unaware of most of the records cited in this paper.
 
Unfortunately,
Hance Hendrick lived in an area of Virginia for which few colonial records
exist. The colonial records of New Kent County were destroyed by the malicious
burning of the courthouse in 1787, for which the arsonist was hung. It was a
devastating loss for genealogists because the early records of 
several
successor counties were in that courthouse, including King William County. Most
remaining early records of King William County were subsequently destroyed in
another courthouse fire.

Dealership: Very good experience. 

Cadillac: Ability to 'fix a problem' with my vehicle is wholly dependent on GM's ability to support the electronic portions of their product.  iPhone and CarPlay support are clearly malfunctioning in my CT6 (and in all CT6s) and according to the dealership there are GM/Cadillac technical bulletins indicating such problems and more than 180 days with NO FIX.  GM wants to blame Apple, Apple believes it is a problem with the GM head unit -- so the customer pays the price. However, since the Cadillac falsely advertised CarPlay and it doesn't work properly with any version of the iPhone, it means not enough testing was done to support the advertising claim on the part of Cadillac, and now the dealership can't fix it and can only apologize and blame the vendor (Apple).  Ouch.

Since 2013, Cadillac has been having problems with their CUE (dead spots and spiderweb cracking of the screen). Mine was brought in for replacement. However, I was not reassured that the replacement was a newer and improved product - simply a never used before CUE and that 'there shouldn't be a problem' if the same issues reoccur. I also had to wait 3 weeks for the delivery of the new CUE vs the one week I was promised. Otherwise, the service reps were all friendly and tried to remain as positive as they could. The waiting room is always comfortable and super clean with a refrigerator filled with chilled water and multiple choices of coffee.  Wish they had hot chocolate for us non-coffee drinkers.
