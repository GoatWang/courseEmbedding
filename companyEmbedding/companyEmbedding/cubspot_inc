Frequently Asked Questions















What is a user?

A user is any person who uses the software. In our pricing plan, certain types of users -- like HubSpot partners, blog authors, and sales reps -- are exempt from user-based pricing tiers, which means you can have as many of those people working with you and using the software as you like. Other types of users, like administrators and marketers, are included and calculated in your chosen pricing tier.




Do I need to buy services?

Yes. All new HubSpot customers need to buy services to get started on the right foot with your inbound marketing efforts. Inbound marketing is about much more than just using a bunch of software to get marketing done; it’s about transforming your business to create marketing people love. That’s much easier to do in the thriving ecosystem of HubSpot customer training programs, and with the personal support of our famously passionate inbound marketing professors and consultants.




Are there any separate email sending fees?

No. HubSpot email costs are tied to the number of Contacts in your system. You can email the Contacts within your tier up to ten times per month. Since that works out to about one email every other business day, customers generally find this is more than enough. If you need to send even more than that, you can purchase more Contacts and increase your total monthly email send limit.




Do I need to pay for a year up front?

Yes. HubSpot contracts are billed annually by default. We’ve found that customers who can commit to a full year of using HubSpot will be more successful inbound marketers in the long run. And since your long-term success is our goal, we want to encourage those practices that support that goal. Bottom line: Annual contracts make happier HubSpot customers. And we want you to be happy. 




Are there any overage fees?

Not directly - but HubSpot's pricing is designed to scale with the size of your business, so we do ask our customers to purchase a product that will fit their level of use. This means purchasing enough Contacts to match your inbound marketing needs. So while we don't charge "overage fees" as such, you should expect your database to grow over time. And you'll need to purchase enough Contacts to match that growth as it occurs.




What type of support comes with  in Marketing Basic, Pro, and Enterprise?

For Marketing Basic, Pro, and Enterprise, phone and webform support is included in your subscription fee.  This  provides a means for you to have your questions answered by HubSpot customer support specialists. Of course, users of these products are also welcome to access the HubSpot Community at community.hubspot.com.

            Our Story
        



























































Inbound is Everywhere
An idea in the moment has sparked a global movement.And we’re just getting started.

















The Story Behind Our Story
In 2004, we met as graduate students at MIT.While Brian was helping venture-backed startups with their go-to-market strategy, we started to notice something curious: Customers had gotten really good at blocking out interruptive marketing and sales tactics. The tried and true tactics of old (direct mail, email blasts, cold calls) simply weren’t effective anymore.





Read More
Meanwhile, Dharmesh’s blog OnStartups was seeing massive growth in traffic. We’ll admit, we were surprised. How had this tiny blog with no budget generated more traffic than companies with professional marketing teams and way bigger budgets? It felt like a modern-day David versus Goliath.
So after many meetings, even more coffee, and the occasional Belgian beer (a shared favorite of ours) we came to the simple observation: 
People don’t want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople. They want to be helped.
It was time to make the marketing and sales process human. Time to treat buyers like people, not numbers on a spreadsheet. Time to build an inbound community and help people achieve their business goals in a more personable, empathetic way.
We called it, HubSpot.

Cubspot is a SaaS marketplace for parents and activity providers; it’s Amazon meets MindBody for camps, classes, and tutors. It's a one-stop-shop to discover, enroll in and manage camps, classes, and lessons for kids K-12 turning a wildly inefficient process that currently wastes 1 Billion hours—per year—for the 34M parents sending their 61M kids to enrichment programs tallying up to a $52B market.

Cubspot unifies the experience for both parents and providers becoming the personal assistant they both need. Providers list their programs in a UX-forward web app opening up a new channel for acquisition and conversion. They can subscribe to booking and payment vertical software. Parents join 

Cubspot, set their families up, and have full access to the marketplace, booking, reviews, calendar integration, readiness reminders, discount enrollment reminders, and activity management. When they’re ready to book programs, Cubspot will do it for them capturing a 6% service fee.

Parents are dedicated to finding the best informal learning opportunities for their child’s competitive advantage making our platform a hot EdTech entry. The product is live cubspot.com and we’ve captured the Boulder launch market and are expanding into Denver and all of Colorado now. Parent users are growing 68% MoM and Providers are growing at 100% MoM. We are seed-stage funded at $530k and currently in a $750k seed+ raise.

The Tech: Cubspot web app is comprised of various existing technologies including proprietary logic and numerous open source projects. Our product represents a unique combination of these technologies. Our road map includes providing relevant and timely activity suggestions to users and automated aggregation of provider data, among others. We will develop our own machine learning algorithms for these and other features.
