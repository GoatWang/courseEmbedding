Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)	 announced that the FDA’s Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted in favor of Mylotarg for the treatment of patients with newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The committee believes that the ALFA-0701 study investigating Mylotarg provides significant evidence supporting the risk benefit profile of Mylotarg in AML. A biologics license application (BLA) was submitted based on data from this study. A FDA decision is expected by Sep 2017.The ALFA-0701 evaluated the safety and efficacy of Mylotarg, an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), in addition to chemotherapy in AML. Mylotarg was administered to patients on the first, fourth and seventh day of the treatment.Shares of Pfizer have risen 2.1% since the beginning of this year, underperforming the Zacks classified Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which increased 10.4% in the same period.We remind investors that Mylotarg was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in 2000 as a single agent for treating CD33-positive AML in patients who had experienced their first relapse and were 60 years or older. However, 10 years later, Pfizer voluntarily removed Mylotarg from the market as data from a post approval phase III study, SWOG S0106, showed no clinical benefit and rate of fatalities due to treatment-related toxicity was significantly higher.The currently submitted BLA seeks approval for Mylotarg in two indications, for treating newly-diagnosed CD33-positive AML in combination with standard chemotherapy, and as monotherapy in patients aged over 60 who had first relapse and are not eligible for other cytotoxic chemotherapy. The BLA also includes data from five phase III studies including ALFA-0701, which contains 10 years of research data from 4,300 patients.Per the press release, AML occurs in nearly 80% of acute leukemia patients and about 21,380 people are estimated to be affected by AML in the U.S. in 2017. Several companies are developing therapies for treating AML. The therapies include Seattle Genetics, Inc.’s (SGEN  -  Free Report)	 SGN-CD33A and Intrexon Corporation’s (XON  -  Free Report)	 CD33-specific CAR+ T therapy, in collaboration with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc. (ZIOP  -  Free Report)	. However, despite recent developments there has been little progress in increasing the long-term survival rate in AML patients.Pfizer, Inc. Price and Consensus Pfizer, Inc.

Overview
Gene & Cell Therapeutics
Presentations & Publications






Focused on the discovery and development of new cancer therapies.
Thanks to a revolutionary technology platform, our pipeline of novel immuno-oncology therapeutics is growing.



ZIOPHARM Oncology and its partner Intrexon Corporation, a leader in synthetic biology, together with collaborators at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, are employing novel cell engineering techniques and multigenic gene programs to develop next-generation patient- and donor-derived adoptive cellular therapies based on designer cytokines, such as genetically modified T cells and NK cells, to target hematologic malignancies and solid tumors as well as graft-versus-host-disease. These technologies are designed to improve safety and decrease the cost, time and complexity of development associated with cell-based therapies.
CAR T-cell therapy is an immunotherapy which works by redirecting immune cells to a cancer target using a synthetic receptor to recognize a particular antigen or protein on the tumor cell. Our goal is to translate the early clinical promise of CAR T-cell therapy in hematologic malignancies to a broader range of targets, including solid tumors, with greater safety and efficacy, using technologies that augment the therapeutic potential of effector cells, are tailored to the patient and their disease , and are capable of meeting the oncology treatment on a global scale.

*ActoBiotics®, AttSite®, LEAP®, RheoSwitch Therapeutic System®, RheoSwitch®, RTS®, and UltraVector® are trademarks of Intrexon Corporation. 




RheoSwitch Therapeutic System®
The RheoSwitch® technology is a gene switch activated by a small molecule ligand which can be used to regulate the timing, location, and concentration of gene expression. Precise control over in vivo gene expression with RheoSwitch®  technology contributes multiple benefits, including a desirable safety profile for gene and cell-based therapies. As a component of the novel DNA-based therapeutic candidate Ad-RTS-IL-12, RheoSwitch®  is the only known biologic switch to have been tested in humans, and clinical results to date have demonstrated both potent systemic biologic activity and reversibility of the toxicity associated with immune activation. Ad-RTS-IL-12 employs RheoSwitch®  for the controlled expression of IL-12, an important protein for stimulating an anti-cancer T cell immune response. It is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for melanoma and breast cancer.

Oral Small Molecule Ligand (Veledimex) Precisely Controls the Expression of IL-12







Non-Viral Integration Platform: Sleeping Beauty Transposon/Transposase System
Sleeping Beauty transposon/transposase system
•    Efficient and nimble gene transfer method
•    Bypasses the cost, time, and complexity of viral-based delivery vectors







UltraVector®
The UltraVector® platform is an operating system comprising advanced DNA construction technologies, cellular and protein engineering, computational models and statistical methods which facilitate the rapid design, testing and production of complex biological systems. In addition to hosting all of the design, build and testing capabilities within one cohesive platform, UltraVector® learns by amassing a wealth of data over iterative experiments in this process. The UltraVector® platform is also capable of incorporating supplementary technologies, which can be selectively utilized depending on the desired biofunction.






Adoptive Cell Therapies in Cancer
In partnership with Intrexon Corporation and collaborators at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, ZIOPHARM is advancing a portfolio of adoptive cell therapies using multiple effector cells.  These include:

Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR+) T cells, which target cell surface tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) independent of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA), what we refer to as “public” antigens
T Cell Receptor (TCR+) cells, which target intracellular TAAs dependent on HLA, what we refer to as “Private” antigens
Natural Killer (NK) cells, which target tumors with loss of HLA, or tumors with no “antigens”

The therapeutic potential of effector cells depends on recognition of tumor cells and recycling effector function in the tumor microenvironment.  By making expression of either immunoreceptors or cytokines dependent on the RheoSwitch Therapeutic System® platform, we control expression of either, giving us the ability to modulate immune mediated toxicities or augment the therapeutic potential of effector cells.
Management of Potential Toxicity through Inducible Immunoreceptor Expression
Many attractive target antigens are expressed on normal cells

Inducible Cytokines

Ultimately, these technologies allow us to build and control personalized therapies for the disease and patient.
Personalized Immune Cell Therapy







Adoptive Cell Therapies in Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GvHD)
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is typically used for the treatment of various diseases including hematological malignancies, immunological deficiencies as well as non-malignant conditions. Approximately 40 to 60% of HSCT recipients develop GvHD, either acute or chronic, when immune (graft) cells in a transplant patient recognize their engrafted host as foreign and attack the patient's (host) cells.

Immunosuppressive agents and systemic steroids routinely used to treat GvHD have limited efficacy and toxicity, defining the need for safer, more effective therapies. Human studies have shown that administration of low-dose subcutaneous IL-2 in patients with steroid-refractory GvHD can act via regulatory T cells (Tregs) to ameliorate its clinical manifestations.
Through a collaboration with Intrexon, ZIOPHARM intends to expand on the benefits of cytokine immunotherapy under Intrexon's technologies to generate clinical-grade Tregs that can precisely deliver IL-2. In addition, the ActoBiotics® platform will be harnessed for its ability to target delivery of cytokine to the digestive tract using genetic engineering of bacteria (L. lactis), a site which plays a significant role in the body's immune system. These new ways of treating and preventing GvHD have the potential to broaden the number of patients eligible to receive allogeneic HSCT and also increase the number of effective donor/recipient combinations.








Laser-enabled Analysis and Processing (LEAP®)
LEAP® (Laser Enabled Analysis and Processing) cell processing instrumentation can conduct rapid on-plate identification and purification of cells of interest from large libraries of cells created by the Intrexon UltraVector® and bioinformatics technologies.  The platform provides a mechanism for testing the degree of protein expression in genetically modified cells by combining the flexibility of computerized image-based selection with the precision of laser purification to identify and purify high value cells.






AttSite® Recombinases
AttSite® recombinases facilitate rapid integration of DNA into predictable or targeted genomic locations to achieve stable gene activity over time. This tool eliminates many of the difficulties associated with traditional gene insertion, which is often difficult to perform and can result in unpredictable outcomes.






ActoBiotics®
ActoBiotics® biotherapeutics are a new class of orally delivered biopharmaceuticals.  Through Intrexon’s proprietary platform, food-grade microbes (L. lactis) are engineered to generate biologically contained ActoBiotics® therapeutics for in situ expression and secretion of novel proteins and peptides including cytokines, enzymes, hormones, and monoclonal antibodies within the body.  The ActoBiotics® platform offers the unique ability to deliver biological effectors selectively to the oral and gastrointestinal tract enabling treatment opportunities not achievable through customary mechanisms like injectable medicines and permitting ease of administration for patients. 






Gene & Cell Therapeutics
It sounds complicated, and it is, but we love to talk about it, because our technology is at the cutting edge of science and medicine



Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) T-cell therapy is an immunotherapy which works by redirecting immune cells to a cancer target using a synthetic receptor to recognize a particular antigen or protein on the tumor cell.  The promise of cell-based immunotherapies such as CAR T in cancer is extraordinary.  Early clinical results using CAR T have yielded long-lasting remissions in highly refractory hematologic malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
Among the challenges we face in advancing this potential is expanding it to include both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, controlling the potentially lethal toxicities associated with immune-mediated response to cancer, and employing technologies that allow us to use these therapies on a broad scale to address the millions of individuals affected by cancer worldwide each year.
ZIOPHARM Oncology and its partner Intrexon Corporation together with collaborators at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, are employing some of the most advanced technologies in the fields of synthetic, cell and molecular biology to achieve these goals. 
When the use of existing cell-based immunotherapy candidates reaches a commercial scale, the challenges of manufacturing increase exponentially, making many of these solutions unscalable in their current form.


Taking steps to advance both point of care and "off the shelf" solutions, ZIOPHARM and its partners will look to ensure that, as we advance the therapeutic potential of cell-based solutions, we are able to meet their potential demand in the global healthcare environment.

Our efforts to advance both point of care and off the shelf solutions focuses on the integration of several technologies.



Point of care product
Off the shelf product




Integration with RheoSwitch® control of T cell propagation and specificity in patients
Genetically modify and edit T cells to express CAR and eliminate TCR


Facilitates a no-culture solution to manufacturing
AttSite® landing pads for precision genetic engineering



iPSC processing technologies combined with LEAP® Instruments to engineer an HLA-matched product




As these technologies advance, the possibility of addressing cancer on a global scale using cell-based technologies becomes reality.

Ziopharm Oncology's stock tumbles after stock offering prices at deep discount
Shares of Ziopharm Oncology Inc.  tumbled 12% in morning trade Friday, after the biotechnology company's stock offering priced at a deep discount. The company said its follow-on offering of 9.7 million shares priced at $5.15, which is 28% below Thursday's closing price of $7.12. The stock hasn't closed as low as $5.15 since Oct. 14, 2016. The company has 132.4 million shares outstanding, according to FactSet. Ziopharm said that including the proceeds from the offering, expected to be $50 million, the company should have enough cash to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2018. The stock has soared 33% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 9.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.9%.

Ziopharm Oncology's stock tumbles after stock offering prices at deep discount
Shares of Ziopharm Oncology Inc.  tumbled 12% in morning trade Friday, after the biotechnology company's stock offering priced at a deep discount. The company said its follow-on offering of 9.7 million shares priced at $5.15, which is 28% below Thursday's closing price of $7.12. The stock hasn't closed as low as $5.15 since Oct. 14, 2016. The company has 132.4 million shares outstanding, according to FactSet. Ziopharm said that including the proceeds from the offering, expected to be $50 million, the company should have enough cash to fund operations into the fourth quarter of 2018. The stock has soared 33% year to date through Thursday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 9.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 6.9%.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
