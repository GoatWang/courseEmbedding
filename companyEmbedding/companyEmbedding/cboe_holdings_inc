Higher Trading Volume Fuels CBOE Holdings, Inc. Earnings
The exchange operator enjoyed record trading in its SPX options and VIX futures products in 2016.











                Joe Tenebruso
            

                (TMFGuardian)



            
            Feb 8, 2017 at 12:21PM
            
            





CBOE Holdings (NASDAQ:CBOE) reported fourth-quarter financial results on Feb. 6. The operator of the largest U.S. options exchange benefited from heightened trading in its proprietary index products and announced that its acquisition of a rival exchange was nearing completion.

Data source: CBOE Holdings Q4 2016 earnings press release.
What happened with CBOE Holdings this quarter? 
Operating revenue rose 5% to $163.2 million, mostly due to a 4% increase in transaction fees to $115.4 million.
Total trading volume jumped 13% year over year to 305.8 million contracts, or 4.85 million per trading day. Average revenue per contract (RPC), however, declined 8%, to $0.377, mainly due to higher volume discounts and incentives.
Total operating expenses increased 10% to $88.1 million, driven by higher professional fees and services related to CBOE's pending acquisition of Bats Global Markets (NYSEMKT:BATS). Core operating expenses -- which exclude volume-based expenses, depreciation and amortization, accelerated stock-based compensation expense, and unusual or one-time expenses -- were $53.2 million, up 7% compared with the prior-year quarter.
All told, operating income -- adjusted to exclude acquisition-related expenses and other special items -- rose 8% $79.8 million. Adjusted net income to common stockholders improved 5% to $51.5 million. Adjusted earnings per share, aided by share buybacks, also increased 7% to $0.63.





What management had to say
"The fourth quarter capped off another year of solid financial results for CBOE Holdings, highlighted by record trading in our SPX options and VIX futures," said CEO Edward Tilly in a press release.
Tilly also provided an update on its acquisition of exchange operator Bats:

In addition, we are closer to completing our pending acquisition of Bats Global Markets, Inc. (Bats), which we now expect to close by the end of the first quarter, pending the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions. We are preparing for a seamless integration process that will enable us to immediately begin to realize the benefits of bringing together Bats' U.S. and European equities, options, ETF trading and global FX platform with CBOE's wide array of equity and index options, multi-asset volatility products and educational resources.

Looking forward
CBOE issued a financial outlook for fiscal 2017, including:

Core operating expenses in the range of $214 million to $218 million, up 3% to 5% compared with 2016
Capital expenditures of $46 million to $48 million, up 4% to 8% year over year

"We finished 2016 on a strong note and enter 2017 excited about expanding our sources of value creation and the diversification of our earnings profile we expect to achieve through our acquisition of Bats," added CFO Alan Dean. "Our strong financial position and operating cash flow generation has allowed us to invest in CBOE's future, and we look forward to executing on our strategy to deliver long-term value creation for our stockholders."

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
Not all risks described below will apply to all products.  Please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular ETN.
An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. Please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the ETNs in “Risk Factors” in the applicable pricing supplement.
The ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.  They are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives.  The ETNs are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day.  Any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period.  Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results, as applicable.  Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, even intra-day.  If an investor holds the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive, in the case of the leveraged long ETNs, or negative, in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs.
Because the ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure, adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the ETNs and a greater likelihood of causing such ETNs to be worth zero than if such ETNs were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying Index.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity, acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although the issuer intends to list or has listed the ETNs on NYSE Arca or NASDAQ, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop.  The issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.  The issuer of the ETNs may delist the ETNs from any exchange for any reason at any time.
The issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the ETNs and may suspend further issuances at any time.  If the issuer suspends further issuances of the ETNs, it is possible that the ETNs could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value.  Any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time, including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the ETNs for an amount based on the indicative value.  Paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the ETNs are accelerated at the issuer’s option.
The trading price of the ETNs may vary considerably before any valuation date (as defined in each prospectus), due, among other factors, to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index, and other events that are difficult to predict. At higher levels of volatility, and since the ETNs are not principal protected, there is a significant chance of a complete loss of ETN value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat.
The daily resetting of each ETN’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each ETN to experience a “decay” effect, which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index.  The “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the ETNs to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index.  Accordingly, the ETNs are not suitable for intermediate- or long-term investment, as any intermediate- or long-term investment is very likely to sustain significant losses, even if the underlying index appreciates (in the case of the leveraged long ETNs) or depreciates (in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs) over the relevant time period.  Although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the ETNs are held, the decay effect can have a significant impact on ETN performance even over a period as short as two days.
If the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently (or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse ETNs), to offset the effect of the Daily Investor Fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the ETNs, the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale, early redemption, acceleration or maturity of the ETNs.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on an Early Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the Closing Indicative Value of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.
