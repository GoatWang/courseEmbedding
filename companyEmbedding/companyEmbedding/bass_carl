Early life and education[edit]
Bass was born in New York, New York to a chemist father and school teacher mother.[4] After starting at Cornell University, Bass took a break to build boats, furniture and sculpture in Seattle and Maine for five years. He returned to Cornell and graduated with Bachelor of Arts in mathematics in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1981, Bass co-founded a computer graphics company called Flying Moose Systems and Graphics Ltd., which became Ithaca Software in 1986.[4] The company commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system originally developed at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. Bass served as Ithaca Software’s chief technology officer and CEO.[4] He joined Autodesk when the company acquired Ithaca Software in 1993, serving as the chief architect for AutoCAD.[2] In 1995, Bass was forced out by Autodesk’s then president and CEO Carol Bartz, only to be rehired five months later, after top Autodesk engineers said they needed Bass’s software development skills.[5]
Bass left Autodesk in 1999 to launch Buzzsaw,[6] an online service for management of construction projects, where he served as president and CEO.[2] Bass returned to Autodesk when it acquired the company in 2001.[6] In addition to being the company's president and CEO from 2006 through 2017, Bass held a number of high-level positions at Autodesk, including executive vice president and chief strategy officer (2001 to 2002); senior executive vice president of the Design Solutions Group (2002 to 2004); chief operating officer (2004 to 2006); and interim chief financial officer (2008 to 2009).[7]
Tenure at Autodesk[edit]
In 2006, Carol Bartz stepped down as Autodesk’s president and CEO, naming Bass as her replacement.[8]
During his tenure as CEO, Bass focused on expanding the company beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product development[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D design.[2] He emphasized vertical markets focusing on model-based design, simulation and lifecycle management.[2] Under his direction, Autodesk introduced consumer-oriented products such as SketchBook, a mobile painting and drawing app with more than 7 million users as of Nov. 2011.[9] Bass helped lead the company to develop Building Information Modeling (BIM) and generative design technologies. In March 2008, Autodesk was ranked number 25 on Fast Company's list of "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies."[10]
Bass serves on the Board of Directors of Autodesk, HP Inc., Zendesk Inc., Planet, and Formlabs Inc.[1] He also serves on the board of trustees of the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Art Center College of Design, and California College of the Arts, and is a member of the advisory boards of Cornell Computing and Information Science, UC Berkeley School of Information, and UC Berkeley College of Engineering.[1] He previously served on the board of McAfee and iRise.[4] He currently acts as an advisor to Zoox Inc. and a special advisor to Alphabet CEO Larry Page. [11]
Bass announced that he would be stepping down as Autodesk's CEO effective on February 8, 2017. He remains a board member and special advisor to the company.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Bass owns a workshop near his home in Berkeley, Calif.,[5] where he designs and fabricates objects made from wood, metal and stone. Bass’ projects have included furniture, sculpture and a walk-in wooden rocket ship he built for his children,[13] which is on permanent display at Chabot Science Center.[4]
He is married to Daryl Austern, and they have two children.

Early life and education[edit]
Bass was born in New York, New York to a chemist father and school teacher mother.[4] After starting at Cornell University, Bass took a break to build boats, furniture and sculpture in Seattle and Maine for five years. He returned to Cornell and graduated with Bachelor of Arts in mathematics in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1981, Bass co-founded a computer graphics company called Flying Moose Systems and Graphics Ltd., which became Ithaca Software in 1986.[4] The company commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system originally developed at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. Bass served as Ithaca Software’s chief technology officer and CEO.[4] He joined Autodesk when the company acquired Ithaca Software in 1993, serving as the chief architect for AutoCAD.[2] In 1995, Bass was forced out by Autodesk’s then president and CEO Carol Bartz, only to be rehired five months later, after top Autodesk engineers said they needed Bass’s software development skills.[5]
Bass left Autodesk in 1999 to launch Buzzsaw,[6] an online service for management of construction projects, where he served as president and CEO.[2] Bass returned to Autodesk when it acquired the company in 2001.[6] In addition to being the company's president and CEO from 2006 through 2017, Bass held a number of high-level positions at Autodesk, including executive vice president and chief strategy officer (2001 to 2002); senior executive vice president of the Design Solutions Group (2002 to 2004); chief operating officer (2004 to 2006); and interim chief financial officer (2008 to 2009).[7]
Tenure at Autodesk[edit]
In 2006, Carol Bartz stepped down as Autodesk’s president and CEO, naming Bass as her replacement.[8]
During his tenure as CEO, Bass focused on expanding the company beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product development[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D design.[2] He emphasized vertical markets focusing on model-based design, simulation and lifecycle management.[2] Under his direction, Autodesk introduced consumer-oriented products such as SketchBook, a mobile painting and drawing app with more than 7 million users as of Nov. 2011.[9] Bass helped lead the company to develop Building Information Modeling (BIM) and generative design technologies. In March 2008, Autodesk was ranked number 25 on Fast Company's list of "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies."[10]
Bass serves on the Board of Directors of Autodesk, HP Inc., Zendesk Inc., Planet, and Formlabs Inc.[1] He also serves on the board of trustees of the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Art Center College of Design, and California College of the Arts, and is a member of the advisory boards of Cornell Computing and Information Science, UC Berkeley School of Information, and UC Berkeley College of Engineering.[1] He previously served on the board of McAfee and iRise.[4] He currently acts as an advisor to Zoox Inc. and a special advisor to Alphabet CEO Larry Page. [11]
Bass announced that he would be stepping down as Autodesk's CEO effective on February 8, 2017. He remains a board member and special advisor to the company.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Bass owns a workshop near his home in Berkeley, Calif.,[5] where he designs and fabricates objects made from wood, metal and stone. Bass’ projects have included furniture, sculpture and a walk-in wooden rocket ship he built for his children,[13] which is on permanent display at Chabot Science Center.[4]
He is married to Daryl Austern, and they have two children.

6 String bass

Condition
Mint


Description
Ahhh these wonderful basses are our personal pieces of Carl Thompson’s history, talent & inventive design. It was ordered personally by The Guitar Broker (Craig Brody) & made to our specs. This 6 String Bass was designed with the original style taken from Les Claypool’s personal famous Bass from the band “Primus” but with a beautiful twist. Known simply as the “Rainbow” Bass thru Carl’s client’s & network, we put this idea together of making a 2 pickup version w/frets (regionally) similar to Les’ bass. Carl took his time to make this one of his best basses ever. It also weighs in at 9 lbs…Carl’s secret recipe for quality & lightweight design. We wanted a fully electric bass having nothing metal except for the tuners & frets. Hence Carl made this bass with a beautiful all wood bridge assembly w/wooden saddles to keep that natural vibey tone Carl was so famous for. & I discussed this at least 3 times over the course of a year & he stated to me that it was his fanciest & most beautiful Bass he’s ever made. He documented it from its birth as you can see from the photos.  While in production, every one of Carl’s clients wanted to buy it. “It was being made for a special client in Florida” Carl said over & over to many people & not for sale.
 
Once she was delivered, we were stoked. But I noticed quickly something was missing. Where are the frets ? I called Carl right away & he said I never mentioned wanting frets & to send it back for the frets to be added. Staring at this wonderful piece of Carl’s luv I decided to hold off sending it back for a few weeks to see if I could fall in luv w/a 6 String Fretless bass that I was completely unfamiliar with playing. I picked up this 9 lb. delightful bass & said “she’s gonna sing I bet”. After I plugged her in & heard that “TONE” from god…I was hooked. Having the pretty matching colored fret lines inlaid in the ebony board made in easy to play & I decided to keep her as she is & enjoy her for life.
 
This magical 6 string bass will never leave my collection. They are true pieces of Electric Artwork that cannot be duplicated. Enjoy staring at them because that is all you will ever be able to do…ahhh.

Autodesk CEO Carl Bass is used to putting machines to work at his personal metal working shop in Berkeley, Calif.
                                                    James Martin/CNET
                                                 	BERKELEY, Calif. -- Carl Bass opens a drawer lined with black-handled chisels, picks one up and carefully runs the steel blade along his arm as if it were a straightedge razor. 	"See all those little hairs there?" he says, pointing to a dusting of black hair that settles into the drawer. "That's how you can tell if they're sharp." 	Bass is in his element. He hurries around his spacious, cement-floored woodworking shop, showing off both rudimentary hand tools and a collection of complex machines. Bass set up this workspace and a personal metalworking shop down the street as hobby spaces. But they both also serve as testing grounds for the company he runs: Autodesk. 	While design professionals are familiar with Autodesk, it's likely the multibillion-dollar company most people have never heard of. Autodesk makes more than 100 software products that millions of engineers, architects and animators use to design and model everything from bridges, buildings and roads to cars, planes and video games. Many of the creations you see around you -- whether it's One World Trade Center on the New York skyline, Grand Theft Auto on your game console or even a soldier's prosthetic leg -- were designed or modeled with Autodesk software.

  	Now the 33-year-old company is pushing into the consumer realm, bringing affordable software to the masses with the goal of helping people create. And that puts Autodesk smack in the middle of the Maker Movement that, at its core, encourages tinkerers and hobbyists to think of new ways to solve everyday problems. Makers combine do-it-yourself invention with technology -- which could also describe Autodesk's approach to design, simulation and modeling.
         "Some people buy yachts, some people buy fast cars. Carl does his workshop."
         Amar Hanspal, Autodesk's senior vice president for the Information Modeling and Platform Group
 	That positioning is just fine with Bass, who took over as CEO of the San Rafael, Calif.-based company in 2006. 	"One part is creativity, the other part is solving problems," says Bass. "You can step back and say we are trying to use technology to solve problems." 	Rather than looking like a buttoned-up executive, Bass more resembles a carpenter. He's tall -- 6 feet, 4 inches -- and prefers T-shirts and Carhartts to suits. He has a thick New York accent and often belts out a deep laugh. Bass is not your typical CEO, say people who work for him. Yes, he's business-minded, competitive and has strong opinions, but he's also unassuming and on a first-name basis with hundreds of his employees. 	Bass, 57, has been a maker since his 20s. Sawing, sanding and soldering seem to be part of his DNA. Before joining Autodesk in 1993 as chief architect for AutoCAD, he built houses on an Indian reservation and constructed boats in Maine. A quick scan of Bass' wood and metal shops shows dozens of objects he's made, like a chair built from one piece of plywood, a 2,000-pound iron table, baseball bats for his two sons and road-ready go-kart.

	"Some people buy yachts, some people buy fast cars. Carl does his workshop," says Amar Hanspal, Autodesk's senior vice president for the Information Modeling and Platform Group. "It's been in his blood. It's not a recent discovery."Autodesk and the Maker Movement	Set against the wall of Bass' woodworking shop is a 20-foot piece of bubinga, a distinctive type of wood with curly rose-colored grain and dark bark. "That's destined to be a table," Bass says, explaining that it's one of the newer additions to his decades-old collection. For instance, he carved his bed frame out of a piece of maple burl he had for 25 years. "Metal you go to the store and buy. Wood you accumulate over the years," he says. 	While Bass has always made things with his hands, he hasn't always seen Autodesk as playing a role in the Maker Movement, which began to gather steam in 2006 with the first Maker Faire in California. Shortly after Bass became Autodesk CEO, Dale Dougherty, founder of Make magazine, sat down with him to explain the movement. 	"I have to say, at the time, he wasn't buying it. I think he defined it as localized production," Dougherty recalls. "For many years, the company Autodesk wouldn't have resonated with the Maker movement as the consumer movement, their focus has been on professional design tools."On TechRepublic: Mickey McManus: Autodesk researcher. Futurist. Technology humanizer 	That changed in 2010. While Autodesk always had amateur users, it really began to focus on the consumer market that year. The company has since grown its consumer user base to 227.6 million people worldwide, far outdistancing the 12 million professional users who work with its software. 	One reason for that consumer growth is that Autodesk now gives away much of its software for free. Students, teachers and schools pay nothing for the company's professional products, while many small businesses get hefty discounts. Professionals, on the other hand, typically pay thousands for the software.Carl Bass has amassed a huge collection of wood at his personal woodworking shop in Berkeley, Calif.
                                                    James Martin/CNET
                                                 	"Part of what we're seeing with Autodesk is the democratization of that tool set. It's moving from just professionals to amateurs," Dougherty says. "The more they can make this easier for more people, the more powerful it becomes." 	Making design software more accessible has been the company's strategy since its start in 1982, when it offered a cheaper and (relatively) easier way to create 2D designs on personal computers versus requiring dedicated and costly workstations. Autodesk also was among the first to realize the benefit -- to itself and to its customers -- of allowing hundreds of other software companies to create products that hook into its programs. This universe of add-on products gave Autodesk an edge over its competitors, like PTC and Dassault. 	Now, by giving away free software to schools, Autodesk is creating a new pool of users who may one day buy its software. 	"It has a synergy with what we're trying to do," says Crawford Beveridge, who's been a director on Autodesk's board for 21 years. "Some would say a lot of our main focus is on very large customers who design cars or airplanes or buildings. But the Maker movement has a very important role to play in both the democratization issue and the opportunity to go to other businesses."It's everywhere	By far, the company's biggest markets are construction, architecture and engineering, and its most popular software is AutoCAD, which lets designers and engineers draft 2D and 3D drawings. But Autodesk also extends into other markets and offers software for things like 3D modeling, personal creativity, simulations, photo editing and animation. 	"When you step into  your car, use some type of other physical product, or walk into the  building you might be in now," says Marc Halpern, a research vice  president  in Gartner's Manufacturing Advisory Services division, "there's a  tremendous chance that Autodesk technology played a role in the design  or creation of that building or product." 	So, for example, the US Navy's first 45,000-ton amphibious assault ship USS America was created with Autodesk's ShipConstructor. Lightning Motorcycles used Autodesk's Dreamcatcher to design the world's fastest electric motorbike, which can  reach speeds of up to 218 miles per hour. And Autodesk's 123D Catch software was used to help figure out how to clip 25,000 LED lights on the San Francisco Bay Bridge for the  world's largest light sculpture called The Bay Lights.Filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron relied on Autodesk's MotionBuilder and Maya 3D animation software for his 2013 Oscar-winning film "Gravity."
                                                    Warner Bros. Pictures
                                                 	"Their software is the equivalent of a Ferrari," says Leo Villareal, The Bay Lights artist, who also used his own software for the installation. 	 Autodesk's animation, editing, motion capture and 3D rendering software has also been used in dozens of Academy Award-winning movies, including "Interstellar," "Avatar" and "Frozen." Filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron relied on Autodesk's MotionBuilder and Maya 3D animation software for his 2013 Oscar-winning film "Gravity." 	When Cuaron first set out to film "Gravity," he couldn't figure out how to realistically show actors Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floating in space. The movie's production team solved the problem by using Autodesk software to pre-visualize and animate the entire film before shooting. 	"If you take the shot where they're repairing the shuttle and the shuttle gets hit by the debris, everything there -- the shuttle, the debris, everything -- is created on the computer using our software and then is animated," says Maurice Patel, Autodesk's entertainment industry manager. "The main point about the movie and the use of technology is this trend we're seeing in the industry, which we call the blurring between the digital and real world." 	While Autodesk has been helping film companies stay on top of digital trends, it's also been working to keep current with the trends reshaping its own technology industry. One of the most transformative is cloud computing, where people can share applications, documents and data over the Internet. While cloud-based apps have touted their collaboration and teamwork benefits since the late 1990s, cloud services didn't become mainstream until 2009, when Google first publicly offered Google Apps.
         "One thing that Autodesk has been able to do and why it stayed in its leadership position is it can touch the technology trends."
         Carol Bartz, former Autodesk CEO
 	Yet Bass has hammered on bringing software to the cloud since becoming CEO. He believes the future involves bringing 3D modeling and design to the cloud in the same way that Google Docs now hosts documents in the cloud. 	"One thing that Autodesk has been able to do and why it stayed in its leadership position is it can touch the technology trends," says Carol Bartz, who was the Autodesk's CEO from 1992 to 2006.  "We had to pull the company into the Internet. Carl is pulling the company into cloud services."Helping makers make	Bass is also pulling Autodesk into the Maker Movement. This move can be traced back to 2009 when the company released its first mobile app SketchBook Mobile for iOS. The app garnered more than 1 million downloads in the first 50 days. That level of success prompted Autodesk to roll out more apps for students, professionals and, yes, makers. The company now offers 17 programs under its Personal Creativity category. That category's tagline reads, in part, "Reshape your world. Make a difference. Create something." 	A little over a year ago, Autodesk opened a 27,000-square-foot workshop on San Francisco's Pier 9. It juts off the dock of the city's Embarcadero into the waters of the clay-blue bay. From the outside, Pier 9 looks like most of its neighboring whitewashed piers. Inside, it's a hotbed of makers. 	The two-story workshop is divided into several rooms holding state-of-the-art machines and tools. Here, Autodesk hosts its artist-in-residence program that lets people play with its water jet cutter, CNC router (a computer-controlled cutting machine) and industrial sewing machines. Hanging from the wall is a giant set of electronic googly eyes that look at you wherever you move, a fire-breathing machine and a conference table that swings. One room holds Autodesk's first foray into hardware -- its desktop 3D printer called Ember.

 	Pier 9 is also home to Autodesk's how-to website, Instructables, which it acquired in 2011. Geared toward helping makers create, the site offers a range of lessons from "how to make a solar robot" to "how to kiss." Bass himself has even authored a few Instructables, including "Turning a baseball bat" and, fittingly, "Sharpening a chisel." 	As Bass strolls from room to room in Pier 9, he waves hello and stops to chat with the local makers and ask them about their projects. One man is working on a small part for a lunar lander, another is 3D-printing tiny metal pieces of jewelry that look like delicate swaths of lace.

  	In a sense, Pier 9 is a highfalutin version of Bass' Berkeley workshops. Every year Bass spends extra time in these shops fashioning holiday presents for Autodesk's directors. He's made small sets of audio speakers, 3D-printed metal baskets and other various creations. One of the reasons he does this is to work with and test Autodesk's software. 	"Carl's always been interested in building things even before the Maker Movement was called the Maker Movement," Autodesk board member Beveridge says. "His own interest in making things has allowed him to bring back into the company information about how we can help other people who make things, make them better."

Bass Drive - Carl Martin



























































 








Welcome  











 




Even though the BassDrive has been listed in the catalogue for years, Carl postponed the release of this pedal until we were able to tweak the EQ and crunch to where it could add a warm ‘tube’ sound to modern digital bass amps and actually improve their performance. The new Carl Martin Bass Drive now does exactly that….creating that famous John Entwhistle (The Who) tone … big, round and phat with just the right amount of sustain to place your bass properly in the mix and allow it to ‘pop’ in live and recording situations.  The Drive control blends evenly with your bass tones, rather than sitting on top like so many others, and very naturally maintains a full bottom-end.  Gain, Bass-Mid-Treble, Level Controls look after your sound, and the regulated and switch-able Power Supply (115-240V) provides the Bass Drive with tons of headroom….Carl, is smiling again!



  Download Manual




This is what they say






Hi Soren,
Man the bass drive sounds really good, and very useful in the studio
Jorgen Carlsson, Gov’t Mule
Bassplayer (USA)
The Bass Drive earns every inch of its oversized footprint; three bands of EQ voiced for bass offer a colorful palette of tones, and the grit imparted by the GAIN control ranges from ornery grunt to aggressive grind. With the GAIN, MIDDLE, and HIGH rolled back, the Bass Drive wraps an otherwise raw sterile bass 4-string in Snuggie-like fleece, softening the edges while allowing the bass to breathe. For prog-approved tones, the bumping up the MIDDLE and GAIN fetches a clang close to the edge.
Carl Martin set out to recreate the sounds of classic rock bass gods like John Enstwistle and Jack Bruce. With the Bass Drive, it has delivered a distinguished tone tool capable of empowering the would-be bass deities among us.
Iguitarmag (UK)
Hey tone lovers! Here’s one for the bass players. Issue 15 of Guitar Interactive magazine is out, with a great review and demo of the Carl Martin Bass Drive. Check it out!
http://licklibrary.ceros.com/iguitarmag/issue15/page/179
Bass Guitar Magazine (UK)
A Danish product, it glows encouragingly when you switch it on, rather like the same country’s famous bacon exports under a hot grill, thanks to the 12AX7 tube under the bonnet. As you’d expect from a tube-driven unit, the overdrive you get out of this pedal is warm, smooth and sustained, retaining the bottom end you need while offering convincing mid and high options. This little baby restates a convincing case for tube drives. It’s a solid, conservative, utterly lovely pedal that we want for our very own.

Carl Martin Bass Drive Pedal
Carl Martin has unveiled their new Bass Drive pedal, which the company says has been in the works for several years. Built in Denmark, the pedal employs a 12AX7 in the circuit for classic tube tone growl as well as fatness and extra sustain.
Besides the Level and Gain controls, the Bass Drive has a 3-band EQ for dialing in your tone. It’s also travel-ready as it features a 115-240V switchable built-in main power supply.


SHIPPING POLICYShipping Charges
Shipping charges apply to orders under $199. $14.95 is the usual shipping price for most products under $199, however there can be added shipping costs for over-sized, over-weight shipments, and items shipping to "Beyond Point" areas as outlined below. The customer will be notified of any additional costs before the order is shipped.
Free Shipping over $199

Over-sized / over-weight shipments. We reserve the right to add shipping charges when required. The customer will be notified of any additional costs before the order is shipped.
All purchases qualify for a free shipping allowance. For most orders this allowance will cover the entire shipping cost. In some cases where product price is low and the weight/size of the product is high or large we may need to charge a small shipping charge. If there are any additional shipping costs you only pay the difference between our shipping allowance and the actual cost. We will subsidize most of the extra shipping costs. An example of this is: Behringer products they may cost very little but weight a lot. We will try to post the surcharges on the products at the time of checkout however sometimes we may need to contact you before shipping. If you have any questions please contact us by phone and we will look into the shipping rates for your area. 
"Beyond Point" areas in Canada as outlined below. Shipping to the US is $29.95 and there may be an additional charge for over-sized/over-weight shipments and for the "Beyond Point" areas in the US as outlined below. Some of our products do not ship to the US. Please call us for more details.

Any other areas dictated by our Courier ( Purolator/Canada Xpresspost).

Music reserves the right to revoke this limited time offer at any time.
Shipping Terms and Conditions
If LAMUSIC.CA (we) have your product(s) in stock, we will email you a confirmation notice that the item(s) are ready to be shipped; that notice is our acceptance of your order.

Order Accuracy
We rely on the information you provide through the Web Site, including registration information (name and email address), payment information (credit card numbers and expiration dates), and transaction-related information, which must be true, accurate, current and complete. You will be solely responsible and liable for any and all loss, damage, and additional costs that you, we or any other person may incur as a result of your submission of any false, incorrect or incomplete information or your failure to update your registration information and payment information within 30 days of any change.

Once we receive the backordered items, the order is likely to be shipped to you within 1-2 days of arrival to us. Backorders can occur under circumstances such as; distributors and manufactures do not have immediate stock, the product is special order and/or it has been recently released and supply is not readily available. Under these circumstances, the estimated time of arrival is relative and given to us by our suppliers and so, we rely on the estimated information as a guarantee as well. You will have the option of waiting for the next available shipment or to cancel your order. In this situation, we advise the customer to wait for the shipment because his or her order becomes top priority.

Carl Bass is a former president and chief executive officer of Autodesk, Inc.,[1] a maker of professional 3D design software and consumer applications, and was a co-founder of Ithaca Software,[2] which commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system. Bass has been credited with expanding Autodesk beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product developments[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D model-based design.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Bass was born in New York, New York to a chemist father and school teacher mother.[4] After starting at Cornell University, Bass took a break to build boats, furniture and sculpture in Seattle and Maine for five years. He returned to Cornell and graduated with Bachelor of Arts in mathematics in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1981, Bass co-founded a computer graphics company called Flying Moose Systems and Graphics Ltd., which became Ithaca Software in 1986.[4] The company commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system originally developed at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. Bass served as Ithaca Software’s chief technology officer and CEO.[4] He joined Autodesk when the company acquired Ithaca Software in 1993, serving as the chief architect for AutoCAD.[2] In 1995, Bass was forced out by Autodesk’s then president and CEO Carol Bartz, only to be rehired five months later, after top Autodesk engineers said they needed Bass’s software development skills.[5]
Bass left Autodesk in 1999 to launch Buzzsaw,[6] an online service for management of construction projects, where he served as president and CEO.[2] Bass returned to Autodesk when it acquired the company in 2001.[6] In addition to being the company's president and CEO from 2006 through 2017, Bass held a number of high-level positions at Autodesk, including executive vice president and chief strategy officer (2001 to 2002); senior executive vice president of the Design Solutions Group (2002 to 2004); chief operating officer (2004 to 2006); and interim chief financial officer (2008 to 2009).[7]
Tenure at Autodesk[edit]
In 2006, Carol Bartz stepped down as Autodesk’s president and CEO, naming Bass as her replacement.[8]
During his tenure as CEO, Bass focused on expanding the company beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product development[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D design.[2] He emphasized vertical markets focusing on model-based design, simulation and lifecycle management.[2] Under his direction, Autodesk introduced consumer-oriented products such as SketchBook, a mobile painting and drawing app with more than 7 million users as of Nov. 2011.[9] Bass helped lead the company to develop Building Information Modeling (BIM) and generative design technologies. In March 2008, Autodesk was ranked number 25 on Fast Company's list of "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies."[10]
Bass serves on the Board of Directors of Autodesk, HP Inc., Zendesk Inc., Planet, and Formlabs Inc.[1] He also serves on the board of trustees of the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Art Center College of Design, and California College of the Arts, and is a member of the advisory boards of Cornell Computing and Information Science, UC Berkeley School of Information, and UC Berkeley College of Engineering.[1] He previously served on the board of McAfee and iRise.[4] He currently acts as an advisor to Zoox Inc. and a special advisor to Alphabet CEO Larry Page. [11]
Bass announced that he would be stepping down as Autodesk's CEO effective on February 8, 2017. He remains a board member and special advisor to the company.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Bass owns a workshop near his home in Berkeley, Calif.,[5] where he designs and fabricates objects made from wood, metal and stone. Bass’ projects have included furniture, sculpture and a walk-in wooden rocket ship he built for his children,[13] which is on permanent display at Chabot Science Center.[4]
He is married to Daryl Austern, and they have two children.

Carl Bass is a former president and chief executive officer of Autodesk, Inc.,[1] a maker of professional 3D design software and consumer applications, and was a co-founder of Ithaca Software,[2] which commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system. Bass has been credited with expanding Autodesk beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product developments[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D model-based design.[2]

Early life and education[edit]
Bass was born in New York, New York to a chemist father and school teacher mother.[4] After starting at Cornell University, Bass took a break to build boats, furniture and sculpture in Seattle and Maine for five years. He returned to Cornell and graduated with Bachelor of Arts in mathematics in 1983.[4]
Career[edit]
In 1981, Bass co-founded a computer graphics company called Flying Moose Systems and Graphics Ltd., which became Ithaca Software in 1986.[4] The company commercialized HOOPS, a 3D graphics system originally developed at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. Bass served as Ithaca Software’s chief technology officer and CEO.[4] He joined Autodesk when the company acquired Ithaca Software in 1993, serving as the chief architect for AutoCAD.[2] In 1995, Bass was forced out by Autodesk’s then president and CEO Carol Bartz, only to be rehired five months later, after top Autodesk engineers said they needed Bass’s software development skills.[5]
Bass left Autodesk in 1999 to launch Buzzsaw,[6] an online service for management of construction projects, where he served as president and CEO.[2] Bass returned to Autodesk when it acquired the company in 2001.[6] In addition to being the company's president and CEO from 2006 through 2017, Bass held a number of high-level positions at Autodesk, including executive vice president and chief strategy officer (2001 to 2002); senior executive vice president of the Design Solutions Group (2002 to 2004); chief operating officer (2004 to 2006); and interim chief financial officer (2008 to 2009).[7]
Tenure at Autodesk[edit]
In 2006, Carol Bartz stepped down as Autodesk’s president and CEO, naming Bass as her replacement.[8]
During his tenure as CEO, Bass focused on expanding the company beyond its core AutoCAD software through acquisitions and new product development[3] and transitioning from 2D to 3D design.[2] He emphasized vertical markets focusing on model-based design, simulation and lifecycle management.[2] Under his direction, Autodesk introduced consumer-oriented products such as SketchBook, a mobile painting and drawing app with more than 7 million users as of Nov. 2011.[9] Bass helped lead the company to develop Building Information Modeling (BIM) and generative design technologies. In March 2008, Autodesk was ranked number 25 on Fast Company's list of "The World's 50 Most Innovative Companies."[10]
Bass serves on the Board of Directors of Autodesk, HP Inc., Zendesk Inc., Planet, and Formlabs Inc.[1] He also serves on the board of trustees of the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Art Center College of Design, and California College of the Arts, and is a member of the advisory boards of Cornell Computing and Information Science, UC Berkeley School of Information, and UC Berkeley College of Engineering.[1] He previously served on the board of McAfee and iRise.[4] He currently acts as an advisor to Zoox Inc. and a special advisor to Alphabet CEO Larry Page. [11]
Bass announced that he would be stepping down as Autodesk's CEO effective on February 8, 2017. He remains a board member and special advisor to the company.[12]
Personal life[edit]
Bass owns a workshop near his home in Berkeley, Calif.,[5] where he designs and fabricates objects made from wood, metal and stone. Bass’ projects have included furniture, sculpture and a walk-in wooden rocket ship he built for his children,[13] which is on permanent display at Chabot Science Center.[4]
He is married to Daryl Austern, and they have two children.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
