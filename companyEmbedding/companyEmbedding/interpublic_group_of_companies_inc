IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]

IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]

IPG was founded as McCann-Erickson in September, 1930. In January, 1961, it was renamed Interpublic Group and created the first marketing services management holding company with McCann-Erickson as a subsidiary.[6]
In 2002, IPG suffered a precipitous drop in its stock price and reputation in an accounting scandal. In that year, Interpublic was alleged in violation of the Securities Exchange Act over misrepresentation and artificially inflating its earnings.[7] As of November 18, 2008 (taking into account stock splits), IPG's stock has sold at approximately the same price it was on November 18, 1987.[8]
On August 13, 2002, the Interpublic Group of Companies announced to restate financial statements, due to uncertain economic environment and imbalances in certain accounts containing inter-Company activity and related balance sheet items that warranted further scrutiny.[relevant? – discuss][9] On November 13, the final amount of the restatement was reported to be $181.3 million, which reduced previously reported pre-tax income, substantially all of which is related to periods 2001 and prior reporting periods.[relevant? – discuss][10] On March 6, 2003, IPG restated the third quarter of 2002, after identifying $135.8 million of pre-tax charges relating to asset impairments and other operating expenses at Octagon Motor Sports.[relevant? – discuss][11] On September 15, 2005, IPG announced to restate earnings for fiscal 2000 through 2004, due to problems in accounting for revenue, acquisitions and lease expenses. The company also fired some employees in its investigation of accounting errors and potential misconduct.[relevant? – discuss][12] On March 22, 2006, IPG's financial review process resulted in restatement of 2005 interim periods and the recording of immaterial out-of-period adjustments to fourth quarter 2005 financial results.[relevant? – discuss][13]
Interpublic, working to simplify its structure after its overload of deals in the 1990s and 2000s, did not complete any acquisitions in 2005 and 2006.[citation needed] It disposed of 51 businesses in 2005 and 2006, primarily outside the U.S.; Interpublic said it exited 23 "loss-making international affiliates" in 2006.[14] Interpublic in April 2007 announced it agreed to buy Reprise Media, a search engine marketing firm.[citation needed] In July of that same year, FCB-Ulka Advertising Private Limited, a subsidiary of IPG, was renamed DRAFTFCB+Ulka Advertising Pvt. Ltd.[15]

Interpublic's ad networks serve more than 40 global accounts in 20 countries, including such brands as Nestlé and Coca-Cola. 

The IT budget is finalized in Q3.

The company's FCB and Hill Holliday subsidiaries are profiled separately on this database.

The IT department at Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. is primarily run out of the headquarters in New York, NY, and is handled by a chief executive who oversees the entire department, especially the company's Global Information Services (GIS) division. This division houses staff who handle global telecommunications and run financial planning and budget analysis for various aspects of IT. The main IT department works with executives from its subsidiaries. They share common IT services such as financial and enterprise applications. This group si involved with evaluating BYOD solutions, and currently uses Airwatch as its mobile device management solution. Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. has a number of CIOs running IT for these subsidiaries including MRM, Draftfcb, and Deutsch, a division of Lowe Worldwide. These executives are primarily responsible for IT operations at these locations but report to the GIS division as IT is mostly standardized across IPG with all hardware and software agreements going through corporate IT. 

In general, the GIS division focuses on application development and IT procurement. On the infrastructure side, a team manages a data center located in New York as well as information security and networking. This group will be increasing security spending in enterprise security management, identity and access management, mobile security/contingency, and fraud prevention (currently Ironport). Also in 2013, the company will evaluate federated identity security options. Currently, the company uses policy reviews, data storage inventory, incident response, mobile encryption, and malware software as security measures. The majority of the company's SAP staff works overseas in Europe, with a few in the US. This team is evaluating a possible cloud implementation after addressing concerns in the lagging ability to control and recover data, and assurances around where data resides physically. 
   Many of the contacts in the GIS division work closely with existing security projects. As of Q1 2013, Interpublic plans to increase security spending in enterprise security management, identity and access management, mobile security, storage security, and continuity fraud. It will evaluate the need for a federated identity security and single sign-on initiatives in the next year. Currently, Interpublic has regular policy reviews, inventory of personal employee and customer data, inventory of locations where data is stored, documented incident response process, encryption of mobile devices, malware and virus protection software on all devices in place. 

Interpublic outsources a data center as well as some IT infrastructure operations to Scott Technology Center (STC). The partnership started in 2010 with a three phase build-out of Interpublic's IT infrastructure at STC's Omaha location. The company is also involved in a major virtualization initiative encompassing servers, applications, and desktops. Additionally, the company is using Tracx as a SaaS to gather and analyze its Big Data of social media.
