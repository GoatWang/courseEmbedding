Travers Smith has acted as lead counsel for Medicxi on the fundraising for Medicxi Growth I LP, a new $300 million fund that will focus on growth stage companies in European life sciences.With this new late stage fund, Medicxi will help fill a clear gap in Europe, where talented life sciences entrepreneurs do not have access to as much local financial support as their US-based counterparts to expand exciting opportunities into more mature companies.Medicxi Growth I is a continuation of Medicxi’s pioneering ‘asset-centric’ investment strategy and will be looking to invest in private or public companies with at least one asset in Phase II or beyond that Medicxi believes can become a licenced pharmaceutical product, meeting unmet medical needs.The Travers Smith team was led by Head of Investment Funds Sam Kay, with support from Funds Associate Eilidh Campbell. Tax advice was provided by Tax Partner Emily Clark and Associate Tom Rickford.Speaking about the fundraising Sam Kay said: “We are delighted to have assisted Medicxi on the successful fundraising for Medicxi Growth I LP and it is really exciting to see the fund being supported by heavyweight strategic investors such as the European Investment Fund.”

History




Medicxi is a life sciences-focused investment firm, originally created at Index Ventures, a leading international venture capital firm with offices in London, San Francisco, Geneva, and St. Helier (Jersey).Francesco De Rubertis joined Index at the end of 1997 to launch the firm's life sciences practice and was joined in the following years by three partners: Kevin Johnson, Michèle Ollier and David Grainger. Over the years, Index raised a total of twelve funds, managed with separate life sciences and technology investment teams.In 2012, Index launched sector-specific venture funds for the first time, raising separately Index Ventures VI (technology focus) and Index Life VI (life sciences focus). Global Pharma GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE: GSK) and affiliates of Johnson & Johnson (Janssen; NYSE: JNJ) both partnered with Index by investing in Index Life VI. This was a key step in the path towards the founding of Medicxi as an independent venture firm. (read here)Medicxi started its operations in February 2016, with offices in London, Geneva and St Helier (Jersey). Giuseppe Zocco, co-founder of Index Ventures, joined Medicxi shortly thereafter to help build the firm’s late-stage platform and lead the launch of its first Medicxi Growth fund, MG1. (read here)Currently, the firm is actively investing its 2 most recent funds, Medicxi Ventures 1 (focus on early-stage companies) and Medicxi Growth 1 (focus on later stage companies), in addition to managing the entire portfolio of all prior Index life sciences investments.The firm is led by its five co-founders and Partners: Francesco, Kevin, Michèle, David and Giuseppe. Over the years, the five of them have collectively been involved in starting over seventy companies in several countries.

LONDON, GENEVA and JERSEY, February 2, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --

Medicxi Ventures comprises all of the existing life sciences team, portfolio company investments and life sciences funds of Index Ventures 
GSK and Johnson &  Johnson Innovation expand their commitment to the asset-centric approach 
Index Ventures technology practice remains unchanged 

Medicxi Ventures, a new venture capital firm comprising all of the existing life sciences portfolio companies, funds and team from Index Ventures, today announces the close of Medicxi Ventures 1 (MV1), a new €210 million ($250 million) fund that will focus on early-stage life sciences investments. MV1 will predominantly invest in Europe and principally follow the "asset-centric" strategy pioneered by its partners at Index.
By investing in MV1, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Johnson & Johnson Innovation - JJDC, Inc. (JJDC) have renewed and expanded their commitment to the asset-centric approach, following the prior investment in Index Life 6 (IL-6) alongside other financial investors.
Medicxi Ventures starts its operations as one of the largest independent European life sciences focused investment firms. The Company's mission is to focus on strengthening R&D innovation by providing solutions to unmet medical needs. Collaboration with pharmaceutical companies will continue to be a key strategy helping the firm to deliver on this mission.
Medicxi Ventures will be managed by four General Partners, Francesco De Rubertis, David Grainger, Kevin Johnson and Michèle Ollier, all of whom previously led the life sciences practice of Index Ventures. The four partners will form the executive management of the new firm.
Francesco De Rubertis,  General Partner of Medicxi Ventures, said: "We are excited to take this next step in our evolution as a life sciences focused investment firm. A high percentage of the drugs approved every year by the FDA were discovered in European academic labs. By working in close partnership with academia, biotech and the pharmaceutical industry, we are committed to translating this high quality science in Europe into effective new medicines."
He added: "It has been a privilege working with Neil Rimer, Giuseppe Zocco and the other tech partners at Index Ventures for the last 20 years and we have benefitted from their expertise in investing in and building high growth entrepreneurial companies."
Dr Moncef Slaoui, Chairman Global Vaccines and GSK's representative on Medicxi's Scientific Advisory Board, commented on the announcement:  "We are delighted to support the Medicxi team and this early stage investment fund. We believe in the potential to create an exciting pipeline of new medicine candidates by collaborating and investing with an asset-centric model. The team at Medicxi has a proven track record in partnering with world-class entrepreneurs and scientists to translate disruptive science from academia and industry into new medicines with demonstrable patient benefits."  
Dr Richard Mason, Head, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, London, commented: "Johnson & Johnson Innovation is focused on enabling and advancing all stages of science and technology across the world's most robust innovation ecosystems.  We are optimistic that applying the asset-centric investment model of Medicxi across Europe and beyond will uncover the new and highly differentiated science and technology that is needed to turn early stage research into viable products and patient solutions.  We are delighted to work closely with the Medicxi team to help increase the productivity and likelihood of success for the life sciences innovation community throughout the region. " 
The Scientific Advisory Board of the new fund will include some of the top R&D and business development executives from the two pharmaceutical companies as well as Medicxi-appointed executives. As in IL-6, the two pharmaceutical companies have not received any specific rights to the portfolio companies.
Neil Rimer, co-founder of Index Ventures, said: "The creation of Medicxi Ventures as a new entity is a natural evolution given that Index' life sciences team has been operating autonomously within the firm for several years. Whilst Index and Medicxi will operate independently, we retain close ties and look forward to continuing to share ideas and expertise."

Around 30 founders from our portfolio companies gathered at Index in London last week to hear Qualaroo marketing gurus Sean Ellis and Morgan Brown on growth hacking.


Ellis -- who first coined the term ‘growth hacker’ in 2010 and ran early growth marketing at Dropbox, Eventbrite, LogMeIn and Lookout – has written extensively about why startups, when scrambling for meaningful growth, need to change the rules of traditional marketing channels or innovate outside them. In other words, growth hack.
He kicked off with a caveat: “Growth hacking is experiment-driven, and the things that are working today aren’t going to work tomorrow, and things that worked yesterday, aren’t working today, which is kind of what makes it fun and exciting.”
There are, however, some basic governing principles, he said. “To me, being a marketer in an early-stage startup is all about tapping into the full potential of the business.
“Particularly when you are coming from the outside, you can be a really good marketer on the wrong product, and not be very successful, and you can be not that great of a marketer on a good product, and do really well. So the important thing is to make sure you’re aligned with something that’s got a lot of potential,” he said.
1. Product/Market Fit.
Fundamentally, product/market fit is about having a large group of people who consider your product a must-have, Ellis explained. “Not only is it unsustainable to grow a company that doesn’t have product/market fit, also one of the things Morgan and I found, having analysed not just companies we’ve worked with ourselves - including Dropbox, Eventbrite and LogMeIn - but also by analysing a lot of other companies’ growth engines, is that organic growth was the most important growth driver. And that’s a direct function of product/market fit.
“I boiled [product/market fit] down to being able to measure if the product was really a ‘must have’, [where] I could go in and assess that, just by asking users ‘How would you feel if you could no longer use this product?’
“What I found was that companies where around 40% or more of the people said they’d be very disappointed, tended to do pretty well and companies with less than 40% tended not to do very well. So it became kind of a benchmark for me as a marketer. If I could just get myself into 40%+ companies, then I would have a much better chance of success and probably get more credit than I deserve,” he smiled.
“That points to the necessity, where, if you have less than 40%, you should spend all your time trying to figure out who the people, who consider your product a must-have, are and how to get more of them. Once I get that right concentration of people, then I know how to grow the business. I know that that’s the group of people I should be targeting with the benefit that they’re getting, and also how I should be positioning the product.”
2. Stack the odds.
The next part of the ‘growth pyramid’ is where factors like conversion rate optimisation, the right business model and positioning – essentially the things that optimise the business’s growth engine and user acquisition and retention – come into play, Ellis continued.
“This is about re-orienting or re-calibrating a business, around that must-have benefit that the product gives, because this is what opens up profitable marketing channels. So at LogMeIn, we were doing a lot of search engine marketing - spending about $10k a month - and I was frustrated because we couldn’t scale that spend any more. But when I actually looked at our [marketing] ‘funnel’, the overwhelming majority of people who signed up never actually used our free remote access product at that time.
“When I mapped the funnel, we [found] we were losing people at each step -- including where they came to the website, signed up, downloaded the software, configured firewalls etc -  and so I got to the point where I just knew we weren’t going to be able to scale search spending any more if we didn’t fix this.”
3. Fix leaks.  
Ellis said he and the CEO then made a decision to devote several months to optimising the LogMeIn conversion funnel. “We did all kinds of tests at every step and a lot of qualitative research to find out why people weren’t moving through well, and we improved it probably to the point, where we had 10X more people who signed up actually using the product.  
“While it doesn’t seem like that much of a difference, what it meant from a search engine marketing perspective, was that that $10k spend on all the keywords that we tested, now scaled to around a million dollars a month, and the business was cash flow positive all the way to the IPO. I don’t think that would have happened if we hadn’t spent that time stacking the odds.”
4. Increase desire, decrease friction.
There are two key levers to use to optimise conversions, said Ellis. “It’s about increasing desire, and decreasing friction, a basic formula where:  
DESIRE – FRICTION = CONVERSION RATE
“So you want to identify all points of friction, and anytime you remove friction you’re going to improve conversion rate, and anytime you increase desire, you’re also going to improve conversion rate. You want to work both of those until you essentially start to flatten out in terms of improving that conversion rate,” he advised.  
“Growth has multiple levers…. You want to make sure you experiment with each of those levers to maximise growth rates. When something’s working, you really need to understand that, double down and squeeze the most out of it.”
5. Catalyse sharing.
Ellis arrived at Dropbox about six months after he left LogMeIn, where he’d been able to spend big bucks to drive growth. “But our freemium model at Dropbox was a little different -- we were giving away free space, so there just wasn’t a lot of margin left for acquiring customers,” he said. “We realised we weren’t be able to spend money very effectively to grow the business, but we had all these natural advantages to grow around collaboration and sharing loops that were in the product.
“What we did was catalyse sharing. Sharing was already happening with natural word of mouth and users sharing files with one another across the service. We accelerated this growth engine by introducing  a double-sided referral programme -- essentially a reward for both the referrer and the person who’s learning about the product – and we then did lots of optimisation on those loops. That’s a really brief overview of ultimately how that business has grown to 300m users, not using traditional marketing. But it’s really understanding how that growth was already happening, then building in the right incentives and optimising each of those growth drivers to maximise the potential.”
At that point Brown took over, adding: “The thing with growth hacking and finding these exponential levers, is that the benefits usually go to the first mover. So now referral programmes are everywhere, because everyone’s heard the Dropbox story, but the fact is that today a lot of referral programmes underperform and the ones that work really well, work in the context of the product itself.”
6. Inside the process.
“Rather than trying to take all these different growth hacking successes and apply them as 1-to-1 copies to your business, it’s more effective to go through a process of identifying what the best levers in your business are for growth and then doubling down on them,” Brown said. “And it kind of looks like this:
IDEAS
PRIORITISE
TEST
ANALYSE
OPTIMISE
“So you do a lot of ideating – ideas are the currency of growth. You have to have a big pipeline of ideas constantly.
“Then, of course, time is our most precious asset in a startup, there are millions of things to do, so you have to be rigorous and prioritise them.
“Everything should be tested – it’s relatively easy now, with all the tools that are out there.  
“Then go back and analyse. And, finally, optimise those programs and user flows.
“Then start the process again, over and over,” he said.
7. Growth hacking works for B2B as well as B2C businesses
Non-traditional growth levers aren’t just for consumer-focused companies, continued Brown. “There are B2B companies that do this really well too. The trick with B2B, is that the growth has to be tied into the sales process. Fundamentally if you are running a SaaS/enterprise business, there’s a sales process attached to your growth efforts and sales has a lot of friction. But there are companies which have figured out ways to take this friction out of the process: LinkedIn, Yammer, HubSpot – have all done a really great job.”
Brown went on to cite how inbound marketing and sales platform HubSpot, had worked out how to remove the friction from their acquisition process. “They realised people didn’t want to fill out a lead form to get contacted by a sales-person, but they were definitely interested in [measuring] how they’re doing,” he explained. “People have a couple of main motivators: fear and greed, and if you can play off one of those, you’re setting yourself up to eliciting a response from your target customers .”
Marketing Grader, which, as its name suggests, enables users to grade and improve their marketing, proves that playing off of people’s vanity can work, he said. “People want to see how they’re doing, they like leaderboards. And it’s great lead gen: you ask for their URL /email address, which goes into the sales process, but [as a user] it also makes inherent sense because you are providing the information in order to get back a report that’s really valuable.”
8. Platform Integrations as a Growth Lever.  
When people think of spectacular platform integrations, they usually think about Airbnb/Craigslist, said Brown, but in fact there are probably thousands of platforms a business can integrate with, which all have large concentrations of people who will likely be in your target audience.
“TrialPay did many integrations with different e-commerce platforms and it was a massive win,” he said. Ellis added: “I have one company that I angel invested in, which is still relatively early stage, but they [have] hundreds of thousand of dollars a month in MRR, all through a Salesforce integration. 100% of their customer acquisition is through Salesforce.”
9.  ‘Powered By’ as a Growth Lever.
When you're looking for a growth opportunity sometimes the most obvious ones are right in front of your face, said Brown. “On Qualaroo, we have ‘Powered By Qualaroo’, which is a link back to a landing page, which generates a ton of traffic. (Using a ‘Powered by’ link is one way that companies can get inbound traffic from users who deploy a product to their websites.) I spent months trying to get paid acquisition to work for us. It was very frustrating, it didn't work. And I never really touched this link.
“Then Growthhackers.com ran a case study about people who had done a lot of testing around their 'powered by' link and massively increased their traffic [as a result]. So we did some testing around our link and if you see Qualaroo out in the wild today, it says ‘Not using Qualaroo yet?’.  And that has [led to] a massive boom in the amount of traffic, the number of trials and that type of thing.”
10. Growth is a team sport.
If you are relying on just marketing and sales to be your growth drivers you're only using a couple of cylinders of your overall growth engine, said Brown.
“Growth comes from many different places, and you need engineering and product to be on board. Whether you have a growth team that sits in the product organisation, or you have a team that you put together that has people from different parts of the organisation, but that works together on a regular basis, you need them to catalyse that growth and look for new opportunities outside the traditional sales and marketing channels.”
He also urged companies to “evangelise the experimentation culture, which celebrates failures and middling successes”, share data and ensure people are invested in understanding what their company is doing. “It's important you get everyone on the same page, because some of the best growth levers have nothing to do with marketing at all,” he said.

Center for Media Literacy

Known as product placement, it is an increasingly common practice whereby advertisers pay media makers to use or display their products as props yet never reveal this arrangement as a form of advertising.

Creating their own product placements for good causes reveals the strategy behind the practice.
