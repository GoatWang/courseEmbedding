However, critics have challenged these supportive voices because of organizations’ limited control over the sites’ design and the lack of demonstrated return on investment for social-media endeavors. Using the 26 National Football League (NFL) teams with an official Facebook presence, this study compares how public relations practitioners use the NFL teams’ Web sites and Facebook pages to cultivate relationships with fans using stewardship strategies promoted by public relations literature. Results indicate that the NFL teams overwhelmingly favor their own Web sites for relationship-building endeavors over Facebook for 27 of the study’s 33 measures. Explanations for the divergence from consultants’ advice are discussed and grounded in new-media and sports communication research from various scholarly perspectives.Keywords: online communication, fan communication, relationship buildingAuthors: Kim Foster, Jamie Buning, Zachary Jackson, Dr. Richard WatersIdentifying the best practices of mediacatching: A national survey of media relations practitionersPublic Relations ReviewAuthors: Kim Foster, Meghnaa Tallapragada, Ilin Misaras, Richard WatersEducationNorth Carolina State UniversityMaster of Science (M.S.), CommunicationMaster of Science (M.S.), Communication2009  –  2011Projects/Presentations:Extensive research via focus groups to study the social context of viewing and how it influences men's and women's responses to gendered stereotyping in advertisementsA content analysis on the affects of the mobile phone on doctor-patient relationshipsAn ethical analysis on practices of organizational controlQuantitative research paper on communication and concerns about appearance during pregnancyChristopher Newport UniversityBachelor of Arts, CommunicationBachelor of Arts, Communication2005  –  2009Projects/Presentations:Extensive study of AXE advertisements and how the company constructs gender identities through persuasive advertising ploysPresented at the 2009 Theodore Clevenger Undergraduate Honors Conference Presented at the 8th annual Paideia Student Research ConferenceCertificationsAdWords CertificationJuly 2016  –  July 2017GroupsShopper Insights & Brand ExperienceMedia & Marketing Professionals WorldwideAdvertising AgeDigital Marketing: Social Media, Search, Mobile & moreOnline Ad ProfessionalsDigital Marketingi612:  Minneapolis-Saint Paul Area Interactive Media CommunitySee 7 moreHadoop UsersTech Career ExpoAlpha Kappa Psi Alumni in VirginiaRetail Industry Professionals GroupPath to Purchase InstituteCloudera Hadoop UsersRETAIL EXECS NETWORKSee lessView Kim’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact Kim directlyView Kim’s Full ProfileNot the Kim you’re looking for?

Kim FosterKitchen Supper
May 23, 2017
We are making some changes.
First, we are not taking any more foster kids. We have four kids now, our two foster kids will soon be officially ours. Although I think we could do one more. I always feel like one more, one more! But David feels strongly that we are pretty full-up and busy parenting these kids. He believes we should stop and give what we can to these kids. And do that well.
David is very smart about these things, so I am slowly moving into this way of thinking.
But we aren’t done with being a positive force in the life of foster kids. What I’m about to tell you is a trade-off of sorts. We can stop fostering, but I want to do this one thing….
And David has agreed.

I was inspired by a couple of articles: this New York Times piece from last year, The Power of a Dinner Table, by David Brooks, and this piece, Children on the Cusp: The Transition from Fostercare to Adulthood is Leaving Some Behind, by Camalot Todd in the Las Vegas Sun. They made me want to do something for kids aging out of the system.
The idea – hosting a kitchen supper every Friday night.
Australian Chef, Bill Granger, originally created this concept. He hosted a small supper at his house, sitting in the kitchen, (not the dining room – too formal) on a weeknight to connect with friends. Nothing too fancy, and easy enough to do every week.
Not a dinner party – a supper. Cozy food, a few simple dishes, no appetizers, no crazy desserts. Just good home-cooking and inviting a family or two that we love…
AND – the important bit – opening our supper to aging-out, or aged-out foster kids, who want to hang out, use the wifi, talk to some good people, get welcomed like family, make new family, eat a good meal, know they are connected to other people who aren’t being paid to be with them, feel safe.
That’s it. Just feeling safe and relaxed. Cared about.
We are working with DCFS to make this happen, and will be reaching out to friends to invite them to kitchen supper. We also welcome our friends to reach out to us.

The photos you are looking at were shot by my good friend, artist, photographer, Emily Wilson. (Her work is amazing, please check her out.)
She came for lunch one day, and as it is with photographers, the day became a shoot. And it was so much fun, she came back that evening and shot our first official kitchen supper with Drew Cohen and Scott Seeley, owners of The Writer’s Block, the best bookstore in Vegas, and soon-to-be foster-dads.
Drew came over early and we cooked the dinner together.



It was so much fun, this got me thinking. What if kitchen supper guests could come early and cook with us? Cooking at 5pm, and dinner at 7pm?
Yes, I want to do that. Every week.

So that’s the plan.
Supper every Friday night at our house. Come at 5pm and cook. Come at 7pm and eat together.



Be there for a teen who is moving out into the world alone, without solid family connections.
Tell a kid a funny joke.
Give them a little advice.
Learn to cook something.
Teach someone to cook something.


So thank you, people we love, for being there for our foster kids, and creating all kinds of community for them, as they have moved in and out of our house.
As we close out our foster care license, and adopt our kiddos, and become one big ridiculous family, we want you to join us again on our next adventure…
Being there for aging-out foster kids. At least some of them. As many as we can.
Email us if you’d like to come.
Cook.
Eat.
Drink.
See what happens.
 
_____________________________
If you are in Las Vegas, and we know each other or are connected through friends, and you want to attend a Kitchen Supper, you can email me at kimATFosterEntertainmentDOTnet or text me at 917. 903 1344 to get on the calendar.
More importantly, if you know a foster youth who is in the process of aging-out of the system or has aged-out, and might need a free dinner and a safe place to hang with some cool folks, please get ahold of me.
Motherless
May 2, 2017
 
April 5, 2017
Our caseworker emails us. She is cancelling weekly visitations with our foster kids and their bio parents, Chrissy** and Jay.
Then, a second email comes in. The DA sent the paperwork to the court. The judge signs off. The caseworker calls Chrissy and tells her the hard news.
It’s official. Our foster children’s bio parents have no rights to the kids. That will not change. Our babies are officially freed for adoption.
I sit on that for awhile. I instagram it with a photo of the baby. I write:
It’s official: our kid’s bio mom and dad have lost their parental rights. I am happy for our kids who have a family now, and us, because we love them so much, but that happiness is tempered by knowing the cost of everything that has happened to them. I also am thinking about bio mom, and all that she has lost because her life is a true, true mess. Even bad parents love their babies. And kids still love their parents even when they’re shitty at parenting. Today I am aware of love and family and all it’s sky-high joy, and its complications and contradictions. Onward to adoption.
Then I pick up the phone, find Chrissy’s number and, not knowing what to say, I write:
Hi. How are you?
This is a wide-open question. I have no idea what she’ll say. If she’ll even write back. She just got a job working at 7-11, her first in eight years. I doubt she will hang onto it for long. Predictability, showing up, consistency of any kind is not her strong suit. She is pregnant again, something she told me two weeks ago. If we were to have a visit next week, before it was cancelled, I was going to bring her folic acid and prenatal vitamins. But now, I know, I won’t see her to give them to her, so she won’t have any.
Not that prenatals can stop what might happen to this in-utero baby.
Chrissy says she has to get out of town soon, before she starts showing, so DCFS doesn’t take her baby. And she is right, of course. Now that her rights have been taken away, every baby she has in Nevada will be taken from her. DCFS will, by law, NOT have to go through a protracted reunification process.
They will never let her keep this baby. Nor should they.
So, she’ll move, disappear, hide, and fuck-up this kid as long as she can get away with it. Until they, or some agency in another state, find her again.
She texts me back from a number I don’t recognize.
Hey Kim, this is my state phone. I can only cry and call. I can’t get video/picture mail on here….But I’m doing okay.
She goes on to blame her caseworker for her losing the kids. She tells me she feels “stupid” about the whole thing. Like it was a terrible practical joke and she fell for it.
She goes dark for a few days and I check in again.
How are you?
Okay, she writes back.
She asks me to send photos of the kids to yet another number I don’t recognize. The phone issue has thrown her life into chaos. Or really, her life is in chaos and the phone thing is a symptom. Chrissy and Jay routinely have their phones stolen and it takes days into weeks to wrangle new ones.
I shoot photos all weekend, intending them for her. When Edie, feelings hurt, says “Why aren’t you taking photos of me?” I tell her, “These are for Chrissy.”
She gets it, but stomps away.
But I never get to send them. I never get to text Chrissy at all.
In fact, these are the last conversations I have with her.
 
April 8
My children’s bio mother dies.
I get the call around 3:30pm the day after. It’s Jay. Jay is the baby’s bio dad, but has been in our son’s life for as long as he can remember. Jay is hysterical. He is so upset I can’t tell whether he is laughing or crying, whether this is a happy call or a sad one. But he never calls me like this, so it can’t be good.
We were watching movies, he tells me. Chrissy, Jay, and her fiancee, all watching movies together.
I’m listening. I’m pacing in the street barefoot, scared to be in the house in case the kids might see my face and demand to know what’s happening. They want to be in the middle of everything.
We thought she fell asleep…I tried to wake her up….but blood came out of her mouth, he can barely get the words out.
I gave her CPR, but at the hospital she was brain dead. They let her go….
I’m stunned and freaked out. I don’t know why, but it hits me hard, like I’m being impaled through the gut. I feel the world go gray. The sorrow I feel for her – 28-years-old – life over, never achieving much (except for these kids) is a hard nugget in the middle of me.
How will I tell our boy? I think.
Tell me the truth, I say in my most serious voice, Was she doing drugs? Drugs she wasn’t supposed to be doing?
I know the answer.
Yes. 
What?
Morphine….I told her not to take those anymore. I told her. 
Jesus. How do you get to be 28-years-old and popping morphine while you are hanging out watching movies? While you are pregnant? How does that happen? How does it fall apart like that so fast?
He says the end for her was losing the kids.
Are you saying she did this on purpose? I ask. I’m defensive.
Is this on me? I’m thinking.
No, No I don’t think so, he says, but he is bewildered, not sure of anything.
I told her she can have a relationship wth the kids, Jason, I say.
…Even though her rights were terminated. I told her. Didn’t she know that?
Yes…I don’t know…
He cries some more.
The next thing you know I’m talking to David in the bedroom, telling him about her. And I start to cry, hard, like I come undone. David pulls me in and I cry into his shoulder. The kids are all out on the trampoline, just outside the bedroom door, laughing, jumping.
Oblivious.
 
April 11
I’m thinking a lot about how the funeral home won’t talk to me. I mean, I’m no one to them.
Stacy, at the funeral home, is a complete bitch to me, after she finally takes my call. Obviously the drug addicts have been calling the funeral home and she is done with them.
Jay stops returning my calls.
I won’t call Chrissy’s meth-head-biker-fiancee, or whatever he is, who has beaten her up in the past. I feel the danger of him from across town. He scares me.
I remember when Chrissy sent me the photos. What he had done to her face and body – bruises, welts, soft brown and blue indentations in her skin. And then, two days later, she brings him to a weekly visit with the kids at McDonalds. He gets loud and in her face while she’s holding the baby, and it so freaks me out, I run into the play area, snatch the baby and shut down the visit. From then on, we meet for supervised visits at the Visitation Center at DCFS.
Now his Facebook says they are married. Hers says she is engaged. Jay tells me in a text he was still with Chrissy. He says they all live together in the same roach-infested trailer park. It’s all just quagmire and deception, their whole lives. But I don’t want to speak to the meth-biker-dude because she overdosed on his watch. I want to blame him for the shitty choices she’s made that have impacted her kids, but I know it’s all her. She made these choices. He is only a recent player.
I wonder in my journal if anyone will show up for Chrissy. If there will be a service. A celebration to remember her, all the light she put into the world before her light went out, before drugs and abuse and the shitty life she led with her drug-addicted friends and her torn relationships.
I want to celebrate her some way. I want the kids to see her celebrated.
But Funeral-Home-Stacy is not letting me near Chrissy.
Then, the biker-meth-head-abuser-fiance-husband calls me. He calls me on her temp phone, but because I had put her in my contacts, her name is blinking out at me.
Like she is talking to me from the dead.
 
April 19
I have Chrissy’s sister here. Can she speak with you?
I am a known bio parent Facebook stalker. It’s a gift and a curse.  I do it with all my foster kids. Sometimes it gives me an idea where the kids come from, and how the parents are faring. After Chrissy dies, I’m on Facebook checking out meth-head biker dude’s feed. I see that her sister, Jane, has commented on a post where meth-head-abuser-biker has announced his fake marriage to Chrissy. Jane, identifies herself as Chrissy’s sister, and asks him to PM her.
I do what any self-respecting stalker would do and I follow her page back to her profile. Jane is so pretty, older than bio mom. She has three nearly-grown, beautiful kids. She has a business. She goes to school. She is in a relationship. She has drinks out with girlfriends. You can tell she loves the hell out of her kids. Her life looks insanely normal – I wonder how many strings Chrissy cut before Jane pulled up stakes and refused to let Chrissy bring her down.
Jane is crying on the phone.
She is surrounded by crazy people in the trailer park. She is looking for her mother’s ashes, which Chrissy stole years ago, hording them in her piles of junk. She is surrounded by the crazy I know so well. Meth-head-abuser-biker dude says Jay killed Chrissy. Jay says meth-head-abusive-biker dude pushed pills down her throat. Jane has to threaten to call the police to get the crazy people to turn over her mother’s ashes.
I can tell Jane is drowning. That she had no idea Chrissy’s life fell so far down the hole. It is all a horrible shock.
And she has no idea where Chrissy’s kids are. She tries calling DCFS, but they shut her out. They tell her Chrissy’s rights are terminated, as are the rights of the rest of the family. Emma’s Law prevents biological families from appearing out of the woodwork and claiming kids who are already settled into families. DCFS tells her nothing. Jay tells her he supports us adopting the kids. But she wants to see them.
I think she needs to see them. With her own eyes. I think she imagines them in the trailer park with her mother’s ashes.
 
April 20
Jane and I connect on Facebook and I see a post where she asks for prayers for my kids. The post is from days ago before we talk on the phone, before she knows the kids are okay. I so get why she is scared for them, but seeing the post rattles me. People send prayers. Some woman named Laurie writes, I’d take them in a heart beat! And I’m thinking, Yo, Laurie, these are my kids. These are my friggin’ kids. You can’t have my kids, Laurie.
Poor Laurie. She’s just trying to be sweet. I mean, I would probably say the same thing.
But I’m still mad and crazy-scared, so I take to my journal and I write down, intensely and with so much fear and ferocity, all the ways we have become family to each other, and it occurs to me, Jane will try to take my kids. (How could she not? I mean my kids are awesome.) And it fills me with such fear and dread and anger that I can barely breathe. I walk around like I have a lightning rod through me. I can’t sit because I feel like I should be doing something. I pace, and I’m short with the kids, and I picture my life without them all and I feel like my lungs will explode.
I take to a foster parent Facebook group and ask, Can they take my kids?
I get all sorts of paranoid, guarded answers about protecting the kids, and circling the wagons, and Emma’s Law, and hiring lawyers and, shutting out the bio family, and being at the will of Family Court judges, and all of it feels weird and hostile and unnecessary.
And then a wise lady named, Wren writes, ....my kid’s bio grandma was at our adoption, but we are weird that way.
And David says, Most of the time, things work out okay.
And these two things set me right: Most of the time things work out okay, and I want to be weird that way.
So I decide: My goal is to have my kid’s bio family at our adoption.
We invite jane to our house. I send her my address and ask her to please not give it to the meth-head-abuser-biker-fiance and the others and she writes back, I am never speaking to them again in my life…I don’t want them near those kids.
I like her before I even meet her.
 
April 21
It’s the middle of the night. The night before Jane, and a few other family members, come to our house. I can’t sleep.
I’m scared to death they will try to take them from us.
It’s easier to be angry, then sad. Because the saddness is so much.
 
April 22
I mean to make the bio family breakfast, but I can’t pull it together.
But the house is clean and I haven’t spilled tea down the front of me. The kids are relatively clean. David is mountain biking, but he calls me 4 times during the morning, so I know he is eager too. I tell myself to be open, like wide open, to expect the best of people, and I remember that these are the family of my children and I will love them because I love the kids, and they, and we, are all connected.
When I change my mindset and think of them, as all of us, being on the same team, I feel the love coming out of me. This is the right way to go. I want to hug these people.
I should’ve done this more in my life, I think. Note to self for the future.
They say they will be here between 8:30 and 9am. They are at the door at the crack of 8:30, so I know they are eager too.
There are a bunch of them. Jane, Chrissy’s sister, Jill, Chrissy’s godmother, Annie, Chrissy’s cousin, and her partner Billy and her 5-year-old son. The boys – newly minted cousins – run off together, barely heard from again.
We hug. We introduce. We have small talk where we let each other know we are normal and nice, and then Jane suggests we sit out on the patio, and I’m mortified because I haven’t dusted off the cushions, but I see they do not care. Like they truly do not care about my housekeeping. They are not judging me. They make me at ease in my own home. They are broads. I see it, especially Chrissy’s godmother. They are spirited, strong women, kind, loving, open. I love them before they even sit on my dusty patio furniture.
And we just start talking. And it’s not dumb conversations. We talk about the kids, what they’ve been through. We talk about Chrissy’s childhood. Tonapah, where it all seemed to go wrong for her. We talked about how they saw the photos of the kids on Facebook (the pics I took and sent Chrissy) and how they thought the kids were okay with their mother. We talked about how the coroner said she wasn’t really pregnant. So many lies, uncovered, excavated and seen for the truth. We talked about how they had to create space for themselves away from Chrissy, because she was so unhealthy. They talked about how hard that struggle was and the guilt they have now. We are all asking, Could we have done more?, but every answer we turn to, the answer is no. She was so far gone.
Then, because they are so open, we start talking about the kids and the future.
Do you want to adopt them? Jane asks.
Is that what you and David want?
Yes, we want to adopt them, I say. We love them.
They’re our babies…I say.
And then I add: But we want your blessing. We want you to be there at the adoption. We want you in the their lives and our lives.
And here’s where this plays like a movie. There is hugging and crying, and this understanding that out of all the shit, out of all the crazy ugliness, something good – something really good and healthy – has come.
There is never a funeral. We choose to honor Chrissy this way.
 
April 24
So lost.
These are the last words Jay texts me. His phone is stolen, he says, so we are texting on his “Obama Phone”, no videos and photos.
I text. I offer to meet him so he can see the kids. I tell him our boy would like to visit, that it would good for both of them to process the loss of Chrissy together.
He never texts back.
I think how lucky he is to be able to see these kids, after his rights have been terminated, and how stupid he is for not taking me up on it.
His loss. Big time. Done texting.
For now.
He is not their only biological family anymore.
 
April 26
For our boy, and eventually the baby, this grief thing is going to be a life-long process.
He doesn’t have the immediate questions, like who will put me to sleep? Or who will feed me?  Chrissy never did any of those things, that he remembers. But the long, on-going questions, they linger.
He sleeps with the blanket Chrissy and Jay gave him. He sleeps with “Puppy”, a soft, floppy-eared dog they gave him during one of their visits at DCFS. I make him a memory box with photos and things I kept from her, that he mostly likes to sit in.
He doesn’t talk about it much the first few weeks, even though I check in often, but now he is starting to ask the big questions. Like, why?
I tell him, Mommy was very sick, and she took medicine to help her pain, but she took too much. She was watching a movie, and went to sleep and her body stopped working.
Someday we will tell him everything. But not now.
He wants to know about her heart, and her brain, and how they slowed down and stopped working. He wants to know about the movie.
He says with a lot of confidence, People can die while watching movies.
And so now we have to unravel the connections between watching movies and dying. I wonder if I was too specific? We are trying to decipher what he is thinking as he says things. I’m trying to find the right words.
He says to David, I’ll have to get a new family if you and Mommy and Lucy and Edie die….
David answers him, We won’t die for a long, long time. You will always be with us. We will always love you.
Now we have to stay alive and keep that promise.
Pressure.
 
April 27
I see him walking his scooter on the street, going to a friend’s house. He is making the ASL sign for “I love you.” He, Chrissy and Jay used to say goodbye at visits with that sign, their hands touching.
Chrissy is never too far away.
 
April 28
This is so weird to write – I realize how much I miss Chrissy.
Half the time, our relationship was me railing at her, in my head, for her erratic drug addict behavior, for hurting our boy at visits by her various absurd and toxic actions. But Chrissy and I had this one thing that bonded us – me sending her photos and videos of the kids.
I started doing it for her. I kept doing it, partly, for me.
I want to share these moments with someone. I want someone else to see the baby saying new words, like “headband” and our boy tearing it up on the BMX track. I want to send someone 32 videos  of the baby saying, abo-cow-doe (avocado) and love it as much as I do.
David might kill me if I send him 32 videos of the kids, while he’s working, but Chrissy had hours to fill and wanted to see them as much as I wanted to send them. One mom to another.
I missed that when she died, the way we bonded together over the kids.
But then Jane steps in. She wants to see tons of pics of the kids. She wants to make up for lost years. She wants to be in their lives. She wants them to mean something to her, and her to them.
So I send them to Jane now. Maybe not 32 videos a day, but enough. And if it annoys her, she hasn’t complained.
And a hole in me has been patched.
 
April 30
We are getting ready to go to the park with Annie and our boy’s newly-found cousin, who he adores. We are all making good on the promise to stay in touch, send photos, be present in each other’s lives. More family = more love, the whole thing.
He is asking me about babies, and I tell him they grow in mommy’s tummies.
I didn’t grow in a tummy.
Yes, you did, I say.
You grew in Mommy Chrissy’s tummy.
No, I didn’t, he says. I’m from Child Haven.
He is talking about the emergency shelter in Vegas where kids live until they are reunited with birth parents or move to foster homes. He had done two long hard stints there.
No baby, you don’t remember but when you were very little you came from Chrissy’s tummy.
No, Mommy, I grew in Child Haven.
And then he skips away, and I let him go.
He has the last word on his own life.

April 27, 2017
 
On a foster parent FB group, a first-time foster parent said she was nervous about meeting her kiddo’s bio mom for the first time. She asked for advice. A lot of the conversation was about whether you should give out your email and cell to bio parents, and what was safe and not. 
This is what I wrote.** It’s as much advice as it is a reminder to myself. 
I think it’s important to remember that you might be the only healthy person in bio mom’s life. That means you are there for the kids first, of course, but also for her. I expect that every mom wants to be heard and understood, so I try to listen and give her love even when she is misguided and hard to handle. I don’t believe in “NEVER give her your cell” or “NEVER NEVER give them too much, they’ll take advantage.” You have to go into it heart first and decide what to do based on that specific mom or dad. Every bio parent is different.
We’ve had a bio mom that we’ve let come to the house and see the kids whenever she wanted. We’ve helped bio moms get jobs, and picked them up from prison at 3am, and arranged a place for them to stay. Today, I spent the morning calling a non-biological father figure in my foster son’s life trying to arrange a visit because I think it would help my son process some things he has questions about. We do this, even though every single right dad has, as the baby’s dad, has been terminated. 
Because relationships aren’t legalities.
Some parents we’ve pushed out, giving them tough love, because they were so unhealthy and messed up, because they didn’t know boundaries and needed us to teach them. But I’ve always sent pics, stayed connected and listened. I always remember I have their babies and how down-right terrifying that must be for them. 
I always give my cell if they want it. I text photos and videos. Our current foster son’s bio mom died and I realized after, how much I missed sending her pics and videos. We spent a lot of time loving the kids in our own way. I mean, who wants to see 1,000 videos of a baby playing peek-a-boo? Only the other mama. That was ours. We shared that.
Funny, I thought I was doing that for her, sending all those pics to help her stay connected. Wrong. It may have started that way, but really I got so much out of it, and now, I miss the hell out of it. And, remarkably, her. 
If you love the kids, you have to love the bios, even if you don’t love the things they do or the ways they hurt themselves and the kids. You can protect the kids and yourself – and you should, ferociously – but you can do that and be loving at the same time.
Mostly, trust your heart. Stay open. Love. Love. Love. 
 
 
**The piece I originally wrote has been edited for better readability here, but not much.
Roachland
January 5, 2017
 
We are at a Jack-in-the-Box.
It’s me, David, our foster kid’s bio mom and the baby’s dad. We are stuffed into a tiny booth. A group of school kids are all around us, gossiping and drinking cokes. Every booth is filled with people. A bunch of kids hang out by the soda machine. It is loud and raucous. Not the kind of environment you imagine for talking about such a serious thing.
Mom is late. She is always late. And not by a little. Not like 5 minutes or something. She is 45 minutes late to everything.  But I get why she is late, dragging her feet. This is not going to be fun.
We are a half hour into the wait and David and I are sipping on coffee, talking to bio dad about what it’s like to work as one of the costumed characters on the Strip. He shows us photos of him dressed as the Hulk or Captain American or whomever, and tells us he can make $90 for a few hours work.
“That’s pretty good money,” I think. Better than I thought they did.
He is living in a weekly hotel, dubbed “Roachland” on TripAdvisor, because it’s overrun with roaches, bed bugs and the occasional scorpion.  Like, I’m not sure the reviews could be any worse. Reviewers are writing “Run! before the roaches get you!” He lives with a few other people in a one bedroom there. When someone leaves, he will bring bio mom in, so she can live in Roachland too. I get this vision of my foster kids living there. It makes me scared for them, and maybe scared for all the other kids I know are living in Roachland.
Bio mom shows up. But she doesn’t come in. She stalks the sidewalk in front of the door. She smokes and stalks. She is palpably nervous. Bio dad goes out to her. They stay outside, talking and stalking until she drops her butt on the ground and comes in.
We are negotiating the open adoption of the boy and the baby. She starts to cry before she sits down. Bio dad grabs her leg in support. I grab her hand. I don’t have any words to describe this moment, except that she is giving her children to us. But it is not a gift. She would take them back to live in Roachland in a minute. She knows the courts will take away her parental rights in March.An open adoption would be her only hope of seeing them, of having contact. She is stuck between two hard, unwavering places.
We talk for a bit about the kids, and I show her a video of the baby trying to say the word “pumpkin” which comes out “pom-pom”. It is so ridiculously adorable, we all have to laugh, and it pops the boil of the moment, and gives us space to breathe.
Then, we do the business. We meter out the terms of the open adoption. They get pics and videos of the kids, and updates on how they are. And visits, when the children want to visit. We say, it is up to the kids, not either set of parents. They want every holiday with the kids. They want us to give them overnights with the kids. They want to join us for Christmas dinner and birthday parties. They know these things cannot be promised, but mom cries when she finds out we won’t be co-parenting, making decisions together, sharing the children.
She cries, the hard relentless, can’t catch your breath crying. Head in her hands. Tears on the table. Bio dad, squeezes her knee some more. He is wiping his eyes. I hold her hands with both of my hands now, as if that will hold her from falling off the cliff of her despair. We are locked in this moment. All connected, but also at odds with each other. We are the perfect definition of “frenemies.”
And then bio dad says he just wants the kids to be happy. It is part selflessness and love, and part experience. He has already lost all of his other children. But these are the first for bio mom. She can’t breathe or continue on.
My heart hurts for her. But it also hurts for the kids. Their story isn’t just about poverty. It’s about willful neglect, constant chaos, homelessness and transience. Their story is about drug addiction, mental illness, and family dysfunction so thick and stubbornly intergenerational that won’t shake out over 100 years.
I had practiced for this moment. There is a part of me, an adopted child myself, that feels her pain. Sometimes, when I least expect it, I feel on some visceral, invisible wavelength that she might be my bio mom, and feel all the ghost feelings I imagine my bio mom felt. It is classic Transference 101. These feelings make me want to forgive all her sins against the kids, and hold her and tell her it will be okay, and invite her to Christmas dinner. But I know that’s me. That’s my shitty-ass baggage that I carry around like a tramp on a train.
What I really need to do here, and I know it, is offer her compassion and my empathy, while protecting her children from her. We need to save the children first – David reminds me of this often. And she needs to save herself, if she even can. So, I had to practice for this moment. I opened up this giant well inside me to hold her feelings, to see them, and take them in, and deliver back to her, kindness, love and listening. But I make it my mission to keep her feelings in the well.
I am all boundaries.
I muster all of my directness, and tell her what we were prepared to give and not give. We can have visits as long as the kids want them, and when they want them. As long as it is good for them. As long as they are not hurt. We cannot promise any of these visits in a contract. But we will make it happen, if they want them. We will send videos and pictures. I always do, several times a week. I feel happy to share these with her. This is easy to give, with no pain to the kids.
This part of it is one mom to another mom. I won’t take that away from her.
They listen and absorb. They stop crying. There is banter now. Some lightness in the middle of the storm. A mention of the baby and how she is the spitting image of her bio dad. We smile, all together, just thinking of her. No matter what, we have this one ginormous thing together – we all love the hell out of those kids.
This unites us always.
Somehow, we all see this. We decide to sit on things. Think about them. But we also silently agree to proceed. We hug. I tell bio mom to text me later if she needs to talk. She will. She has no-one in her life besides bio dad, and they are no longer together. She needs to talk sometimes, and she calls me when she does.
David and I leave Jack-In-The-Box.
They stand outside and smoke.
It takes me days to shake off their sadness.
This Weird Little Fucker of a Day
November 10, 2016
 
This day. This weird little fucker of a day.
Trump wins the Presidency. And I wake up and my girlfriend comes over crying. I’m not crying, because I can’t even feel it and all its ramifications. I haven’t even had caffeine. I feel nothing but the movement of the day plugging away. David, always the Aussie, is shocked and pummeled too, but cracking jokes about Americans. We deserve it. Still, I say, maybe you should become a citizen, because, well, you never know…
I mean, now, we don’t really know what could happen.
Lucy wants me to do her hair, and make her a salad for lunch. She will eat out of the vending machine if I don’t. School vending machines might be worse than Trump, I think. I get on the salad. I talk to her about the election as I chop. She tells me her best friend is a Republican, and a Trump supporter, and she had no idea. She is processing this and what it means. Does it mean anything? I don’t know. I thought only white people like Trump, she says. Her best friend is black. After school, she tells me they talked about the election in every class, in her school which is heavily Mexican, and that kids talked losing their parents to deportation, losing their homes and businesses if one parent is sent back, losing their insurance when Obamacare is repealed.
They cried at their desks.
The baby wakes up this morning, smiling. Happy as Larry. And when I look at her, I realize she has no idea half the country is sad and shocked and gobsmacked. And because I can’t explain my deflated feelings to her toddler mind, I snuggle her soft, warm, chubby body. I giggle when she giggles. I make myself. We lay together, waking up for a few minutes, happy to be together. She brings a relief but really, I have to keep smiling for her, or she will think it’s her. Because babies always think it’s them. They take the blame. So I smile, and cuddle and laugh.
This weird little fucker of a day goes on. It has to.
Our boy has a visit with his bio mom today – if she shows up – and he is lit up, a fire rod, electrified, in flames. A mess. And his caseworker comes. I am expecting her, and the house is kinda clean. But she sees him flipping out, sees how these visits light him up. She sees him play with the baby too hard, destroy things, jump off tables and slam himself into the sofa. How he won’t listen to me. I don’t want him to grow up to be the boy who can’t listen to other people. I don’t want him to be rough in all hs relationships. Like Trump. I want him to have good connections to people. But he can’t control all the bad stuff inside. Not all the time.
Not yet.
And our neighbor next store locks himself out of the house, so we were all there trying to pick his lock with a credit card and a butter knife. Then, a neighbor, a Trump supporter comes by on his bike, and does it. Bang. Bang. Opens that door. It’s like the Trump people can make anything happen today. I think, such a nice guy. Is he racist, xenophobic, homophobic, sexist and he’s just hiding it from me, while he rides in to help a neighbor in need? How can he be so nice and filled with hate at the same time? Is that even possible? I look at everyone now, staring at them, as if I can see who they voted for, as if that tells me who they are. I mean, doesn’t it say who they are?
Or am I the bigot relying on stereotypes to categorize people? Ugh.
And then, I take the little ones to school and the boy won’t let me leave. He falls into me, kissing my face, begging me to stay. Clinging to me in my arms for the longest hugs. A half hour before, he was so angry he wanted to punch me, now he is submerged into me. The visits are hard business. So much emotional gravel that gets turned over. His life, his brain and his heart are a tumult, a struggle. I feel it so hard that I can’t even care about who sits in the big White House. I have to fix this here, I think. This little tiny stuff is ours to overhaul. And mold. And work with. Things aren’t right.
I still haven’t had caffeine.
And Edie is awake and hungry and needs food. So I provide it. I have to teach her what has happened the night before. I have proof positive now to show her that we live in a place that needs work. Needs to be overhauled. Needs to be molded. Things aren’t right. And when she wants answers, I say start here. Start on this street. Start in this family. Start in your girl scout troop. Start with strangers you meet. Start here. Be kind. Listen more than talk. Be open to change. Tell your own stories loudly. Listen to other people’s.
I get some tea. Finally. I let that seep in.
And I call my mom, and it starts as I hear her voice, before I even say hello. The only thing she can eat on the menu at the home where she lives is pot roast and she’s sick of pot roast. Would you want to eat pot roast every day? And Trump is a jerk, but at least Hillary didn’t win. Then she tells me she hates the lady at the bank, and the guy who runs her home, and Hillary, who should be in jail, and the country, and the world, and everything in it. It’s the computers fault, she says. If we didn’t have computers….Then she reminds me she is alone, and that because I have so many kids she is on the bottom of my list, and I choose to put her at the bottom, because I have so many kids, and she might as well die. That’s right, die. It would be better for her and for everyone, she explains. (This reminds me of my grandmother, who in the throws of Alzheimers, used to say she would die if I left the house.) Mom is 86. She has so many muddled, anxious, obsessive thoughts. This catches my heart. I worry for her. I visit. But she won’t live here and I can’t live there. “You moved away…You had too many kids,” she tells me over and over. Also, and she’d want me to tell you this – it pisses her off that Hillary kept everyone waiting for her concession speech because she didn’t think she would lose.
Arrogant women are the worst.
I’m not crying. I’m not even angry. On the surface anyway. I can hardly look at social media because it’s everyone’s anger bleeding all over everything, people yelling and lecturing, and I don’t want everyone else’s anger to be my anger, because anger is a burden to carry. I spend a lot of time processing it on a regular day, so I do not have to hump it around on my back like broken old hunch back.
And truth be told, I don’t have even one tiny fucker of a moment to dwell on this election. Or our bigoted President-elect. It is what it is. I have work to do. Things are not right. There are things here in my perimeter that need to be overhauled. Little people that must be molded. Loneliness that must be mended. Love that must be spread. Peace that must be given. Pain that must be healed. Mistakes that must be fixed.
And I’m just gonna keep at it.

234 Traumas & 3,000 Feelings Ago
October 21, 2016
 
The other night David and I had a hard talk.
It was about four kids, and how exhausting and hard and crazy it all was. How we were up before light, and exhausted and half asleep trying to binge watch something in the evening….remember when we got to binge watch TV, babe? And how we are fighting for moments alone together – when the walk-in bedroom closet is the only place – and struggling to connect, and struggling to finish a conversation, and struggling to meet the huge needs of all our kids, how our kids get so much needier when the foster kids come in, how they all need individual love, how we break apart and soothe them each individually to make sure everyone has enough.
We held hands across the pillow, a sick kid in between us, a metaphor, and wondered if we had enough, to keep us going, to keep or marriage from slowly, inching toward an abyss, and dropping off, without anyone really knowing why it slipped over the edge.
They seemed so happy…. the people would say.
We didn’t stop holding hands.
Two is easier than four. Maybe we should’ve just left well enough alone…WHAT THE HELL DID WE DO????
Then, unable to think about it anymore, we fell asleep. Nothing was parsed out. It was left hanging there between us.
The next day started with the usual business. No time to revisit feelings. There were lunches to pack, faces to wash, foreheads to kiss, problems to untangle. Work, writing, shopping, stacks of paperwork I’ve been putting off for weeks. Two ballet classes, an art class, the little ones’ visit with bio mom, lots of driving from here to there. Every section of the schedule fitting like a tight-ass puzzle of interlocking parts.
And then a call on the road. His bio mom wasn’t coming. He ran to me in the schoolyard, calling my name, hugging my legs. The next thing he said was, “Are we having a visit today?”
I told him no. Hugged him, and said I was sorry. He pretended it didn’t matter and changed the subject. We left it all to be unpacked for later, in the wee hours of the night, in the slanted quiet moments of the day, when he could hear it and speak it and move on from it.
Sigh. Sometimes being a foster parent makes you feel like a placeholder. Like the bio parents are taunting you, “Hey thanks for taking care of my kiddos, and dealing with a whole lotta shit, and creating a quagmire in your life, and fucking with your marriage, so I can do my thing in peace over here….” But sometimes it’s like this mission, where you see what it all really means – How you are the only people who are calm and predictable in a kid’s life. How you are the only ones who show up when you are expected to show up. How you are the people who do exactly as you say you will do and a kid starts to understand this is as normal. His normal. And you know, at seven months into this relationship with these kiddos, he is starting to expect that kind of normal, and he is already a less damaged person in the world because of it.
And you remember why there are so many reasons four is good.
These tiny little wins matter.
David and I are okay. Way better than okay. We make sure of it. This moment, the one in the bed with all the hand holding, happened two weeks ago, and we’ve talked it through, created a plan to make it easier on us, and burned through it to the other side. I found my description of it sitting on the computer this morning. I barely even remember the serious tones that I wrote here. It was 234 traumas and 3,000 feelings ago.
We move fast.
We make choices. Like adding more kids to the family. (Maybe we will even add more after this…There has been talk.) Sometimes these decisions feel like weights, and sometimes they set us free. Choosing to have these two join our older two feels sometimes like we threw ourselves into the eye of a tornado.
But mostly, it feels like we are all so good for each other.
The In-Between
September 22, 2016
 
We are at a pool party.  Our lovely friends are there. There is laughing, and chatting and a clinging to the end of Summer.
Just a little longer. One more dive off the board.
A girl, about 7, is swimming with our foster son.
“Where is your Mom,”? I hear her ask.
He points to me, sitting on the edge, my feet dangling. The baby is between my knees, sitting on a shallow step, slapping the water.
“No, I mean, where is your Mom?…your real Mom?”
Our boy points again at me, as if she didn’t catch it the first time.
I know what’s going to happen next. First, because I’m adopted, and I’ve answered this line of questioning many times in my life. Also, because I have no idea what he will say, and I’m free-falling a bit, knowing I will simply back up whatever he says, but not knowing what to expect.
We’ll see how this goes…
This is the first time we have done this, answered these pointed, specific questions from a kid. Grown-ups are more coy. They want to hear the hardship tale and the happy ending. But they can handle a No or an “I’m sorry, I can’t.” Kids are different. If they want to know the nitty-gritty of your shit, they’ll keep on asking you until they drive you to your knees. They give zero fucks if they offend your sensibilities. So, I’m freakin’.
But the boy has no idea what the girl is talking about.
“That’s my Mom,” he says, and kind of blows her off, blowing bubbles into the water. He gets she is getting at something, but he isn’t quite sure what.
“That’s not your Mom,” the girls says with so much clarity and confidence in her voice.
“You are a foster kid.”
Boom. She said the words.
I take a breath and hold it. But I let it go when I see his blank stare, and I realize he has no idea he is a foster kid, or even what a foster kid is. And since our last name is Foster, this also confuses the issue altogether. Like, maybe he is a Foster kid, like all of my kids.
This makes me smile.
I step in then. I say to the little girl, “I’m his Mommy.” I say it loud and strong so he hears, and he looks at me like, “duh”.
“The rest is hard to explain,” I say to her gently, when she looks like she might challenge me.
“He has a lot of people who love him.”
This seems to satisfy her and she swims away, the boy after her.
There. That’s settled. For now.
Our family exists in the undefinable in-between – until some court makes it permanent, or doesn’t. Until then, these two are ours and not ours. Someone else’s, but not theirs either. We plan as if every plan will come to fruition. We push them, support them, challenge them, heal them, soothe them, cuddle the hell out of them, as if we will see the results of this work. We might. We might not. We love like it’s always, in the most brazen, in-your-face, I-don’t-give-a-flying-fuck-about-the-future-and-how-it-will-crush-us-way.
We do. Because foster parents do. It’s the job.
They tell you this going in, of course, but you don’t get it until you realize it’s a one-way street, and there are no brakes on your go-cart, and you are barreling ahead 100 MPH. You are just in it, clutching the wheel and screaming your lungs out for dear fucking life, while the wind rips at your face. That’s the emotional side of foster parenting. All in. 100 MPH.
So this is how I explain us – maybe not to kids in pools, but to myself  – I’m the Mom. So is she. It’s complicated. Love is big enough to include all of us. The future is uncertain and scary and unknowable. And full of amazing possibilities. This is family. Crazy, messed up, weird family. But still family. And it’s all worth it.
These kids, all of my kids, are worth it.
Love – even love that comes from loss – is magic.
Normal
August 30, 2016
 
David just came back from Edinburgh. The kids and I had five days alone together.
Oy.
Let me just say that when you have a great partner, you do feel their absence. There is a space that goes unfilled, not just emotionally, like, “I miss you,” but in all the areas. At first, it seems fine they are gone. We eat easy dinners of frozen food. There are no dishes to be done. Yay! We stay up a little later. We read one more book at bedtime.
It’s fine, we all say to ourselves.
But then the new normal seeps in, and it isn’t as good. It doesn’t run as smoothly. There are cracks and fissures. We hate the frozen food, and we long for a roast chicken dinner. We are tired and need our old sleep rituals. We feel cranky and we don’t now why.
Then, by day four, its friggin’ clear that something is amiss, and the rhythms are off, and there is baby-wailing for no reason and boy-acting-out for no reason, and the voices are louder, and the confusion is greater, we are losing things and the older girls are having tantrums about it. The children need a lot more attention, but I’m just struggling to cook the damned chicken, and I can’t hold them all in my arms and love them all while I cut vegetables, and do dishes and pack lunches, and I need some time to myself, that would be nice, to have a complete uninterrupted thought, but we are in triage mode, so I’m not even thinking about that, that’s laying on a beach in the sun on a far off tropical island fantasy shit.
Okay, so maybe I’m not as patient as I usually am, because everyone is mad. Mad. Mad. Mad.
Just fucking mad.
I control the mood in the house, I know that. So, I change it up. I stop everything that is practical and efficient. I corral them there all there on the couch, and we lay around feet over feet, legs over legs, watching Sharknado for the 3rd time because it’s stupid and awesome and it makes everyone happy. We laugh. We scream. We hide our eyes when the sharks eat the bad guys in lots of tacky, bloody, glorious bits. I let the dishes curdle in the sink. I let the leftover food sit out on the kitchen counter.
This helps. Me giving them all my attention, but I grumble in my head about having to do the dishes at 10 o’clock tonight. Then, I let it go. I smile at them. I kiss their little heads. I rub their little feet. I make fun of Ian Ziering in my head.
And David is on a plane, oh yes he is, somewhere over Greenland, he tells me on International Wi-Fi. But he cannot get here soon enough. For all of us.
Finally he comes. And just stepping through the door, they all run to him, and grab him around the waist, the legs, and the baby toddles over and falls on his feet. It isn’t that second, but maybe an hour or two later – after the hugs and cuddles on the couch that happen before he has even taken off his jacket, that twilight time where they fill him in on everything, their voices and stories overlapping, and gifts, bought at the airport, get handed out and unwrapped – that the normal comes back.
There is dinner, and he and I debrief quickly in the kitchen between quick, the-children-are-watching kisses, and there are baths, and the readying for school, and the uniform that needs to have an emergency washing or else the universe will crack into millions of pieces and the girl-child will explode from embarrassment, and all the other completely essential routines of the night.
He takes a shower to wash off the plane. I make us a cocktail. We hold hands and binge-watch some show we are addicted to. He is jet-lagged, part of his body still lingering in Britain, but most of him is here.
Most of him is here.
And the normal seeps back in. Everything calms down.
I will be able to sleep tonight. First time I’ll get a sound sleep for four nights.
Normal.
We go back to the way we were, all together. I see our children breathe again, their anxiety quiets like shallow, unmoving puddles of water.
We are okay, put back together.
Back to normal.
Only
August 20, 2016
 
I’m trying to write this while Lucy is blaring Hamilton, making me listen to particularly genius lyrics and riffs, ones that speak to her so personally she must listen to them over and over, as I did when I was her age, with Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy, and Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and Honky Chateau, singing those lyrics over and over, like they were some kind of other-worldly manual for the life I wanted to have. I, with my ear to the big speaker. Her, with her ear to the phone.
Edie is clinging to my waist, she is bored so bored so bored, and now they are fighting, screaming at each other, but then again, they aren’t. Now they are talking in soft tones, talking about how they are going to punch each other, and puke on each other’s hair, and they laugh, so I know they are not serious, and they tell me they enjoy trash talking each other, the crueler the better…”You’re so ugly even Hello Kitty said ‘goodbye’ to you,” Edie says, and Lucy responds,  “I love your hair.  It’s just like Rapunzel’s….except she has fewer dreads.” They love twisting the words into something nefarious and still coming out of the loop fine and whole and together.  I wonder who I trashed talked as a kid?….No one, only children don’t trash talk the shadows on the walls.
Or did I? And did they respond back? Maybe, so much going on in my head back then, in my room, being the only one.
They are watching something on TV  now and they turn to tell me various things happening in the storyline. I don’t care about the details, but I love being in the room with them, hearing their chatter, their constant love – almost addiction for – each other’s attention, so much reaching out to each other, so much slapping and soothing, slapping and soothing, slapping and soothing.
Sisters.
At the same time, I want to flee this room, with them in it, and be alone in silence and quiet and my own thoughts, and words, my own shadows, dark and looming as they may be.
Burr is getting on my last wired nerve, playin’ over and friggin’  over. Edie, she plops down on top of me – a loving, longing hug that stops my freedom to move, and smothers me in her deep, limitless heart -and pins my right arm down, underneath her, and I cannot bang out another word.
The words simply stop.
They stop because I am surrounded by my people. I am not an only anymore. Nothing is just mine. Thank God my tolerance for aloneness has been loosened and un-cinched by their insistence.
I think.
They do not care that I write, as long as I write about them, as if my quiet time, any time I have, is still also theirs.
And Edie is reading this over my shoulder.
Spectacle
August 8, 2016
 
Last night we went to a birthday party.
It was one of those wonderful parties, thrown by a wonderful family, with swimming, and tea parties and a bedlam of kids, big and small, clamoring through the house, with their still wet feet and just out of floaties.
Exactly how you want to celebrate a two-year-olds birthday.
David was there for the first hour, and there weren’t many kids, so our foster son was pretty good in the pool. But then David went to a meeting, and throngs of kids came and the atmosphere turned happily chaotic and crazy. All in a good way, but for a kid who can’t navigate chaos, who thrives on structure, who loses his mind in a playroom full of guns and arrows, and toys that that can be crafted into guns and arrows, which is like every toy on earth, it was brain scrambling.
He ran away from me. He stomped his feet. He refused any and all requests. If I touched him, he shook me off. We were a parenting spectacle.
Normally, we have one parent on him and one on the baby, and both of us manage any issues with Lucy and Edie, even though there are rarely issues. So I was basically running through groups of kids, happily crawling, playing, running, holding the baby like a football and chasing a child who wanted none of my balls and chains.
I decided no yelling at him. I did not need to be the parent at the party who screamed at their kid. Also, a parenting spectacle.
I must’ve looked desperate because people jumped in to help. (Thank you, Village.) But help sometimes doesn’t help. Several people tried to get him to settle down and eat like the other kids. They got him food. They were sweet. But I knew he could never sit and eat at this party, we had plied him with grilled salmon (AKA pink chicken) and vegetables before the party so we didn’t have this argument.
Eating at the party was never going to happen.
An older woman was listening to us when I told him he didn’t have to eat his pulled pork sandwich. I know this sounded like submission, bad parenting, not staying strong, whatever you want to call it, but we cannot have stand-offs while children stampede around us, knocking back cupcakes and capri suns. It doesn’t work.
It is, again, a parenting spectacle I didn’t want to have.
But with everyone of these fails, we learn our limits. Like maybe we can’t take him to parties when the child to adult ratio is 4:1. Maybe we can come early, and leave early. Maybe he can go a little wild and be a little disobedient sometimes, as long as he doesn’t hurt himself or someone else. Maybe we celebrate on another day with the family, something more low key and manageable for him. Maybe next time, he will get it, and he’ll relax and be okay.
Maybe.
Maybe someday not every new thing will make him anxious and act out because he can’t control it.
Maybe someday he will have friends who he doesn’t push away.
Maybe he will be able to shake off all the foster homes, and the early neglect, and the changes, and the flimsy foundations built for him.
Maybe someday he will stop fighting everyone and everything.
Maybe he won’t blow everything up that’s good because he distrusts it.
Maybe he can relax, and know he’ll be just fine.
Maybe.
Someday.
