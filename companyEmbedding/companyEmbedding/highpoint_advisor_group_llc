Midyear Outlook 2017: A Shift In Market Control

Thus far in 2017, an important shift has taken place in this economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has shown increasing trust that the economy has recovered and that market forces can keep it steady. The gauges say growth engines and market drivers may have changed: power down monetary policy, power up business fundamentals, and potentially take fiscal policy and economic growth off standby.
Here are the key themes we’ll be watching as we look ahead to the rest of 2017:

Monetary policy: Slow path to normalization.
Maintaining economic growth without extraordinary central bank support will be key.
Business fundamentals: Now taking control.
A focus on well-run businesses with the potential for earnings gains may favor active management.
Economic growth: Confidence not enough, yet.
Business and consumer confidence has improved, but greater policy clarity may be needed to spur growth.
Fiscal policy: Pro-growth potential, but when?
Fiscal policy support remains likely, but timetable may be pushed back to 2018.

Financial Planning Tips in Your 40s: Make the Right Call

 

By highpointadvisors   July 18, 2017  No Comments 

While you can get away with financial mistakes made in your 20s and 30s, every single mistake made in the 40s will have a major impact on the rest of your life and beyond that.

It is therefore very important that you make the right decisions from the moment you hit forty. The following are five broad financial areas to focus on that will set the groundwork for a lifetime of financial security.
Pay cash for most things
The idea is to eliminate debt except for big investments such as your mortgage and car payments. The average American household has over $14,000 in credit card debt*. Since the average interest rate for credit card debt is 14%, this means we pay on average $2,000 per year in interests alone – a complete waste of money, right? The sooner you get out of this trap by paying in cash, the more money you’ll have to build you financial future.
Create multiple streams of income
Time flies and as soon as you hit 40, it’s usually only a few more years before you’re retiring. To ensure a financially secure retirement life, consider starting a series of systematic investments and invest as much as you can. You can start with a retirement account. But don’t stop there. A few other options you may want to consider include investing in stocks and mutual, buying Treasury Bills through Treasury Direct, and investing in other vehicles.
Ensure that your mortgage is paid off when you retire
For an even less stressful retirement life, you should make arrangements to have the mortgage cleared early. You don’t want to be paying $2,000 or more towards mortgage each month in retirement. It can be a big burden. Fortunately, there are a few options here too. You can sell the current home and downsize, you can move into your vacation property, or even plan your payments in such a way that you’ll have the mortgage paid off a few years before you retire.
Write a net worth statement each year
The simplest way to go about this is to keep an assets and liabilities statement. Just make it as detailed as possible and ensure to update it each year. Even if you work with a financial planner, the net worth statement should be reviewed at least once a year. This will help you immensely in the future as you’ll be able to focus on getting your assets to overtake your liabilities.
Run a retirement calculator annually
You are always advised to save towards retirement. In fact, you need to know how much you should be saving monthly depending on your current earnings and the kind of retirement life you wish to have. Failure to save appropriately can have very painful consequences. To find out if you’re saving appropriately, run a retirement calculator every year. There are several retirement saving calculators out there that you can use.

Top Attractions and Things to Do in Syracuse, NY

 

By highpointadvisors   June 30, 2017  No Comments 
Located in Onondaga County, New York, Syracuse is blessed with amazing sights and breathtaking tourist attractions. We look at some of the top free leisure spots within this beautiful city.

E.M. Mills Memorial Rose Garden
Located at the southwest corner of the Thornden Park is a beautiful rose garden known as the E.M. Mills. It’s a magnificent garden with more than 3,000 rose bushes which bloom in the summer and spring. The garden is maintained by volunteers from the Syracuse Rose Society and attracts dozens of artists and photographers on any given day. Thornden Park also includes a 50-meter outdoor pool, tennis courts, a multi-purpose athletic field, and a playground for kids.
Armory Square
The most popular area of downtown Syracuse, Armory Square is always full of locals and tourists alike who love to enjoy the outdoors. The place is lined with boutiques, coffee shops, restaurants, and many other attractions. At the corner of the Walton of Walton and Franklin Streets stands another famous attraction – the 24-second shot clock which is a tribute to Syracuse native Danny Biasone, the inventor of the game-changing pro-basketball innovation.
Onondaga Lake trails
If you feel like spending some time alone as you enjoy the pleasures of nature, there is more than nine miles of public trails along the shore of the Onondaga Lake – the West Shore Trail which meanders through over 4.5 miles of quiet woodland and open areas being the longest of them. While there, don’t forget to check out the recently added extension to the tail which offers spectacular lake and city views.
Community Folk Art Center
The Community Folk Art Center was founded in 1972 and showcases African Diaspora Artists. Among other things, you’ll enjoy thrilling exhibitions, gallery talks, film screenings, workshops, and courses in studio and performing arts. It’s located at 805 E. Genesee St. and open 10am to 5pm Tuesday to Friday and 11am to 5pm Saturdays.
Onondaga Public Library Main Branch
The Onondaga Library is as old as they come having been built by the City of Syracuse in 1905. However, an $8.7 million renovation is currently underway which will transform the library into a modern, 21st century resource. Once completed, the ground floor will feature a “maker space” where visitors can learn, create and build. There will also be a music recording studio, a 3-D printing machine, and many other tools.
Webster Pond
The Webster Pond is a 95-acre sanctuary in the Valley, off the Valley Drive. It’s open daily and provides an excellent place to unwind. But it’s not just that. The place is also home to the Anglers Association of Onondaga, a non-profit organization which offers a myriad of programs including fishing instructions for kids and adults. There are also plenty of wildlife to see including Canada geese, deer, mink, raccoons, woodchuck, turtles, herons, purple martens, and many others.

These are just a few examples. There are many other awesome attractions in Syracuse – Destiny USA, Clinton Square Festivals, The Central New York Regional Market, Salt Museum, the Erie Canal Museum – the list is endless....
                                            Continue ReadingRead More

With strategies that span multiple asset classes, HighPoint Planning Partners’ approach to equity and fixed income investing is driven by integrated research and risk management processes and seeks to achieve returns consistent with the given investment objective of the client. Our investment committee, dedicated analysts and experienced portfolio managers proactively look for opportunities to capitalize on market dynamics and seek to protect downside market exposure, depending upon the advisor-selected or advisor-managed model.
