Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel  , on 7/6/17, Darden Restaurants, Inc. (Symbol: DRI), Time Warner Inc (Symbol: TWX), and OGE Energy Corp. (Symbol: OGE) will all trade ex-dividend for their respective upcoming dividends. Darden Restaurants, Inc. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.63 on 8/1/17, Time Warner Inc will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.4025 on 8/1/17, and OGE Energy Corp. will pay its quarterly dividend of $0.3025 on 7/28/17. As a percentage of DRI's recent stock price of $90.90, this dividend works out to approximately 0.69%, so look for shares of Darden Restaurants, Inc. to trade 0.69% lower - all else being equal - when DRI shares open for trading on 7/6/17. Similarly, investors should look for TWX to open 0.40% lower in price and for OGE to open 0.87% lower, all else being equal.    Below are dividend history charts for DRI, TWX, and OGE, showing historical dividends prior to the most recent ones declared.   Darden Restaurants, Inc. (Symbol: DRI)  :       Time Warner Inc (Symbol: TWX)  :         OGE Energy Corp. (Symbol: OGE)  :          In general, dividends are not always predictable, following the ups and downs of company profits over time. Therefore, a good first due diligence step in forming an expectation of annual yield going forward, is looking at the history above, for a sense of stability over time. This can help in judging whether the most recent dividends from these companies are likely to continue. If they do continue, the current estimated yields on annualized basis would be 2.77% for Darden Restaurants, Inc., 1.59% for Time Warner Inc, and 3.49% for OGE Energy Corp..    In Wednesday trading, Darden Restaurants, Inc. shares are currently off about 0.5%, Time Warner Inc shares are down about 0.2%, and OGE Energy Corp. shares are down about 0.5% on the day.

SunPower Corporation (SPWR  -  Free Report)	, a subsidiary of Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report)	, recently signed a contract with Oklahoma Gas & Electric Company (OG&E), an electric utility subsidiary of OGE Energy Corp. (OGE  -  Free Report)	. Per the deal, SunPower will construct a 10-megawatt (MW) solar photovoltaic (PV) power plant in Covington, OK.Details of the PlantThe plant's construction will start from August, while its commercial operation is expected to commence in the beginning of 2018.SunPower Oasis Power Plant system, which will be designed and built by the company, is a total power plant solution that could be set up fast to maximize value for customers. The system includes 50% less parts compared with the usual solar plant systems. It also boasts an incorporated solar tracker design that simplifies construction, and decreases operations and maintenance costs.Additionally, the system is powered by cost-effective, high efficiency SunPower P-Series solar panels, generating more energy than conventional solar panels over the life span of the system.After being operational, operations and maintenance services will be provided by SunPower. Also, it is expected to generate sufficient electricity to meet the requirements of more than 1,000 average Oklahoma homes, per the approximations provided by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Notably, the renewable energy credits associated with the system will be owned by OG&E.SunPower's Order WinsIn June, SunPower was selected to supply 64 MW of its high efficiency SunPower E-Series solar panels for France’s rooftop solar projects. Again in May, SunPower initiated the construction of a 28 MW solar photovoltaic system at Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, CA.Earlier in March, the company was selected to supply 130 MW of its high efficiency SunPower E-Series solar panels for rooftop solar projects.Upcoming Solar Power ProjectsSunPower has a number of projects under construction including Boulder Solar II, a 62 MW AC solar power plant in the Eldorado Valley of Boulder City, NV, which is anticipated to be operational from this year. Sierra Pacific Power Company will be purchasing the power generated by the plant under a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA).Furthermore, the Iberdrola Gala Solar Project, with a capacity of 56 MW, is expected to be operational from the current year.The company has plans to build few solar projects in different regions in Mexico with expected delivery dates in 2018 and 2019. These projects are anticipated to generate gross margin above 20%.What Lies Ahead for the Solar Industry?With growing concerns regarding climatic changes, many countries across the globe are focusing on solar and wind generation. Therefore, solar power is expected to become one of the major energy sources in coming days. In fact, the U.S solar companies are already serving customers globally as the big economies are willing to explore the power of the sun.According to a U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the utility-scale solar power capacity will continue to grow by almost 44% from 21 GW at the end of 2016. Notably, the projected increase will bring the amount of solar capacity to 31 GW at 2018 end.In spite of the rapid uptick, solar will still constitute just 1% of the total U.S. utility-scale generation in 2018, thereby indicating immense scope for growth.Over the last few years, utility-scale solar has represented almost two thirds of the market, and this trend will likely continue in the near term, given the huge pipeline of projects under construction.In particular, 2016 was a record year for the U.S. solar industry. The PV market grew 97% from 2015’s individual installations of more than 3,70,000. Although all the market segments grew in 2016, the utility sector recorded maximum growth, which was more than doubled with installations totaling over 10 gigawatts (GW). Considering the aforementioned developments, similar upside in the solar industry can be expected for 2017 and beyond as well.Price MovementSunPower has outperformed the Zacks categorized Solar industry on a year-to-date basis. During this period, the company’s shares have gained 68.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 33%.We believe the company’s focus on expanding its services to the untapped global market has boosted its performance.Zacks Rank and Stock to ConsiderSunPower carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (SEDG  -  Free Report)	, sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.SolarEdge Technologies' 2017 Zacks Consensus Estimate moved up by approximately 4.5% to $1.16 per share in the last seven days. The company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 13.34% in the last four quarters.3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech TrendZacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy...Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early.

OKLAHOMA CITY, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OGE Energy Corp. (NYSE:   OGE), the parent company of Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company ("OG&E"), and holder of 25.7 percent limited partner interest and 50 percent general partner interest in Enable Midstream Partners, LP, today reported earnings of $0.18 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.13 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2016. 








OG&E, a regulated electric utility, contributed earnings of $0.08 per share in the first quarter, compared with earnings of $0.03 per share in the first quarter last year. OGE Energy's interest in the natural gas midstream operations contributed earnings of $0.10 per share compared with earnings of $0.09 per share in the year-ago quarter. The holding company posted breakeven results compared with earnings of $0.01 per share in 2016.
"Despite regulatory and weather challenges, the utility is on plan," said OGE Energy Corp. Chairman, President and CEO Sean Trauschke. "Each day, we're adjusting, adapting and moving forward. I could not be more proud of the focus and determination of our team to press forward and create value for those we serve." 
Discussion of First Quarter 2017
OGE Energy's net income was $36 million in the first quarter, compared to approximately $25 million in the year-ago quarter. 
OG&E's net income was approximately $16 million in the first quarter, compared to approximately $6 million in the comparable quarter last year. The primary driver for the increase in net income was the lower depreciation expense related to the reduction in depreciation rates as directed in the Oklahoma Corporation Commission's final order. These increases were partially offset by lower gross margin due in part to milder than normal weather.
Natural Gas Midstream Operations contributed net income to OGE Energy Corp. of $20 million for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $18 million for the same period in 2016. The increase is primarily due to increased gross margin and cost controlling measures in the gathering and processing business segment.  In addition, Enable Midstream issued cash distributions to OGE of approximately $35 million in each of the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.
2017 Earnings Outlook 
The Company projects 2017 OG&E earnings guidance to be at the low end of the earnings range of $1.58 to $1.70 per average diluted share based on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission rate order. OGE Energy consolidated earnings guidance for 2017 is now projected to be at the lower end of the earnings range of $1.93 to $2.09 per average diluted share. More information regarding the Company's 2017 earnings guidance is contained in the Company's 2016 Form 10-K and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Conference Call Webcast
OGE Energy will host a conference call for discussion of the results at 8 a.m. CST on Thursday, May 4. The conference will be available through www.oge.com. OGE Energy Corp. is the parent company of OG&E, a regulated electric utility with approximately 836,000 customers in Oklahoma and western Arkansas. In addition, OGE holds a 25.7 percent limited partner interest and a 50 percent general partner interest of Enable Midstream, created by the merger of OGE's Enogex LLC midstream subsidiary and the pipeline and field services businesses of Houston-based CenterPoint Energy.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
OG&E has included in this release the non-GAAP financial measure Gross Margin. Gross Margin is defined by OG&E as operating revenues less fuel, purchased power and certain transmission expenses.  Gross margin is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes depreciation and amortization, and other operation and maintenance expenses. Expenses for fuel and purchased power are recovered through fuel adjustment clauses and as a result changes in these expenses are offset in operating revenues with no impact on net income.  OG&E believes gross margin provides a more meaningful basis for evaluating its operations across periods than operating revenues because gross margin excludes the revenue effect of fluctuations in these expenses.  Gross margin is used internally to measure performance against budget and in reports for management and the Board of Directors. OG&E's definition of gross margin may be different from similar terms used by other companies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
