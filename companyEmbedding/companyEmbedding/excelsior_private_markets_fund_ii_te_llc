    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.

participate in the same investment
opportunities through a proposed coinvestment program where such
participation would otherwise be
prohibited under section 17 of the Act;
and (b) make additional investments in
securities of such issuers (‘‘Follow-On
Investments’’), including through the
exercise of warrants, conversion
privileges, and other rights to purchase
securities of the issuers. ‘‘Co-Investment
Transaction’’ means any transaction in
which a Regulated Entity (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary, as
defined below) participated together
with one or more other Regulated
Entities and/or Affiliated Funds in
reliance on the requested Order.
‘‘Potential Co-Investment Transaction’’
means any investment opportunity in
which a Regulated Entity (or its WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiaries) could
not participate together with one or
more other Regulated Entities and/or
one or more Affiliated Funds without
obtaining and relying on the Order.5
10. Applicants state that a Regulated
Entity may, from time to time, form one
or more Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiaries.6 Such a subsidiary would
be prohibited from investing in a CoInvestment Transaction with any other
Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund
because it would be a company
controlled by its parent Regulated Entity
for purposes of rule 17d-1. Applicants
request that each Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary be permitted to
participate in Co-Investment
Transactions in lieu of its parent
Regulated Entity and that the WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary’s
participation in any such transaction be
treated, for purposes of the Order, as
though the parent Regulated Entity were
and is advised by an Adviser. The term ‘‘Adviser’’
means any Existing NB Adviser or any Regulated
Entity Adviser. No Affiliated Fund is or will be a
subsidiary of a Regulated Entity.
5 All existing entities that currently intend to rely
upon the requested Order have been named as
applicants. Any other existing or future entity that
subsequently relies on the Order will comply with
the terms and conditions of the application.
6 The term ‘‘Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiary’’ means an entity: (a) That is whollyowned by a Regulated Entity (with such Regulated
Entity at all times holding, beneficially and of
record, 100% of the voting and economic interests);
(b) whose sole business purpose is to hold one or
more investments on behalf of such Regulated
Entity; (c) with respect to which the board of
directors of such Regulated Entity has the sole
authority to make all determinations with respect
to the entity’s participation under the conditions of
the application; and (d) that would be an
investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or
3(c)(7) of the Act. All subsidiaries participating in
Co-Investment Transactions will be Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiaries and will have Objectives
and Strategies (as defined below) that are either the
same as, or a subset of, their parent Regulated
Entity’s Objectives and Strategies.

Jkt 241001

participating directly. Applicants
represent that this treatment is justified
because a Wholly-Owned Investment
Subsidiary would have no purpose
other than serving as a holding vehicle
for the Regulated Entity’s investments
and, therefore, no conflicts of interest
could arise between the Regulated
Entity and the Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated
Entity’s Board would make all relevant
determinations under the conditions
with regard to a Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiary’s participation in
a Co-Investment Transaction, and the
Regulated Entity’s Board would be
informed of, and take into
consideration, any proposed use of a
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary
in the Regulated Entity’s place. If the
Regulated Entity proposes to participate
in the same Co-Investment Transaction
with any of its Wholly-Owned
Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will
also be informed of, and take into
consideration, the relative participation
of the Regulated Entity and the WhollyOwned Investment Subsidiary.
11. When considering Potential CoInvestment Transactions for any
Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser
will consider only the Objectives and
Strategies,7 investment policies,
investment positions, capital available
for investment, and other pertinent
factors applicable to that Regulated
Entity. The Advisers expect that any
portfolio company that is an appropriate
investment for a Regulated Entity
should also be an appropriate
investment for one or more other
Regulated Entities and/or one or more
Affiliated Funds, with certain
exceptions based on available capital or
diversification.8
12. Other than pro rata dispositions
and Follow-On Investments as provided
in conditions 7 and 8, and after making
the determinations required in
conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable
Adviser will present each Potential CoInvestment Transaction and the
proposed allocation to the directors of
the Board eligible to vote on that CoInvestment Transaction (the ‘‘Eligible
Directors’’) 9 and the majority of such
7 The term ‘‘Objectives and Strategies’’ means a
Regulated Entity’s investment objectives and
strategies as described in the Regulated Entity’s
registration statement on Form N–2, other filings
the Regulated Entity has made with the
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 (the
‘‘Securities Act’’) or the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and the Regulated Entity’s reports to
shareholders.
8 The Regulated Entities, however, will not be
obligated to invest, or co-invest, when investment
opportunities are referred to them.
9 Eligible Directors may not have a financial
interest in such transaction, plan, or arrangement.

managers of the Board who are
Independent Managers (a ‘‘Required
Majority’’) will approve each CoInvestment Transaction prior to any
investment by the participating
Regulated Entity.
13. With respect to the pro rata
dispositions and Follow-On Investments
provided in conditions 7 and 8, a
Regulated Entity may participate in a
pro rata disposition or Follow-On
Investment without obtaining prior
approval of the Required Majority if,
among other things: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Entity
and each Affiliated Fund in such
disposition is proportionate to its
outstanding investments in the issuer
immediately preceding the disposition
or Follow-On Investment, as the case
may be; and (ii) the Board of the
Regulated Entity has approved that
Regulated Entity’s participation in pro
rata dispositions and Follow-On
Investments as being in the best
interests of the Regulated Entity. If the
Board does not so approve, any such
disposition or Follow-On Investment
will be submitted to the Regulated
Entity’s Eligible Directors. The Board of
any Regulated Entity may at any time
rescind, suspend or qualify its approval
of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On
Investments with the result that all
dispositions and/or Follow-On
Investments must be submitted to the
Eligible Directors.
14. No Independent Manager of a
Regulated Entity will have a direct or
indirect financial interest in any CoInvestment Transaction (other than
indirectly through share ownership in
one of the Regulated Entities), including
any interest in any company whose
securities would be acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction.
15. Under condition 15, if an Adviser,
its principals, or any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control
with the Adviser or its principals, and
the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the
‘‘Holders’’) own in the aggregate more
than 25 percent of the outstanding
voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the
‘‘Shares’’), then the Holders will vote
such Shares as directed by an
independent third party when voting on
matters specified in the condition.
Applicants believe that this condition
will ensure that the Independent
Managers will act independently in
evaluating the co-investment program,
because the ability of an Adviser or its
principals to influence the Independent
Managers by a suggestion, explicit or
implied, that the Independent Managers
can be removed will be limited
significantly. Applicants represent that
the Independent Managers will evaluate

E:\FR\FM\14APN1.SGM

14APN1

18026

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 71 / Friday, April 14, 2017 / Notices

and approve any such independent
third party, taking into account its
qualifications, reputation for
independence, cost to the Regulated
Entity’s shareholders, and other factors
that they deem relevant.

Applicants’ Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule
17d–1 under the Act prohibit affiliated
persons of a registered investment
company from participating in joint
transactions with the company unless
the Commission has granted an order
permitting such transactions. In passing
upon applications under rule 17d–1, the
Commission considers whether the
company’s participation in the joint
transaction is consistent with the
provisions, policies, and purposes of the
Act and the extent to which such
participation is on a basis different from
or less advantageous than that of other
participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence
of the requested relief, the Regulated
Entities may be, in some circumstances,
limited in their ability to participate in
attractive and appropriate investment
opportunities. Applicants believe that
the proposed terms and conditions will
ensure that the Co-Investment
Transactions are consistent with the
protection of each Regulated Entity’s
shareholders and with the purposes
intended by the policies and provisions
of the Act. Applicants state that the
Regulated Entities’ participation in the
Co-Investment Transactions will be
consistent with the provisions, policies,
and purposes of the Act and on a basis
that is not different from or less
advantageous than that of other
participants.
Applicants’ Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will
be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a
Potential Co-Investment Transaction for
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund that falls within a Regulated
Entity’s then-current Objectives and
Strategies, the Regulated Entity’s
Adviser will make an independent
determination of the appropriateness of
the investment for the Regulated Entity
in light of the Regulated Entity’s thencurrent circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated
Entity’s participation in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction to be
appropriate for the Regulated Entity, the
Adviser will then determine an
appropriate level of investment for the
Regulated Entity.
(b) If the aggregate amount
recommended by the applicable Adviser
to be invested by the applicable

VerDate Sep<11>2014

16:21 Apr 13, 2017

Jkt 241001

Regulated Entity in the Potential CoInvestment Transaction together with
the amount proposed to be invested by
the other participating Regulated
Entities and Affiliated Funds,
collectively, in the same transaction,
exceeds the amount of the investment
opportunity, the investment opportunity
will be allocated among them pro rata
based on each participant’s capital
available for investment in the asset
class being allocated, up to the amount
proposed to be invested by each. The
applicable Adviser will provide the
Eligible Directors of each participating
Regulated Entity with information
concerning each participating party’s
available capital to assist the Eligible
Directors with their review of the
Regulated Entity’s investments for
compliance with these allocation
procedures.
(c) After making the determinations
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the
applicable Adviser will distribute
written information concerning the
Potential Co-Investment Transaction
(including the amount proposed to be
invested by each Regulated Entity and
each Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible
Directors of each participating
Regulated Entity for their consideration.
A Regulated Entity will co-invest with
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund only if, prior to the Regulated
Entity’s participation in the Potential
Co-Investment Transaction, a Required
Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential CoInvestment Transaction, including the
consideration to be paid, are reasonable
and fair to the Regulated Entity and its
investors and do not involve
overreaching in respect of the Regulated
Entity or its investors on the part of any
person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment
Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the Regulated
Entity’s investors; and
(B) the Regulated Entity’s then-current
Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other
Regulated Entities or any Affiliated
Funds would not disadvantage the
Regulated Entity, and participation by
the Regulated Entity would not be on a
basis different from or less advantageous
than that of any other Regulated Entities
or any Affiliated Funds; provided that,
if any other Regulated Entity or any
Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated
Entity itself, gains the right to nominate
a director for election to a portfolio
company’s board of directors or the
right to have a board observer or any
similar right to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company, such event shall not

PO 00000

Frm 00060

Fmt 4703

be interpreted to prohibit the Required
Majority from reaching the conclusions
required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have
the right to ratify the selection of such
director or board observer, if any; and
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to,
and does, provide periodic reports to
the Board of the Regulated Entity with
respect to the actions of such director or
the information received by such board
observer or obtained through the
exercise of any similar right to
participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company;
and
(C) any fees or other compensation
that any Regulated Entity or any
Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person
of any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated
Fund receives in connection with the
right of a Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund to nominate a director
or appoint a board observer or otherwise
to participate in the governance or
management of the portfolio company
will be shared proportionately among
the participating Affiliated Funds (who
may each, in turn, share its portion with
its affiliated persons) and the
participating Regulated Entities in
accordance with the amount of each
party’s investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the
Regulated Entity will not benefit any
Adviser, the other Regulated Entities,
the Affiliated Funds or any affiliated
person of any of them (other than the
parties to the Co-Investment
Transaction), except (A) to the extent
permitted by condition 13, (B) to the
extent permitted by section 17(e) of the
Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a
result of an interest in the securities
issued by one of the parties to the CoInvestment Transaction, or (D) in the
case of fees or other compensation
described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Entity has the right
to decline to participate in any Potential
Co-Investment Transaction or to invest
less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present
to the Board of each Regulated Entity,
on a quarterly basis, a record of all
investments in Potential Co-Investment
Transactions made by any of the other
Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds
during the preceding quarter that fell
within the Regulated Entity’s thencurrent Objectives and Strategies that
were not made available to the
Regulated Entity, and an explanation of
why the investment opportunities were
not offered to the Regulated Entity. All
information presented to the Board
pursuant to this condition will be kept
for the life of the Regulated Entity and
at least two years thereafter, and will be

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 71 / Friday, April 14, 2017 / Notices
subject to examination by the
Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments
made in accordance with condition 8,10
a Regulated Entity will not invest in
reliance on the Order in any issuer in
which another Regulated Entity,
Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person
of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated
Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Entity will not
participate in any Potential CoInvestment Transaction unless the
terms, conditions, price, class of
securities to be purchased, settlement
date, and registration rights will be the
same for each participating Regulated
Entity and Affiliated Fund. The grant to
another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated
Fund, but not the Regulated Entity, of
the right to nominate a director for
election to a portfolio company’s board
of directors, the right to have an
observer on the board of directors or
similar rights to participate in the
governance or management of the
portfolio company will not be
interpreted so as to violate this
condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B)
and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange
or otherwise dispose of an interest in a
security that was acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction, the applicable
Adviser will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed disposition
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
participation by each Regulated Entity
in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Entity will have
the right to participate in such
disposition on a proportionate basis, at
the same price and on the same terms
and conditions as those applicable to
the participating Regulated Entities and
Affiliated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Entity may participate
in such disposition without obtaining
prior approval of the Required Majority
if: (i) The proposed participation of each
Regulated Entity and each Affiliated
Fund in such disposition is
proportionate to its outstanding
investments in the issuer immediately
preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board
of the Regulated Entity has approved as
being in the best interests of the
Regulated Entity the ability to
participate in such dispositions on a pro
rata basis (as described in greater detail
10 This exception applies only to Follow-On
Investments by a Regulated Entity in issuers in
which that Regulated Entity already holds
investments.

in the application); and (iii) the Board
of the Regulated Entity is provided on
a quarterly basis with a list of all
dispositions made in accordance with
this condition. In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Entity’s participation to the Regulated
Entity’s Eligible Directors, and the
Regulated Entity will participate in such
disposition solely to the extent that a
Required Majority determines that it is
in the Regulated Entity’s best interests.
(d) Each Regulated Entity and each
Affiliated Fund will bear its own
expenses in connection with any such
disposition.
8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an
Affiliated Fund desires to make a
Follow-On Investment in a portfolio
company whose securities were
acquired in a Co-Investment
Transaction, the applicable Adviser
will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that
participated in the Co-Investment
Transaction of the proposed transaction
at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to
the proposed participation, including
the amount of the proposed Follow-On
Investment, by each Regulated Entity.
(b) A Regulated Entity may participate
in such Follow-On Investment without
obtaining prior approval of the Required
Majority if: (i) The proposed
participation of each Regulated Entity
and each Affiliated Fund in such
investment is proportionate to its
outstanding investments in the issuer
immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and (ii) the Board of the
Regulated Entity has approved as being
in the best interests of the Regulated
Entity the ability to participate in
Follow-On Investments on a pro rata
basis (as described in greater detail in
the application). In all other cases, the
Adviser will provide its written
recommendation as to the Regulated
Entity’s participation to the Eligible
Directors, and the Regulated Entity will
participate in such Follow-On
Investment solely to the extent that a
Required Majority determines that it is
in the Regulated Entity’s best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On
Investment:
(i) The amount of a Follow-On
Investment is not based on the
Regulated Entities’ and the Affiliated
Funds’ outstanding investments
immediately preceding the Follow-On
Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount
recommended by the Adviser to be
invested by each Regulated Entity in the
Follow-On Investment, together with
the amount proposed to be invested by

the participating Affiliated Funds in the
same transaction, exceeds the amount of
the opportunity; then the amount
invested by each such party will be
allocated among them pro rata based on
each party’s capital available for
investment in the asset class being
allocated, up to the amount proposed to
be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On
Investments as permitted by this
condition will be considered a CoInvestment Transaction for all purposes
and subject to the other conditions set
forth in the application.
9. The Independent Managers of each
Regulated Entity will be provided
quarterly for review all information
concerning Potential Co-Investment
Transactions and Co-Investment
Transactions, including investments
made by other Regulated Entities and
the Affiliated Funds that the Regulated
Entity considered but declined to
participate in, so that the Independent
Managers may determine whether all
investments made during the preceding
quarter, including those investments
which the Regulated Entity considered
but declined to participate in, comply
with the conditions of the Order. In
addition, the Independent Managers
will consider at least annually the
continued appropriateness for the
Regulated Entity of participating in new
and existing Co-Investment
Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Entity will
maintain the records required by section
57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the
Regulated Entities were a business
development company (as defined in
section 2(a)(48) of the Act) and each of
the investments permitted under these
conditions were approved by the
Required Majority under section 57(f) of
the Act.
11. No Independent Manager of a
Regulated Entity will also be a director,
general partner, managing member or
principal, or otherwise an ‘‘affiliated
person’’ (as defined in the Act) of an
Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated
with acquiring, holding or disposing of
any securities acquired in a CoInvestment Transaction (including,
without limitation, the expenses of the
distribution of any such securities
registered for sale under the Securities
Act) will, to the extent not payable by
an Adviser under the investment
advisory agreements with the Regulated
Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be
shared by the Affiliated Funds and the
Regulated Entities in proportion to the
relative amounts of the securities held
or to be acquired or disposed of, as the
case may be.

13. Any transaction fee 11 (including
break-up or commitment fees but
excluding broker’s fees contemplated by
section 17(e) of the Act, as applicable),
received in connection with a CoInvestment Transaction will be
distributed to the participating
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds
on a pro rata basis based on the amounts
they invested or committed, as the case
may be, in such Co-Investment
Transaction. If any transaction fee is to
be held by the Adviser pending
consummation of the transaction, the
fee will be deposited into an account
maintained by the Adviser at a bank or
banks having the qualifications
prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act,
and the account will earn a competitive
rate of interest that will also be divided
pro rata among the participating
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds
based on the amounts they invest in
such Co-Investment Transaction. None
of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers,
the other Regulated Entities or any
affiliated person of the Regulated
Entities or Affiliated Funds will receive
additional compensation or
remuneration of any kind as a result of
or in connection with a Co-Investment
Transaction (other than (a) in the case
of the Regulated Entities and the
Affiliated Funds, the pro rata
transaction fees described above and
fees or other compensation described in
condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case
of the Advisers, investment advisory
fees paid in accordance with the
agreements between the Advisers and
the Regulated Entities or the Affiliated
Funds).
14. The Advisers will each maintain
policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure compliance with the
foregoing conditions. These policies and
procedures will require, among other
things, that the applicable Regulated
Entity Adviser will be notified of all
Potential Co-Investment Transactions
that fall within a Regulated Entity’s
then-current Objectives and Strategies
and will be given sufficient information
to make its independent determination
and recommendations under conditions
1, 2(a), 7 and 8.
15. If the Holders own in the aggregate
more than 25 percent of the Shares of
a Regulated Entity, then the Holders
will vote such Shares as directed by an
independent third party when voting on
(1) the election of directors; (2) the
removal of one or more directors; or (3)
all other matters under either the Act or
11 Applicants are not requesting and the staff is
not providing any relief for transaction fees
received in connection with any Co-Investment
Transaction.

compliance officer, as defined in Rule
38a–1(a)(4) under the 1940 Act, will
prepare an annual report for its Board
each year that evaluates (and documents
the basis of that evaluation) the
Regulated Entity’s compliance with the
terms and conditions of the application
and the procedures established to
achieve such compliance.

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Miami
International Securities Exchange,
LLC; Notice of Filing and Immediate
Effectiveness of a Proposed Rule
Change To Amend Its Fee Schedule
April 10, 2017.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section
19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (‘‘Act’’) 1 and Rule 19b–4
thereunder,2 notice is hereby given that
on April 6, 2017, Miami International
Securities Exchange LLC (‘‘MIAX
Options’’ or ‘‘Exchange’’) filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission
(‘‘Commission’’) a proposed rule change
as described in Items I, II, and III below,
which Items have been substantially
prepared by the Exchange. The
Commission is publishing this notice to
solicit comments on the proposed rule
change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Terms of Substance of
the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange is filing a proposal to
amend the MIAX Options Fee Schedule
(the ‘‘Fee Schedule’’).
The Exchange initially filed the
proposal on March 29, 2017 (SR–MIAX–
2017–14). That filing was withdrawn
and replaced with the current filing
(SR–MIAX–2017–15).
The text of the proposed rule change
is available on the Exchange’s Web site
at http://www.miaxoptions.com/rulefilings, at MIAX’s principal office, and

at the Commission’s Public Reference
Room.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
In its filing with the Commission, the
Exchange included statements
concerning the purpose of and basis for
the proposed rule change and discussed
any comments it received on the
proposed rule change. The text of these
statements may be examined at the
places specified in Item IV below. The
Exchange has prepared summaries, set
forth in sections A, B, and C below, of
the most significant aspects of such
statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement of the Purpose of, and the
Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule
Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to amend its
Fee Schedule to permit Exchange
Market Makers 3 to appoint Electronic
Exchange Members 4 (‘‘EEMs’’), and vice
versa, as ‘‘Affiliates,’’ solely for
purposes of calculating transaction
volume in order to qualify for certain
transaction rebates and fee incentives
under the Fee Schedule. The Exchange
notes that this concept of appointment
between market makers and order flow
providers currently exists at a number of
other exchanges, including Bats BZX
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘BATS’’), Bats EDGX
Exchange, Inc. (‘‘EDGX’’), Chicago
Board Options Exchange, Incorporated
(‘‘CBOE’’), NYSE Amex Options LLC
(‘‘Amex Options’’), and NASDAQ PHLX
LLC (‘‘PHLX’’), as more fully discussed
below.
In order for the Exchange to
implement this concept of appointment,
the Exchange proposes to amend the
definition of ‘‘Affiliate’’ contained in
Section (1)(a)(i), footnote 1, of the Fee
Schedule. Footnote 1 currently reads:
‘‘For purposes of the MIAX Options Fee
Schedule, the term ‘‘Affiliate’’ means an
affiliate of a Member of at least 75% common
ownership between the firms as reflected on
each firm’s Form BD, Schedule A
(‘‘Affiliate’’).’’
3 The term ‘‘Market Makers’’ refers to Lead Market
Makers (‘‘LMMs’’), Primary Lead Market Makers
(‘‘PLMMs’’), and Registered Market Makers
(‘‘RMMs’’) collectively. See Exchange Rule 100. A
Directed Order Lead Market Maker (‘‘DLMM’’) and
Directed Primary Lead Market Maker (‘‘DPLMM’’) is
a party to a transaction being allocated to the LMM
or PLMM and is the result of an order that has been
directed to the LMM or PLMM. See Footnote 2 to
the Fee Schedule.
4 The term ‘‘EEM’’ refers to the holder of a
Trading Permit who is not a Market Maker. See
Exchange Rule 100.

Applicants' Representations

    1. NB Crossroads is a Delaware limited liability corporation 
organized as a closed-end management investment company. NB 
Crossroads's investment objective is to provide attractive risk-
adjusted returns through diversified portfolio of professionally 
managed private equity funds and select direct investments in portfolio 
companies. The board of managers (``Board'') of NB Crossroads has six 
members, each of whom is not an ``interested person'' of NB Crossroads 
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the Act (each is an 
``Independent Manager'').\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The term ``Independent Manager'' refers to the independent 
managers, directors or trustees of any Regulated Entity (defined 
below).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    2. Excelsior Private Markets II is a Delaware limited liability 
company organized as a closed-end management investment company. 
Excelsior Private Markets II seeks to provide attractive long-term 
returns to investors through investments in a diversified portfolio of 
professionally managed private equity funds and select direct 
investments in portfolio companies. The Board of Excelsior Private 
Markets II has six members, each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    3. Excelsior Private Markets III is a Delaware limited liability 
company organized as a closed-end management investment company. 
Excelsior Private Markets III seeks to provide attractive long-term 
returns to investors through investments in a diversified portfolio of

investments in portfolio companies. The Board of Excelsior Private 
Markets III has six members, each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    4. UST Global is a Delaware limited liability company organized as 
a closed-end management v company. UST Global seeks long-term capital 
appreciation by investing in a diversified group of private equity 
funds formed by a fund sponsor or sponsors experienced in making 
private equity investments. The Board of UST Global has six members, 
each of whom is an Independent Manager.
    5. Excelsior Venture III is a Delaware limited liability company

a lesser extent, domestic and international private funds, negotiated 
private investments in public companies and international direct 
investments. The Board of Excelsior Venture III has three members, each 
of whom is an Independent Manager.
    6. NBIA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered 
as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Investment 
Advisers Act of 1940 (the ``Advisers Act''). NBIA serves as the 
investment adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBIA is an 
indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman Group LLC 
(``Neuberger Berman'').
    7. NBAA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered 
as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Advisers Act. 
NBAA serves as the investment adviser to certain Existing Affiliated 
Funds and as the sub-adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBAA is 
an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman.
    8. The Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on 
investing in a portfolio of professionally managed private equity funds 
and select direct investments in portfolio companies. Each Existing 
Affiliated Fund is advised by an Existing NB Adviser \2\ and would be 
an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ ``Existing NB Adviser'' means NBIA or NBAA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    9. Applicants seek an order (``Order'') to permit a Regulated 
Entity \3\ and one or more other Regulated Entities and one or more 
Affiliated Funds \4\ to (a)

[[Page 18025]]

participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-
investment program where such participation would otherwise be 
prohibited under section 17 of the Act; and (b) make additional 
investments in securities of such issuers (``Follow-On Investments''), 
including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and 
other rights to purchase securities of the issuers. ``Co-Investment 
Transaction'' means any transaction in which a Regulated Entity (or its 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) participated 
together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or Affiliated 
Funds in reliance on the requested Order. ``Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction'' means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated 
Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries) could not 
participate together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or 
one or more Affiliated Funds without obtaining and relying on the 
Order.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ ``Regulated Entity'' refers to any Existing Regulated Entity 
and any Future Regulated Entity. ``Future Regulated Entity'' means 
any closed-end management investment company formed in the future 
that is registered under the Act and is advised by a Regulated 
Entity Adviser and sub-advised by NBAA. ``Regulated Entity Adviser'' 
means (a) NBIA and (b) any future investment adviser that controls, 
is controlled by, or is under common control with NBIA and is 
registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.
    \4\ ``Affiliated Fund'' means any Existing Affiliated Fund or 
any Future Affiliated Fund. ``Future Affiliated Fund'' means any 
investment fund that would be an ``investment company'' but for 
section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act, is formed in the future, and 
is advised by an Adviser. The term ``Adviser'' means any Existing NB 
Adviser or any Regulated Entity Adviser. No Affiliated Fund is or 
will be a subsidiary of a Regulated Entity.
    \5\ All existing entities that currently intend to rely upon the 
requested Order have been named as applicants. Any other existing or 
future entity that subsequently relies on the Order will comply with 
the terms and conditions of the application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    10. Applicants state that a Regulated Entity may, from time to 
time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries.\6\ Such a 
subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment 
Transaction with any other Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund because 
it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Entity for 
purposes of rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned 
Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment 
Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Entity and that the 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such 
transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent 
Regulated Entity were participating directly. Applicants represent that 
this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment 
Subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding 
vehicle for the Regulated Entity's investments and, therefore, no 
conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Entity and the 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated Entity's Board would 
make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in a Co-Investment 
Transaction, and the Regulated Entity's Board would be informed of, and 
take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment 
Subsidiary in the Regulated Entity's place. If the Regulated Entity 
proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any 
of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will also be 
informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of 
the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ The term ``Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary'' means an 
entity: (a) That is wholly-owned by a Regulated Entity (with such 
Regulated Entity at all times holding, beneficially and of record, 
100% of the voting and economic interests); (b) whose sole business 
purpose is to hold one or more investments on behalf of such 
Regulated Entity; (c) with respect to which the board of directors 
of such Regulated Entity has the sole authority to make all 
determinations with respect to the entity's participation under the 
conditions of the application; and (d) that would be an investment 
company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act. All 
subsidiaries participating in Co-Investment Transactions will be 
Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries and will have Objectives and 
Strategies (as defined below) that are either the same as, or a 
subset of, their parent Regulated Entity's Objectives and 
Strategies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    11. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any 
Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser will consider only the 
Objectives and Strategies,\7\ investment policies, investment 
positions, capital available for investment, and other pertinent 
factors applicable to that Regulated Entity. The Advisers expect that 
any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated 
Entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other 
Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain 
exceptions based on available capital or diversification.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ The term ``Objectives and Strategies'' means a Regulated 
Entity's investment objectives and strategies as described in the 
Regulated Entity's registration statement on Form N-2, other filings 
the Regulated Entity has made with the Commission under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') or the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, and the Regulated Entity's reports to 
shareholders.
    \8\ The Regulated Entities, however, will not be obligated to 
invest, or co-invest, when investment opportunities are referred to 
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    12. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations 
required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will present 
each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to 
the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that Co-Investment 
Transaction (the ``Eligible Directors'') \9\ and the majority of such 
managers of the Board who are Independent Managers (a ``Required 
Majority'') will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any 
investment by the participating Regulated Entity.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ Eligible Directors may not have a financial interest in such 
transaction, plan, or arrangement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    13. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On 
Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Entity may 
participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other 
things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and 
each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its 
outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the 
disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the 
Board of the Regulated Entity has approved that Regulated Entity's 
participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as 
being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity. If the Board does 
not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be 
submitted to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors. The Board of 
any Regulated Entity may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its 
approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the 
result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be 
submitted to the Eligible Directors.
    14. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will have a direct 
or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction (other 
than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated 
Entities), including any interest in any company whose securities would 
be acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction.
    15. Under condition 15, if an Adviser, its principals, or any 
person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the 
Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the 
``Holders'') own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the 
outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the ``Shares''), then 
the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third 
party when voting on matters specified in the condition. Applicants 
believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Managers 
will act independently in evaluating the co-investment program, because 
the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the 
Independent Managers by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the 
Independent Managers can be removed will be limited significantly. 
Applicants represent that the Independent Managers will evaluate

[[Page 18026]]

and approve any such independent third party, taking into account its 
qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the Regulated 
Entity's shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.

Applicants' Legal Analysis

    1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit 
affiliated persons of a registered investment company from 
participating in joint transactions with the company unless the 
Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In 
passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers 
whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is 
consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and 
the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or 
less advantageous than that of other participants.
    3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, 
the Regulated Entities may be, in some circumstances, limited in their 
ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment 
opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and 
conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are 
consistent with the protection of each Regulated Entity's shareholders 
and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the 
Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Entities' participation in the 
Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, 
policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different 
from or less advantageous than that of other participants.

Applicants' Conditions

    Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following 
conditions:
    1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment 
Transaction for another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund that 
falls within a Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and 
Strategies, the Regulated Entity's Adviser will make an independent 
determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the 
Regulated Entity in light of the Regulated Entity's then-current 
circumstances.
    2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Entity's participation in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the 
Regulated Entity, the Adviser will then determine an appropriate level 
of investment for the Regulated Entity.
    (b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser 
to be invested by the applicable Regulated Entity in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested 
by the other participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds, 
collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the 
investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated 
among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for 
investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount 
proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide 
the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity with 
information concerning each participating party's available capital to 
assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated 
Entity's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
    (c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 
2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information 
concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the 
amount proposed to be invested by each Regulated Entity and each 
Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating 
Regulated Entity for their consideration. A Regulated Entity will co-
invest with another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund only if, 
prior to the Regulated Entity's participation in the Potential Co-
Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
    (i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including 
the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated 
Entity and its investors and do not involve overreaching in respect of 
the Regulated Entity or its investors on the part of any person 
concerned;
    (ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
    (A) The interests of the Regulated Entity's investors; and
    (B) the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
    (iii) the investment by any other Regulated Entities or any 
Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Entity, and 
participation by the Regulated Entity would not be on a basis different 
from or less advantageous than that of any other Regulated Entities or 
any Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Entity or 
any Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity itself, gains the 
right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's 
board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar 
right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio 
company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required 
Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition 
(2)(c)(iii), if:
    (A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the 
selection of such director or board observer, if any; and
    (B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic 
reports to the Board of the Regulated Entity with respect to the 
actions of such director or the information received by such board 
observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to 
participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; 
and
    (C) any fees or other compensation that any Regulated Entity or any 
Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any Regulated Entity or any 
Affiliated Fund receives in connection with the right of a Regulated 
Entity or an Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board 
observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of 
the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the 
participating Affiliated Funds (who may each, in turn, share its 
portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated 
Entities in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
    (iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Entity will not 
benefit any Adviser, the other Regulated Entities, the Affiliated Funds 
or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the 
Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by 
condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) of the Act, 
as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the 
securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment 
Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described 
in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
    3. Each Regulated Entity has the right to decline to participate in 
any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the 
amount proposed.
    4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each 
Regulated Entity, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated 
Entities or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell 
within the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies 
that were not made available to the Regulated Entity, and an 
explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the 
Regulated Entity. All information presented to the Board pursuant to 
this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Entity and at 
least two years thereafter, and will be

[[Page 18027]]

subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
    5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with 
condition 8,\10\ a Regulated Entity will not invest in reliance on the 
Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Entity, Affiliated Fund, 
or any affiliated person of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund 
is an existing investor.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ This exception applies only to Follow-On Investments by a 
Regulated Entity in issuers in which that Regulated Entity already 
holds investments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    6. A Regulated Entity will not participate in any Potential Co-
Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of 
securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights 
will be the same for each participating Regulated Entity and Affiliated 
Fund. The grant to another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund, but 
not the Regulated Entity, of the right to nominate a director for 
election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have 
an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate 
in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be 
interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 
2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
    7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund elects to 
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that 
was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser 
will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each 
Regulated Entity in the disposition.
    (b) Each Regulated Entity will have the right to participate in 
such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the 
same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating 
Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds.
    (c) A Regulated Entity may participate in such disposition without 
obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed 
participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such 
disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the 
issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the 
Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the 
Regulated Entity the ability to participate in such dispositions on a 
pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and 
(iii) the Board of the Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly 
basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this 
condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written 
recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the 
Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will 
participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required 
Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best 
interests.
    (d) Each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund will bear its 
own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
    8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund desires to make 
a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were 
acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
    (i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-
Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest 
practical time; and
    (ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, 
including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each 
Regulated Entity.
    (b) A Regulated Entity may participate in such Follow-On Investment 
without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The 
proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated 
Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments 
in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) 
the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best 
interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in Follow-
On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in 
the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its 
written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to 
the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in 
such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority 
determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.
    (c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
    (i) The amount of a Follow-On Investment is not based on the 
Regulated Entities' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments 
immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
    (ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested 
by each Regulated Entity in the Follow-On Investment, together with the 
amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in 
the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the 
amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro 
rata based on each party's capital available for investment in the 
asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested 
by each.
    (d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this 
condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all 
purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the 
application.
    9. The Independent Managers of each Regulated Entity will be 
provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-
Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including 
investments made by other Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds 
that the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, so 
that the Independent Managers may determine whether all investments 
made during the preceding quarter, including those investments which 
the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, comply 
with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Managers 
will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the 
Regulated Entity of participating in new and existing Co-Investment 
Transactions.
    10. Each Regulated Entity will maintain the records required by 
section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Entities were a 
business development company (as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the 
Act) and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were 
approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
    11. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will also be a 
director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise 
an ``affiliated person'' (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
    12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or 
disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction 
(including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any 
such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to 
the extent not payable by an Adviser under the investment advisory 
agreements with the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be 
shared by the Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Entities in proportion 
to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or 
disposed of, as the case may be.

[[Page 18028]]

    13. Any transaction fee \11\ (including break-up or commitment fees 
but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) of the Act, 
as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction 
will be distributed to the participating Regulated Entities and 
Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested 
or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If 
any transaction fee is to be held by the Adviser pending consummation 
of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account 
maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications 
prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a 
competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among 
the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds based on the 
amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the 
Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Entities or any 
affiliated person of the Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds will 
receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result 
of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in 
the case of the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, the pro 
rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation 
described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of the 
Advisers, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the 
agreements between the Advisers and the Regulated Entities or the 
Affiliated Funds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Applicants are not requesting and the staff is not 
providing any relief for transaction fees received in connection 
with any Co-Investment Transaction.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    14. The Advisers will each maintain policies and procedures 
reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the foregoing conditions. 
These policies and procedures will require, among other things, that 
the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will be notified of all 
Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within a Regulated 
Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies and will be given 
sufficient information to make its independent determination and 
recommendations under conditions 1, 2(a), 7 and 8.
    15. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the 
Shares of a Regulated Entity, then the Holders will vote such Shares as 
directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election 
of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) all 
other matters under either the Act or applicable State law affecting 
the Board's composition, size or manner of election.
    16. Each Regulated Entity's chief compliance officer, as defined in 
Rule 38a-1(a)(4) under the 1940 Act, will prepare an annual report for 
its Board each year that evaluates (and documents the basis of that 
evaluation) the Regulated Entity's compliance with the terms and 
conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve 
such compliance.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

6. NBIA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”). NBIA serves as the investment adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBIA is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman Group LLC (“Neuberger Berman”).
7. NBAA is a Delaware limited liability company that is registered as an investment adviser with the Commission under the Advisers Act. NBAA serves as the investment adviser to certain Existing Affiliated Funds and as the sub-adviser to each Existing Regulated Entity. NBAA is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Neuberger Berman.
8. The Existing Affiliated Funds pursue strategies focused on investing in a portfolio of professionally managed private equity funds and select direct investments in portfolio companies. Each Existing Affiliated Fund is advised by an Existing NB Adviser [2] 
           and would be an investment company but for section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Act.
9. Applicants seek an order (“Order”) to permit a Regulated Entity [3] 
           and one or more other Regulated Entities and one or more Affiliated Funds [4] 
           to (a) Start Printed Page 18025participate in the same investment opportunities through a proposed co-investment program where such participation would otherwise be prohibited under section 17 of the Act; and (b) make additional investments in securities of such issuers (“Follow-On Investments”), including through the exercise of warrants, conversion privileges, and other rights to purchase securities of the issuers. “Co-Investment Transaction” means any transaction in which a Regulated Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary, as defined below) participated together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or Affiliated Funds in reliance on the requested Order. “Potential Co-Investment Transaction” means any investment opportunity in which a Regulated Entity (or its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries) could not participate together with one or more other Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds without obtaining and relying on the Order.[5] 

10. Applicants state that a Regulated Entity may, from time to time, form one or more Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries.[6] 
           Such a subsidiary would be prohibited from investing in a Co-Investment Transaction with any other Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund because it would be a company controlled by its parent Regulated Entity for purposes of rule 17d-1. Applicants request that each Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary be permitted to participate in Co-Investment Transactions in lieu of its parent Regulated Entity and that the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in any such transaction be treated, for purposes of the Order, as though the parent Regulated Entity were participating directly. Applicants represent that this treatment is justified because a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary would have no purpose other than serving as a holding vehicle for the Regulated Entity's investments and, therefore, no conflicts of interest could arise between the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary. The Regulated Entity's Board would make all relevant determinations under the conditions with regard to a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary's participation in a Co-Investment Transaction, and the Regulated Entity's Board would be informed of, and take into consideration, any proposed use of a Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary in the Regulated Entity's place. If the Regulated Entity proposes to participate in the same Co-Investment Transaction with any of its Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiaries, the Board will also be informed of, and take into consideration, the relative participation of the Regulated Entity and the Wholly-Owned Investment Subsidiary.
11. When considering Potential Co-Investment Transactions for any Regulated Entity, the relevant Adviser will consider only the Objectives and Strategies,[7] 
           investment policies, investment positions, capital available for investment, and other pertinent factors applicable to that Regulated Entity. The Advisers expect that any portfolio company that is an appropriate investment for a Regulated Entity should also be an appropriate investment for one or more other Regulated Entities and/or one or more Affiliated Funds, with certain exceptions based on available capital or diversification.[8] 

12. Other than pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as provided in conditions 7 and 8, and after making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will present each Potential Co-Investment Transaction and the proposed allocation to the directors of the Board eligible to vote on that Co-Investment Transaction (the “Eligible Directors”) [9] 
           and the majority of such managers of the Board who are Independent Managers (a “Required Majority”) will approve each Co-Investment Transaction prior to any investment by the participating Regulated Entity.
13. With respect to the pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments provided in conditions 7 and 8, a Regulated Entity may participate in a pro rata disposition or Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if, among other things: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition or Follow-On Investment, as the case may be; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved that Regulated Entity's participation in pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity. If the Board does not so approve, any such disposition or Follow-On Investment will be submitted to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors. The Board of any Regulated Entity may at any time rescind, suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata dispositions and Follow-On Investments with the result that all dispositions and/or Follow-On Investments must be submitted to the Eligible Directors.
14. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will have a direct or indirect financial interest in any Co-Investment Transaction (other than indirectly through share ownership in one of the Regulated Entities), including any interest in any company whose securities would be acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction.
15. Under condition 15, if an Adviser, its principals, or any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the Adviser or its principals, and the Affiliated Funds (collectively, the “Holders”) own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the outstanding voting shares of a Regulated Entity (the “Shares”), then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on matters specified in the condition. Applicants believe that this condition will ensure that the Independent Managers will act independently in evaluating the co-investment program, because the ability of an Adviser or its principals to influence the Independent Managers by a suggestion, explicit or implied, that the Independent Managers can be removed will be limited significantly. Applicants represent that the Independent Managers will evaluate Start Printed Page 18026and approve any such independent third party, taking into account its qualifications, reputation for independence, cost to the Regulated Entity's shareholders, and other factors that they deem relevant.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 17(d) of the Act and rule 17d-1 under the Act prohibit affiliated persons of a registered investment company from participating in joint transactions with the company unless the Commission has granted an order permitting such transactions. In passing upon applications under rule 17d-1, the Commission considers whether the company's participation in the joint transaction is consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
3. Applicants state that in the absence of the requested relief, the Regulated Entities may be, in some circumstances, limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities. Applicants believe that the proposed terms and conditions will ensure that the Co-Investment Transactions are consistent with the protection of each Regulated Entity's shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the Act. Applicants state that the Regulated Entities' participation in the Co-Investment Transactions will be consistent with the provisions, policies, and purposes of the Act and on a basis that is not different from or less advantageous than that of other participants.
Applicants' Conditions
Applicants agree that the Order will be subject to the following conditions:
1. Each time an Adviser considers a Potential Co-Investment Transaction for another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund that falls within a Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies, the Regulated Entity's Adviser will make an independent determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the Regulated Entity in light of the Regulated Entity's then-current circumstances.
2. (a) If the Adviser deems a Regulated Entity's participation in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction to be appropriate for the Regulated Entity, the Adviser will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the Regulated Entity.
(b) If the aggregate amount recommended by the applicable Adviser to be invested by the applicable Regulated Entity in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction together with the amount proposed to be invested by the other participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds, collectively, in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity, the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on each participant's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each. The applicable Adviser will provide the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity with information concerning each participating party's available capital to assist the Eligible Directors with their review of the Regulated Entity's investments for compliance with these allocation procedures.
(c) After making the determinations required in conditions 1 and 2(a), the applicable Adviser will distribute written information concerning the Potential Co-Investment Transaction (including the amount proposed to be invested by each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund) to the Eligible Directors of each participating Regulated Entity for their consideration. A Regulated Entity will co-invest with another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund only if, prior to the Regulated Entity's participation in the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, a Required Majority concludes that:
(i) The terms of the Potential Co-Investment Transaction, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to the Regulated Entity and its investors and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Regulated Entity or its investors on the part of any person concerned;
(ii) the Potential Co-Investment Transaction is consistent with:
(A) The interests of the Regulated Entity's investors; and
(B) the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies;
(iii) the investment by any other Regulated Entities or any Affiliated Funds would not disadvantage the Regulated Entity, and participation by the Regulated Entity would not be on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of any other Regulated Entities or any Affiliated Funds; provided that, if any other Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity itself, gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors or the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company, such event shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Required Majority from reaching the conclusions required by this condition (2)(c)(iii), if:
(A) The Eligible Directors will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer, if any; and
(B) the applicable Adviser agrees to, and does, provide periodic reports to the Board of the Regulated Entity with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company; and
(C) any fees or other compensation that any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund or any affiliated person of any Regulated Entity or any Affiliated Fund receives in connection with the right of a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will be shared proportionately among the participating Affiliated Funds (who may each, in turn, share its portion with its affiliated persons) and the participating Regulated Entities in accordance with the amount of each party's investment; and
(iv) the proposed investment by the Regulated Entity will not benefit any Adviser, the other Regulated Entities, the Affiliated Funds or any affiliated person of any of them (other than the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction), except (A) to the extent permitted by condition 13, (B) to the extent permitted by section 17(e) of the Act, as applicable, (C) indirectly, as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the Co-Investment Transaction, or (D) in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C).
3. Each Regulated Entity has the right to decline to participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed.
4. The applicable Adviser will present to the Board of each Regulated Entity, on a quarterly basis, a record of all investments in Potential Co-Investment Transactions made by any of the other Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds during the preceding quarter that fell within the Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies that were not made available to the Regulated Entity, and an explanation of why the investment opportunities were not offered to the Regulated Entity. All information presented to the Board pursuant to this condition will be kept for the life of the Regulated Entity and at least two years thereafter, and will be Start Printed Page 18027subject to examination by the Commission and its staff.
5. Except for Follow-On Investments made in accordance with condition 8,[10] 
           a Regulated Entity will not invest in reliance on the Order in any issuer in which another Regulated Entity, Affiliated Fund, or any affiliated person of another Regulated Entity or Affiliated Fund is an existing investor.
6. A Regulated Entity will not participate in any Potential Co-Investment Transaction unless the terms, conditions, price, class of securities to be purchased, settlement date, and registration rights will be the same for each participating Regulated Entity and Affiliated Fund. The grant to another Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund, but not the Regulated Entity, of the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio company's board of directors, the right to have an observer on the board of directors or similar rights to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company will not be interpreted so as to violate this condition 6, if conditions 2(c)(iii)(A), (B) and (C) are met.
7. (a) If any Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund elects to sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of an interest in a security that was acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed disposition at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to participation by each Regulated Entity in the disposition.
(b) Each Regulated Entity will have the right to participate in such disposition on a proportionate basis, at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as those applicable to the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds.
(c) A Regulated Entity may participate in such disposition without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such disposition is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the disposition; (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in such dispositions on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application); and (iii) the Board of the Regulated Entity is provided on a quarterly basis with a list of all dispositions made in accordance with this condition. In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the Regulated Entity's Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in such disposition solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.
(d) Each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund will bear its own expenses in connection with any such disposition.
8. (a) If a Regulated Entity or an Affiliated Fund desires to make a Follow-On Investment in a portfolio company whose securities were acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction, the applicable Adviser will:
(i) Notify each Regulated Entity that participated in the Co-Investment Transaction of the proposed transaction at the earliest practical time; and
(ii) formulate a recommendation as to the proposed participation, including the amount of the proposed Follow-On Investment, by each Regulated Entity.
(b) A Regulated Entity may participate in such Follow-On Investment without obtaining prior approval of the Required Majority if: (i) The proposed participation of each Regulated Entity and each Affiliated Fund in such investment is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the issuer immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and (ii) the Board of the Regulated Entity has approved as being in the best interests of the Regulated Entity the ability to participate in Follow-On Investments on a pro rata basis (as described in greater detail in the application). In all other cases, the Adviser will provide its written recommendation as to the Regulated Entity's participation to the Eligible Directors, and the Regulated Entity will participate in such Follow-On Investment solely to the extent that a Required Majority determines that it is in the Regulated Entity's best interests.
(c) If, with respect to any Follow-On Investment:
(i) The amount of a Follow-On Investment is not based on the Regulated Entities' and the Affiliated Funds' outstanding investments immediately preceding the Follow-On Investment; and
(ii) the aggregate amount recommended by the Adviser to be invested by each Regulated Entity in the Follow-On Investment, together with the amount proposed to be invested by the participating Affiliated Funds in the same transaction, exceeds the amount of the opportunity; then the amount invested by each such party will be allocated among them pro rata based on each party's capital available for investment in the asset class being allocated, up to the amount proposed to be invested by each.
(d) The acquisition of Follow-On Investments as permitted by this condition will be considered a Co-Investment Transaction for all purposes and subject to the other conditions set forth in the application.
9. The Independent Managers of each Regulated Entity will be provided quarterly for review all information concerning Potential Co-Investment Transactions and Co-Investment Transactions, including investments made by other Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds that the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, so that the Independent Managers may determine whether all investments made during the preceding quarter, including those investments which the Regulated Entity considered but declined to participate in, comply with the conditions of the Order. In addition, the Independent Managers will consider at least annually the continued appropriateness for the Regulated Entity of participating in new and existing Co-Investment Transactions.
10. Each Regulated Entity will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the Act as if each of the Regulated Entities were a business development company (as defined in section 2(a)(48) of the Act) and each of the investments permitted under these conditions were approved by the Required Majority under section 57(f) of the Act.
11. No Independent Manager of a Regulated Entity will also be a director, general partner, managing member or principal, or otherwise an “affiliated person” (as defined in the Act) of an Affiliated Fund.
12. The expenses, if any, associated with acquiring, holding or disposing of any securities acquired in a Co-Investment Transaction (including, without limitation, the expenses of the distribution of any such securities registered for sale under the Securities Act) will, to the extent not payable by an Adviser under the investment advisory agreements with the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, be shared by the Affiliated Funds and the Regulated Entities in proportion to the relative amounts of the securities held or to be acquired or disposed of, as the case may be.Start Printed Page 18028

13. Any transaction fee [11] 
           (including break-up or commitment fees but excluding broker's fees contemplated by section 17(e) of the Act, as applicable), received in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction will be distributed to the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds on a pro rata basis based on the amounts they invested or committed, as the case may be, in such Co-Investment Transaction. If any transaction fee is to be held by the Adviser pending consummation of the transaction, the fee will be deposited into an account maintained by the Adviser at a bank or banks having the qualifications prescribed in section 26(a)(1) of the Act, and the account will earn a competitive rate of interest that will also be divided pro rata among the participating Regulated Entities and Affiliated Funds based on the amounts they invest in such Co-Investment Transaction. None of the Affiliated Funds, the Advisers, the other Regulated Entities or any affiliated person of the Regulated Entities or Affiliated Funds will receive additional compensation or remuneration of any kind as a result of or in connection with a Co-Investment Transaction (other than (a) in the case of the Regulated Entities and the Affiliated Funds, the pro rata transaction fees described above and fees or other compensation described in condition 2(c)(iii)(C); and (b) in the case of the Advisers, investment advisory fees paid in accordance with the agreements between the Advisers and the Regulated Entities or the Affiliated Funds).
14. The Advisers will each maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure compliance with the foregoing conditions. These policies and procedures will require, among other things, that the applicable Regulated Entity Adviser will be notified of all Potential Co-Investment Transactions that fall within a Regulated Entity's then-current Objectives and Strategies and will be given sufficient information to make its independent determination and recommendations under conditions 1, 2(a), 7 and 8.
15. If the Holders own in the aggregate more than 25 percent of the Shares of a Regulated Entity, then the Holders will vote such Shares as directed by an independent third party when voting on (1) the election of directors; (2) the removal of one or more directors; or (3) all other matters under either the Act or applicable State law affecting the Board's composition, size or manner of election.
16. Each Regulated Entity's chief compliance officer, as defined in Rule 38a-1(a)(4) under the 1940 Act, will prepare an annual report for its Board each year that evaluates (and documents the basis of that evaluation) the Regulated Entity's compliance with the terms and conditions of the application and the procedures established to achieve such compliance.
