ABOUT US










1946
Roger Marten founded Marten Transport, Ltd
                            . at the age of 17, delivering milk and other dairy products
                            from the Modena Co-op Creamery. He purchased his first truck route
                            with a $400 loan from his mother. His routes at that time were primarily
                            in the Modena, Wisconsin area where he was born and raised.





1956-1959
Marten purchases its first tractor-trailer combination and began hauling petroleum for Bauer Built of Durand, Wisconsin. Marten's volume doubled after the acquisition of Mondovi Trucking Co.





1960
Marten added its first tandem axle tractor to its fleet.





1965
A one-bay garage became Marten's first terminal in Mondovi, Wisconsin. Rogers' son Randy, also joined the company initially assisting with equipment maintenance and dispatch.





1972-1976
Marten began hauling milk to Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio,
                            expanding the company's long haul milk transport business. Marten also 
                            purchased Hiawatha Produce out of Winona, Minnesota. This acquisition was
                            the start of Marten's long-distance hauling of perishable foods in refrigerated
                            trailers and became the company's expertise.





1986
Marten began trading on the NASDAQ National Market at $13 per share. During the same year, Randy Marten became President, and the company exceeded $50 million in revenue and built a major expansion to its Mondovi headquarters.





1993
Marten suffered a tragic loss when Roger Marten passed away. Upon the death of his father, Randy Marten became the CEO of Marten Transport, Ltd., in addition to being President.





1995
The company positioned itself for maximum market flexibility with the addition of 53-foot trailers, and continued its nationwide growth with a maintenance facility in Wilsonville, Oregon, near Portland.





2005
Marten was honored as one of the top 200 Best Small Businesses in America by Forbes magazine.





2009
Increased cost, limited freight demand and distressed economy made for an uphill battle to be profitable. But successes in Intermodal and Brokerage opportunities led to significant growth and profitability. The company was once again named one of the Best 200 Small Businesses in America.






 


OUR FOUNDER

ROGERMARTEN


            Roger Marten founded Marten Transport, Ltd. in 1946 at the age of 17,
            delivering milk and other dairy products. His routes at that time
            were primarily in the Modena, Wisconsin area where Roger was born
            and raised. Driving for the Modena Co-op Creamery, Roger purchased
            his first truck route with a $400 loan from his mother. In the 1950's
            he expanded his milk delivery routes, purchased and drove school
            buses, and hauled petroleum products with his first tractor-trailer.
            In 1993 Marten suffered a tragic loss when Roger passed away.
            There are still many driving, office, and terminal employees working
            at Marten who were hired by Roger. Shortly after his passing,
            the Roger Marten Community Center was built in Mondovi, WI. The
            facility was dedicated to his memory in 1996.
        











OUR CEO

RANDYMARTEN


            Born and raised in the small western Wisconsin community where his
            father (Roger Marten) founded Marten Transport, Ltd., Randy Marten
            literally grew up in and around the transportation industry.
            Through the years Randy observed and participated in nearly
            every aspect of the family business. Those experiences helped
            prepare him for his current position as CEO of the company.
            During the past two decades - under his leadership, Marten
            Transport has experienced unprecedented growth and financial success.
        








"
Treat employees and customers with the respect
            they deserve, and success will come naturally.

- RANDY MARTEN

        QUALITY
      

        Quality is everything when you’re on the road. That’s why OTR Leasing works so diligently to find just the right truck to assure you stay on the road, not in the shop. In addition to finding you the right truck we also put each truck through a 150 point inspection and ensure that it meets the following requirements:


DOT
Tires, 12/32 or greater
Brakes, 50% or greater
New Mattress
No Body Damage over $500
PM Completed
DPF Cleaning





SUPPORT

        Despite our best efforts to find you a good solid truck, and your best efforts to take care of it, you are going to break down. Sometimes it’s not a big thing and can be quickly fixed cheaply. Other times, breakdowns can be catastrophic failures.  To guard against the catastrophic, OTR equips each truck with a 6 Month / 50,000 Mile Aftermarket Warranty at a minimum.  On certain trucks greater warranties are available, either remaining factory or aftermarket.  OTR Leasing is here for you with industry leading programs like our Maintenance Benefit Savings Program. We will help you save up for those unplanned repairs AND match a percentage of your contributions! On top of that, OTR Leasing includes access to Driver’s Roadside Service for 24 hour on-call emergency help and guidance to reputable shops.
      





        SUCCESS
      

        OTR Leasing is unique in the industry because we consider ourselves your partner in business. We’re not here to just lease you a truck; we’re here to support your success as an Owner Operator. Your success is our business. Along with OTR Leasing’s industry leading support programs, and helping you to stay ahead of the carriers, we are also always looking for the best shops and best deals on fuel and tires to share with you.  Continually we will check in with you to see how things are going out there. We want and need your feedback so we can help you to succeed. Then OTR will gather all this information and share it with you so you can stay up to date with all the current trends.
