NGF raises another $1.3 million, giving the fledgling firm a total of $2.5 million of capital. NGF invests $500,000 in an ice cream company: International Dairy Queen (IDQ). IDQ became a successful publicly-traded company that would eventually allow NGF to sell its stake for an estimated $3.5 million NGF makes an early investment in National Computer Systems, an optical reader company that is now a staple in virtually all standardized tests. Cray Research, a pioneer in supercomputing, is added to the NGF portfolio. NGF helps start Network Systems Corp., a company that pioneered the development of high speed data transmission products that would be the backbone of the first high speed computer networks. NGF raises its second fund, Northwest Venture Partners, a $60 million offering that included a $10 million contribution from Northwest Bancorporation. The firm transitions to the name Norwest Venture Capital (NVC). With the technology sector suffering from a downturn in the mid-1980s, NVC turns to opportunities in the consumer sector with investments in athletic footwear company Avia and children’s clothing company Gymboree. NVC’s East Coast presence takes shape with investments in Bright Horizons, GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Raptor Systems and VideoServer. George Still joins the firm and works out of its Bellevue, Washington office. Promod Haque also joins NVC as a consultant in the firm’s Minneapolis office to assist with due diligence on technology investments. NVC later hires Haque on a full-time basis in 1990.  The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners IV, LP,  a $200 million fund. NVC is instrumental in the development and consolidation of the emerging specialized mobile radio (SMR) communications business through investments in Atlantic Cellular, OneComm, and Transit Communications. PeopleSoft, one of the world’s first client server software companies, goes public. George Still led the firm’s investment in PeopleSoft in 1989, and Norwest was the sole venture investor. The investment helped drive the firm’s software strategy for years to come. George Still opens Norwest’s Silicon Valley office – on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, CA. Norwest continues its successful software streak, with investments in, and later exits from, Documentum, Vantive, and Xylan Coporation. Norwest completes a leveraged buyout of Transaction Systems Architects (TSA).  TSA goes public in 1995; Norwest would eventually realize $132 million on an investment of $8.6 million, a multiple of 15.4. The firm launches Norwest Equity Partners V, LP, a $300 Million fund. Promod Haque made his mark on such investments as Tivoli Systems (which went public in 1995 and was acquired by IBM in 1996) and Forte Software ( which went public in 1996 and was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 1999), generating returns of 32.0 and 23.0 times the firm’s initial investment, respectively. George Still and Norwest associate, Darin Brannan, develop the initial business plan for Verio, which was incubated in the firm’s West Coast office in 1996. At the time of Verio’s IPO in May 1998 at a $1.2 billion valuation, Verio had acquired 46 ISPs and was ultimately sold in 1999 to NTT DoComo for $5.5 billion cash. Promod Haque leads a seminal investment in Extreme Networks. Extreme was exceptionally successful, and with the help of a white-hot IPO market, delivered returns to NVC of more than $700 million, representing a multiple of 95.0 times its initial investment. The convergence of voice and data puts telecommunications at center stage with key NVC investments and exits. Brooks Fiber Properties goes public in 1996, and is acquired by MCI WorldCom in 1998 for $3.4 billion. Polycom results in a successful IPO in 1996. Brocade goes public in May of 1999, creating more than $313.5 million in returns for Norwest, a multiple of 46.0 times its original investment. Norwest moves its headquarters to downtown Palo Alto, CA – where it remains today. Norwest Venture Capital becomes Norwest Venture Partners (NVP), with George Still as Managing General Partner, launching Norwest Venture Partners VI (NVP VI), a $300 million fund. Norwest raises a brand new $325 million fund just one year later—Norwest Venture Partners VII (NVP VII), after a series of significant venture exits. Promod Haque transitions into a Managing General Partner role and joins Managing General Partner George Still in leading and expanding the firm. Norwest backs Michael Hatfield, co-founder and early CEO of Cerent, investing $11.8 million. Just 16 months later, Cisco Systems acquires Cerent for $7.2 billion. Cerent delivers returns of nearly $1.5 billion to Norwest, representing a multiple of 125.0 times the firm’s initial investment. Norwest invests $3.5 million in Siara Systems. Kleiner Perkins and Norwest later agree to merge Siara Systems with Redback Networks, a $4.3 billion transaction that in 1999 created one of the most powerful suppliers in the communications industry. Norwest’s investment in Siara Systems resulted in a 104 times return for the firm. Norwest makes a $7.2 million investment in Broadband Access Systems, a provider of highly integrated switching, broadband access and telephony systems for cable companies and carriers. A year later, ADC Telecommunications acquires Broadband Access Systems for $2.2 billion. Norwest raises an additional $300 million fund, Norwest Venture Partners VIII (NVP VIII), just two years after its previous fund had launched. Virtela, a virtual private network company, is funded and co-founded by General Partner Vab Goel. Norwest’s investment in Quantum Effect Devices (QED), an embedded microprocessor company, results in a successful IPO. Norwest eventually realizes $122 million on its investment of $5.2 million in QED, a multiple of 23.5. Israel-based Accord Networks, a voice and video company, goes public and is later sold to Polycom for $339 million. Norwest’s consistent returns over the previous decade helped the firm launch its largest fund to date in 2001—Norwest Venture Partners IX (NVP IX), a $411 million fund. SaaS emerges as a formidable infrastructure sector with Norwest’s investments in Cast Iron Systems and AmberPoint. Both companies would ultimately be acquired by tech giants IBM and Oracle, respectively. Norwest’s Matt Howard makes a significant investment in a wireless local area networking (“WLAN”) systems pioneer called Airespace. Winphoria Networks, a mobile data networking company, is sold to Motorola for $179 million. Norwest’s Vab Goel incubates Austin-based KMV Technologies, which would later be called LifeSize Communications, a pioneer in videoconferencing technology. Norwest portfolio company Spinnaker Networks, the Pittsburgh-based seller of network-attached storage servers, is acquired by Network Appliance Inc. for $300 million. Promod Haque ranks #1 on the 2004 Forbes Midas List as a top dealmaker. Norwest makes its first investment in India, a growth equity investment in Persistent Systems, a leading offshore product development company based in Pune. The company would later go public on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India. Local area networking (“WLAN”) systems provider Airespace is acquired by Cisco Systems for $450 million. Norwest notches additional big exits with Arbortext, Authentica, Corio, Open-Silicon, ShoreTel, Sidestep, Skystream, Veraz Networks and Website Pros. The firm raises Norwest Venture Partners X (NVP X), a $650 million fund. In an effort to diversify and invest across multiple stages and sectors in India, Norwest establishes a day-to-day presence in the country via its NVP India advisory subsidiary in Mumbai, led by Niren Shah and Sohil Chand. Norwest expands further, establishing an advisory subsidiary in Herzliya, Israel, led by Dror Nahumi. Norwest adds a second Indian subsidiary in Bengaluru, led by Mohan Kumar. Norwest benefits from Rackspace’s successful initial public offering as the largest venture investor in the company. Rackspace is one of the largest and only technology IPOs occurring this year. Qumranet, an enterprise software company offering a virtual infrastructure platform, is acquired by Red Hat. Norwest portfolio company LifeSize Communications is sold to Logitech for $405 million. Norwest brings on Jon Kossow to focus more aggressively on growth equity opportunities and build out Norwest’s growth equity team. General Partners Jon Kossow and Sonya Brown now head up the growth equity practice at Norwest. Norwest begins investing out of its largest fund to date, Norwest Venture Partners XI (NVP XI), a $1.2 billion fund. Norwest revives its healthcare practice with an emphasis on growth equity and late stage venture investments.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond. Matt Howard has been a tremendous part of this path for us at Blue Jeans and is available to us 24×7. Matt has brokered strategic relationships, including those that have led directly to revenue.

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1]
In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Leadership[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.
Promod Haque joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[9] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[9] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[9]
Jeff Crowe joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Lending Club (NYSE: LC) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ: SALE) and private companies Extole, Glint, HoneyBook, Madison Reed, Modsy, Opendoor, Owler, Talkspace and Turn. Crowe is a board observer at Minted and is responsible for Norwest's investments in Jet.com (acquired by Walmart), Spotify, and Uber.[10] He was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.[11]
Matthew Howard joined Norwest in 2000 as a general partner and was named a managing partner in 2013.[12] He has appeared on the Forbes Midas List as a top 100 investor three times and was recognized in 2013 by Business Insider as one of the “19 Best Enterprise Tech Venture Capitalists.”[13] He focuses his efforts on mobile, security, rich media, cloud-based services/applications, networking and storage sectors. He serves on the board of several companies, including Avere Systems, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Bluenose Analytics, Exabeam, Mist Systems and MobileIron (Nasdaq: MOBL). He serves on the Technical Advisory Board for In-Q-Tel's Lab 41 initiative to address mission-critical problems for the United States Intelligence Community. Before joining Norwest, Howard was an early employee of Cisco.[14]
George J. Still, Jr., partner emeritus, was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2011.[15]

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1]
In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Leadership[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.
Promod Haque joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[9] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[9] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[9]
Jeff Crowe joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy.

Norwest Venture Partners traces its roots back to 1961 with the formation of the Northwest Venture Fund, a private equity and venture capital affiliate of Norwest Corporation, a midwestern bank based in Minneapolis that merged with Wells Fargo in 1998.[3] In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Minneapolis was an early site for both venture capital and high-technology business.
The VC industry was active with the formation of the first Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and First Midwest Capital Corporation. In 1957, Control Data Corporation, a pioneering supercomputer company, was founded by William Norris. Two years later Norris was instrumental in the formation of the Northwest Growth Fund and the firm was active in the Minneapolis high-tech industry.
The Northwest Growth Fund grew under the leadership of CEO Robert Zicarelli including the opening of an office in Silicon Valley. Zicarelli retired in 1988 and was succeeded by Daniel Haggerty who retired in the 1990s.[4] George J, Still, Jr. (now partner emeritus)[5] and Promod Haque took over as managing partners in 1994.
In January 2016, the firm announced Norwest Venture Partners XIII, a $1.2B fund. NVP XIII marked Norwest's third consecutive $1.2B fund raised in fewer than six years.[1]
In 2016, 14 of Norwest's portfolio companies went public or were acquired. The number includes four public offerings in the U.S., India and Israel and 10 company acquisitions.[6]
Portfolio services[edit]
Norwest provides resources to funded companies through its Portfolio Services group. Resources include strategies and services for employee talent and retention, market development, human resources, public relations and marketing, and operations. The group manages the Norwest Loop, an online community for company leaders to use for sharing information and experiences with each other and their Norwest contacts.[7]
The Portfolio Services group also hosts events for Norwest-funded companies several times a year. Topics have included educational technology, demand generation strategies, employer branding, and an event series focused on female founders of companies.[8]
Leadership[edit]
Norwest is led by senior managing partner Promod Haque and managing partners Jeff Crowe and Matthew Howard.
Promod Haque joined Norwest in 1990. As of early 2016, his investments in more than 70 companies have produced more than $40B in exit values, as 25 of his portfolio companies have gone public and 37 have been acquired (or have gone public and been acquired).[9] His most notable deal was cybersecurity company FireEye, which had the second-best performing initial public offering (IPO) in the U.S. in 2013.[9] His recent investments include Dtex Systems, Palerra, Shape Security, Health Catalyst, and CareCloud. Haque has been named to the Forbes Midas List of top tech investors since 2001, and in 2014 was named by Forbes as a “Hall of Fame” investor. 2017 marked his 13th appearance on the list, including 2004, when he was ranked the #1 venture capitalist based on performance over the previous decade.[9]
Jeff Crowe joined Norwest in 2004 and became a managing partner in 2013. He worked in the tech world for 20 years as cofounder and CEO of software company Edify. In recent years, Crowe has invested in Jet.com, as well as HoneyBook and Modsy. He currently serves on the boards of public companies Lending Club (NYSE: LC) and RetailMeNot (NASDAQ: SALE) and private companies Extole, Glint, HoneyBook, Madison Reed, Modsy, Opendoor, Owler, Talkspace and Turn. Crowe is a board observer at Minted and is responsible for Norwest's investments in Jet.com (acquired by Walmart), Spotify, and Uber.[10] He was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.[11]
Matthew Howard joined Norwest in 2000 as a general partner and was named a managing partner in 2013.[12] He has appeared on the Forbes Midas List as a top 100 investor three times and was recognized in 2013 by Business Insider as one of the “19 Best Enterprise Tech Venture Capitalists.”[13] He focuses his efforts on mobile, security, rich media, cloud-based services/applications, networking and storage sectors. He serves on the board of several companies, including Avere Systems, Bitglass, Blue Jeans Network, Bluenose Analytics, Exabeam, Mist Systems and MobileIron (Nasdaq: MOBL). He serves on the Technical Advisory Board for In-Q-Tel's Lab 41 initiative to address mission-critical problems for the United States Intelligence Community. Before joining Norwest, Howard was an early employee of Cisco.[14]
George J. Still, Jr., partner emeritus, was named to the Forbes Midas List in 2011.[15]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
