History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]

History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site.

History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site. The facility opened on May 15, 2012.
Awards and recognition[edit]
Jabil has been the recipient of many awards and recognition. It was the first ever recipient of the Mexican government's National Quality Award which was given to it in 2006. This award is given to organizations recognized for their total quality management practices.[32]
The company was awarded with the Excellence in Best Practices Award from Frost & Sullivan in 2009. The company also received an HR award in Poland[33] and a NEC Solution America's Favored Supplier Award.[34] Jabil was awarded with the 2010 Save Energy Now Award by the United States Department of Energy.
Jabil made the list of Newsweek S&P 500 Green Companies in 2011. It was the 3rd consecutive year for Jabil to be on the list, improving each year from number 200 to number 127 in 2011 They were also given the 2010-2011 Annual Enterprise of Harmonious Labor Relation of Guangzhou City award.[35]

History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site. The facility opened on May 15, 2012.
Awards and recognition[edit]
Jabil has been the recipient of many awards and recognition. It was the first ever recipient of the Mexican government's National Quality Award which was given to it in 2006. This award is given to organizations recognized for their total quality management practices.[32]
The company was awarded with the Excellence in Best Practices Award from Frost & Sullivan in 2009. The company also received an HR award in Poland[33] and a NEC Solution America's Favored Supplier Award.[34] Jabil was awarded with the 2010 Save Energy Now Award by the United States Department of Energy.
Jabil made the list of Newsweek S&P 500 Green Companies in 2011. It was the 3rd consecutive year for Jabil to be on the list, improving each year from number 200 to number 127 in 2011 They were also given the 2010-2011 Annual Enterprise of Harmonious Labor Relation of Guangzhou City award.[35]
In 2012, Jabil was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Fortune 500 Most Admired Companies Jabil was also awarded with the 2012 Kaizen Award in China by 1MFG and Masaaki lmai’s Kaizen Institute Consulting Group (KICG).[36] In 2012, Tim Main, former CEO and current Chairman of the Board, and Bill Morean, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, won Entrepreneur of the Year Awards from Ernst & Young, LLC for the Florida region.[37] Jabil Circuit Shanghai received the Institute of Engineers Lean Best Practice Award in 2014, an award given in recognition of innovation and Lean Six Sigma capabilities.[38]

The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site. The facility opened on May 15, 2012.
Awards and recognition[edit]

The company was awarded with the Excellence in Best Practices Award from Frost & Sullivan in 2009. The company also received an HR award in Poland[33] and a NEC Solution America's Favored Supplier Award.[34] Jabil was awarded with the 2010 Save Energy Now Award by the United States Department of Energy.

Jabil Inc. Enhances Supply Chain Network Optimization with New T3 Policy Readiness Assessment
Jun 28 17
Jabil Inc. introduced the T3 Policy Readiness Assessment service to help companies better understand and respond to potential changes in global trade, tax and tariff policies. Fueled by Jabil’s Intelligent Digital Supply Chain (IDSC), the service integrates optimization algorithms and simulations with meaningful, data-driven insights for improving manufacturing agility while lowering cost and risk. Each T3 Policy Readiness Assessment delivers benchmarking data on costs and risks associated with manufacturing in different geographies, leveraging Jabil’s vast domain expertise, predictive analytics, deterministic modeling and network optimization tools. Complementary global tariff and tax policy, administration and modeling provide broader perspective to identify policy change probabilities and their impact. Additionally, organizations receive manufacturing and distribution footprint impact assessments based on fluctuations in trade agreement policies. Each evaluation offers insights on domestic manufacturing strategies, enabling U.S. companies to quickly determine the viability of moving manufacturing closer to end-markets to better accommodate American customer demand. Equally important, the assessment measures supply chain risks, especially if moving a supply base from Asia to the United States creates single-source suppliers. Jabil’s T3 Policy Readiness Assessment service is available immediately, with findings and recommendations deliverable in as little as six weeks, ensuring customers can transform supply chain and manufacturing operations with exceptional speed and agility.

History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site. The facility opened on May 15, 2012.
Awards and recognition[edit]
Jabil has been the recipient of many awards and recognition. It was the first ever recipient of the Mexican government's National Quality Award which was given to it in 2006. This award is given to organizations recognized for their total quality management practices.[32]
The company was awarded with the Excellence in Best Practices Award from Frost & Sullivan in 2009. The company also received an HR award in Poland[33] and a NEC Solution America's Favored Supplier Award.[34] Jabil was awarded with the 2010 Save Energy Now Award by the United States Department of Energy.
Jabil made the list of Newsweek S&P 500 Green Companies in 2011. It was the 3rd consecutive year for Jabil to be on the list, improving each year from number 200 to number 127 in 2011 They were also given the 2010-2011 Annual Enterprise of Harmonious Labor Relation of Guangzhou City award.[35]
In 2012, Jabil was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Fortune 500 Most Admired Companies Jabil was also awarded with the 2012 Kaizen Award in China by 1MFG and Masaaki lmai’s Kaizen Institute Consulting Group (KICG).[36] In 2012, Tim Main, former CEO and current Chairman of the Board, and Bill Morean, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, won Entrepreneur of the Year Awards from Ernst & Young, LLC for the Florida region.[37] Jabil Circuit Shanghai received the Institute of Engineers Lean Best Practice Award in 2014, an award given in recognition of innovation and Lean Six Sigma capabilities.[38]

Jabil has acquired numerous companies and arms of companies.

History[edit]
The company's name derives from those of its two founders, James Golden and Bill Morean, who founded the company in 1966. Jabil was incorporated in 1969. An early product was PCBs.[2]
In the 1980s, the company was making parts for PC companies like Dell,[2] and this continued through the mid 1990s.[8]
The company went public in 1993.[9] In 1998, Jabil began trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol JBL.[10] The company was added to the S&P 500 Index in 2001.[11] The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12]
On March 1, 2013, Jabil appointed William E. Peters as President and William D. Muir, Jr. as Chief Operating Officers. Both had been with Jabil for more than 20 years. On the same day, Mark Mondello was appointed to CEO, replacing Timothy Main, who was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors.[13] The appointments were sparked by the retirement of Board Chairman William Morean whose father founded Jabil in 1966.[14]
The company reports on its website that it operates 90 plants in 23 different countries.[3]
The company was moved from the S&P 500 Index to the S&P MidCap 400 Index in 2014.[12] Jabil announced that it is closing its first European international plant in Livingston, UK in 2017. 266 employees will be losing their jobs in Livingston, UK.[15] Jabil laid off approximately 400 people in Sept 2016, 100 of those being corporate employees located in St. Petersburg Florida.[16]
Business areas[edit]
Jabil customers span numerous industries, including healthcare, life sciences, clean technology, instrumentation, defense, aerospace, automotive, computing, storage, consumer products, networking and telecommunications.[17] Its services include design engineering, manufacturing and supply chain services for the EMS and consumer industries; and materials technology services (plastics, metals, automation and tooling). Jabil diversifies their business into three areas.[18]
Services[edit]
Jabil is involved in design engineering services. The company has industrial design services that concentrate on designing the look and feel of plastic and metal enclosures that house printed circuit board assemblies and systems. Mechanical design services of Jabil include dimensional design and analysis of electronic and optical assemblies. Computer assisted design from Jabil includes printed circuit board assembly design testing and verification and other consulting services.[18]
Design engineering[edit]
Jabil has an industry-specific design team for each of the industries that they supply including computer and storage, digital home, healthcare and instrumentation, point of sale, and mobile.[19] Jabil has assisted many Fortune 500 companies with design and engineering including inventing the Sandy Creek, a dual Intel Xeon E5-2690 (Sandy Bridge Romley-EP) based reference design for use in customer applications.[20] Jabil also assisted Cisco with value engineering by placing RFID in circuit boards to store data about the host board.[21]
Supply chain and logistics[edit]
Jabil provides supply chain and logistic services. These services include electronic sourcing, virtual / vertical mechanics, logistics, supply chain management, advanced planning, quality, standardized global systems, and supply chain solutions and business analytics. Examples of the company's supply chain and logistics management were seen during the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan.[22] When supply chain disruption occurred, Jabil re-routed supply from alternative sources, allocated limited production to key customers and distributors, specify and quality alternative parts, and called on existing suppliers to help reduce the impact of the disruptions.[23][24] Jabil was able to do the same during the 2010 and 2011 Thailand floods.[25]
Company culture[edit]
Over the years, Jabil has received awards for its community engagement and business practices. Jabil’s organizational culture supports numerous social and environmental responsibility initiatives and embraces lean thinking throughout the organization. The company also has its own university that it uses to promote employees from within the company. The university has programs for Operator To Supervisor, Blue Collar to White Collar, and White Collar to Future Manager.[citation needed]
Jabil's company culture uses the concept of lean manufacturing which is the process of driving improvement and innovation by reducing waste and increasing process speed. In September 2011, Jabil hosted 14,000 Kaizen Blitz events. Kaizen is a Japanese term for improvement and Kaizen events are focused projects that aim to improve processes. Many of Jabil's senior leaders are currently undergoing or have already achieved Six Sigma Black Belt Certification (a Jack Welch principle).[26]
Jabil also holds an annual improvement competition known as "Deliver Best Practices." This is a company-wide (and worldwide) competition to recognize, support, and promote process advancements within the company. Employee teams enter innovative and cost-saving projects into the Deliver Best Practices competition. After several rounds, the top twenty four projects from the global teams win a trip to Jabil's corporate offices and present their projects to company executives in person. One project in four different categories is chosen and the team receives a $10,000 prize.[27]
Social and environmental responsibility[edit]
Jabil is involved in both social and environmental responsibility.[28] Jabil employs a Director of Social and Environmental Responsibility as part of their company who also serves on the Board of Directors for the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition. Jabil is also involved with charity and non-profit organizations outside of the Tampa / St. Petersburg area as well. They are a donor for the Guadalajara Los Pinos Boys Shelter in Los Pinos, Mexico.[29] In Japan, Jabil Gotemba employees harvest and sell fruits to Jabil employees and use the proceeds to purchase and donate wheelchairs to the Gotemba community.[30] Jabil employee Rick Smiley climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro in 2011 to raise money for charity. The funds that he raised went to an orphanage in Kenya called "New Hope."[31]
As part of the company's global initiative, more than 7,000 Jabil employees donated money to help the victim's of the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Jabil Green Point Wuxi and Wuxi Konggang Industrial Park teamed up to build the Shuofang Agricultural Sanatorium for the Disabled and the Health and Happiness Garden on site. The facility opened on May 15, 2012.
Awards and recognition[edit]
Jabil has been the recipient of many awards and recognition. It was the first ever recipient of the Mexican government's National Quality Award which was given to it in 2006. This award is given to organizations recognized for their total quality management practices.[32]
The company was awarded with the Excellence in Best Practices Award from Frost & Sullivan in 2009. The company also received an HR award in Poland[33] and a NEC Solution America's Favored Supplier Award.[34] Jabil was awarded with the 2010 Save Energy Now Award by the United States Department of Energy.
Jabil made the list of Newsweek S&P 500 Green Companies in 2011. It was the 3rd consecutive year for Jabil to be on the list, improving each year from number 200 to number 127 in 2011 They were also given the 2010-2011 Annual Enterprise of Harmonious Labor Relation of Guangzhou City award.[35]
In 2012, Jabil was recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Fortune 500 Most Admired Companies Jabil was also awarded with the 2012 Kaizen Award in China by 1MFG and Masaaki lmai’s Kaizen Institute Consulting Group (KICG).[36] In 2012, Tim Main, former CEO and current Chairman of the Board, and Bill Morean, former Chairman of the Board of Directors, won Entrepreneur of the Year Awards from Ernst & Young, LLC for the Florida region.[37] Jabil Circuit Shanghai received the Institute of Engineers Lean Best Practice Award in 2014, an award given in recognition of innovation and Lean Six Sigma capabilities.[38]
Acquisitions and expansion[edit]
Jabil has acquired numerous companies and arms of companies. Their acquisitions have helped them expand their presence in countries such as China, Mexico, India, Spain, the Netherlands and Russia to name a few.[2][39] In 2011, Jabil opened a Photovoltaic Certification and Testing Laboratory in St. Petersburg, FL.[40] In February 2013, Jabil announced it would be purchasing Nypro for $665 Million in cash.[41] The purchase was completed in July 2013.[42][43]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About JABIL CIRCUIT, INC.

   Jabil Circuit makes a jabillion different kinds of electronics. The company is one of the leading providers of outsourced electronics manufacturing services (EMS) in the world. It makes electronics components and parts on a contract basis for computers, smartphones, printers, and other consumer electronics, as well as more complex, specialized products for the aerospace, automotive, and healthcare industries. The company's services range from product design and component procurement to product testing, order fulfillment, and supply chain management. Jabil Circuit operates some 103 plants in about 30 countries across the Americas, Asia, and Europe.
  
Operations

   Jabil Circuit conducts business in two segments: Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) and Diversified Manufacturing Services (DMS).
  

   The EMS segment (60% of revenue) focuses on IT, supply chain design, and engineering for all things electronic. Customers' products are used in applications for automotive, digital home, industrial and energy, networking and telecommunications, point of sale, printing, and storage.
  

   The DMS segment (40% of revenue) focuses on manufacturing services for material sciences and technologies. It works with customers to develop and manufacture products for consumer lifestyles and wearable technologies, defense and aerospace, emerging growth, healthcare, mobility, and packaging.
  
Geographic Reach

   Jabil Circuit's plants are located in Argentina, Brazil, China, Finland, Hungary, India, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine, and Vietnam, as well as in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Scotland, the Netherlands, and the US.
  

   Singapore, and China are its largest markets, accounting for about 27% and 21% of sales, respectively. Customers in Mexico and the US generate 17% and 9% of revenue, respectively.
  
Sales and Marketing

   Jabil Circuit depends on a small number of customers for a significant percentage of revenue - five customers account for 49% of sales. Its top customer is Apple (24% of sales) and other significant customers are Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, HP Inc., LM Ericsson, General Electric, Ingenico, NetApp, Valeo, and Zebra Technologies.
  
Financial Performance

   Revenue rose 2.5% to $18.3 billion in 2016 (ended August) on sales increases of 3% and 2% in its two segments. Geographically only the Mexico market posted a gain, of 20%, from 2015 to 2016. The rise in sales came from its mobility business in the first half of the year and from telecommunications equipment.
  

   Profit slipped 10.5% in 2016 from 2015 to $254 million. Higher costs for selling, general, and administrative functions rose 7% mainly because Jabil increased hiring and salaries to support growth. It also had higher amortization expenses related to intangible assets in acquisitions.
  

   Cash flow from operations dropped to $916 million in 2016 from $1.2 billion in 2015. Part of the drop stemmed from a decrease in accounts receivable because of reduced consumer demand in the mobility business in the second half of 2016 in combination with cash collection efforts.
  
Strategy

   To compete in a rapidly consolidating industry, Jabil provides production on a global scale and operates through semi-autonomous business units that are dedicated to individual customers. The company continues to add services and to expand globally through acquisitions, including deals to acquire manufacturing operations from customers looking to reduce costs through outsourcing. The company tends to place manufacturing plants close to its customers.
  

   In emphasizing that geographic strategy, Jabil is expanding its manufacturing operations in order to provide products of equivalent or comparable quality throughout the world. It has established and acquired operations in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
  
Mergers and Acquisitions

   Acquisitions have extended Jabil's product portfolio and its geographic reach.
  

   In January 2016 Jabil acquired Inala, a South African energy products provider and systems integrator. The deal acquisition expanded Jabil's presence in the market for remote location energy products and marked its first venture in Africa.
  

   In June 2015 Jabil acquired Clothing+, which makes the sensor fabric in the Victoria's Secret smart bra. It has been integrating electronics into textiles for almost two decades.
  

   In August 2015, Jabil acquired Kasalis, which makes sophisticated systems used in the assembly high-precision optical equipment.
  

   In 2015 Jabil's healthcare and packaging division, Nypro, acquired Plasticos Castella, a molder of plastic lids for condiments. Nypro's acquisition of Plasticos Castella expands smart packaging capabilities by combining design, engineering, and manufacturing facilities in Spain and Hungary with the services of Nypro's six North American plants.
