This is a great addition to any beach or lake house. Installation requires knowledge of basic plumbing (soldering and pipe fitting) to connect this faucet to hot and cold pipes inside the house. All it takes to install it on the outside are two holes to slide it through the wall and two screws to attach it. Depending on your interior plumbing the entire project takes just a couple of hours start to finish. I connected it with a garden hose to a free standing shower (approx $100) in my backyard and planted bamboo plants to form a shower stall. All very inexpensive but works and looks great! All my guests and kids love it.
