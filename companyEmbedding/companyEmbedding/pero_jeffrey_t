GastroEase Rescue


“We’ve always had to lead Wings into the arena – it was one of his quirks, or so we thought. After we started using GastroEase Rescue, he began entering the ring willingly. Settling his stomach solved a problem that we didn’t know was related to his gut. We’ll be using GastroEase Rescue on Wings from now on!”

I love Pero. My favorite winter drink. Being on hemo dialysis I would like to know the amounts of potassium and phosphros as these two minerals can make or break me having it.

Response:  There is 13 mg of potassium per 100 ml of PERO.  There is no phosphorus in PERO.

I had to give up coffee, so tried Pero, and I love it. I'm also supposed to stick to low fiber stuff. Do you have information on fiber content? I'm hoping something that dissolves/suspends so well can't be in the same fiber category as a thick barley soup.

Response: The manufacturers claim is the following:
"100 g Pero contains 8 g of dietary fibers, which equals a content of 0,176 g per cup (when prepared with 2,2g Pero).
This quantity would be too small to talk about diuretic properties of Pero."  We are assuring this means that it has negligible diuretic effects on the body. We would be happy to be more specific if you have further questions.

A new natural foods market named 'Natural Grocers' recently 
opened its doors on 3650 E. 2nd St., Casper, WY and carries 
PERO. I just wanted to pass that on to you (and to potential  
customers) so that you may add that to your website's Google 
map locator.

I purchased a 4.4 ounce jar of PERO from the new store and am 
thankful that it carries it, as regular black coffee, which I enjoyed 
drinking, has begun to have adverse effect on my stomach. It's good to see your product in town.

Response:  Thank you for the location and we are glad you are enjoying pero.  Natural Grocers has been added to our store locator!

Love your product. Great coffee flavor with no caffeine. My only concern is that I have discovered I am gluten sensitive.  There is gluten in rye and barley but is it prevalent in the finished product?

Response: Pero beverage does contain grains. After checking with the manufacturer, we have confirmed that Pero does contain a very small amount of gluten in the range of 376 mg per 1 kg ( 2.2 lbs of product ). As always, we advise that you check with your doctor to determine if this level of gluten would adversely affect you. Please let us know if you have further questions.

Hello, Can you tell me if Pero is 'non acidic' or if it is 'low acid', what would the acid content be compare to coffee and where does the acid come from? 

Thank you the product tastes the best out of the coffee alternatives out there.

JG

Response: PH level of Pero is 4
PH level of coffee is around 4,8 to 5,7 (depending on the roasting)

I just ordered some PERO and noticed that your formula has changed to add Rye.  Does this ingredient addition change the flavor?  Why did you decide to change the formula?

Response: For over 10 years, ending in late 2009, the U.S. government assigned arbitrary  punitive duties on imports of chicory in response to a beef dispute with European countries.  Strange but true.  This resulted in a 100% duty on all Pero products.  For this reason, we turned to Switzerland to produce our products over this 10 year period.  As a result, any change in suppliers of raw materials may result in slight changes in the finished product, even though every attempt is made to minimize these deviations as we have moved production back to Germany. Sorry for any inconvenience.

Thank you - We absolutely love this product, and hope that it will taste just as good when we receive our new order!

Please bring back the Swiss recipe. We much prefer it.

Response: We appreciate that we have such loyal consumers.  This was a manufacturer decision based on many factors. We will pass on your comments and let them know your concerns. Sorry I don't have better news.

Do you still import the Pero coffee substitute from Switzerland or only the product of Germany? I am writing from a Whole Foods Market in Walnut Creek, CA on behalf of a customer who wants the Swiss version; says the two are very different in color & flavor.

I am wondering why I suddenly can't find Pero in any of my grocery stores.  Are they still making it?  I am imagining the Postum scare from a few years ago.

Response: Sorry for the scare, but we promise you that we have no intention of discontinuing pero.  There was a disruption in supply that was caused by a clerical error on my part. In other words, we just didn't order enough to meet the demand.  This has been corrected and you should see the product back on the shelves shortly. Sorry again and thank you for enjoying pero.
