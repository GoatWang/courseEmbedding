1Forbes rates funds separately in both up and down market cycles. Funds are rated against their peers and are awarded letter grades (A+ to F) based on peformance in bull and bear markets. Market cycles are defined by an index or blend of indices. Stock funds, for example, are rated and benchmarked over four bullish and bearish cycles using the S&P 500 as a benchmark. The peformance benchmark for Balanced funds is a 50/50 blended index of the S&P 500 and the Merrill Lynch corporate/government bond index. Most bond funds are rated for five years, with each month treated as either a bullish or bearish month. Exception: taxable junk bond funds, which are presently rated over a 12-year period corresponding to the three most recent market cycles of the Merrill Lynch high yield bond index. 2Annual expense ratio plus brokerage commissions paid by the fund for buying and selling securities. p: Prior year.

NOTICE OF SUBADVISER CHANGE                                                     

This information statement mailed on or about Sept. 25, 2006, is being          
provided to the shareholders of RiverSource Small Cap Growth Fund (the          
"Fund"), a series of RiverSource Strategy Series, Inc., in lieu of a proxy      
statement, pursuant to the terms of an exemptive order that the Fund has        
received from the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). This exemptive    
order permits RiverSource Investments, LLC ("RiverSource Investments" or        
"Investment Manager"), subject to approval of the Board of Directors (the       
"Board"), to select the subadvisers RiverSource Investments or the              
Investment Manager believes are best suited to achieve the Fund's investment    
objective. RiverSource Investments or the Investment Manager exercises this     
authority by adding or replacing subadvisers.                                   

WE ARE NOT ASKING YOU FOR A PROXY AND YOU ARE REQUESTED NOT TO SEND US A PROXY. 
THE FUND AND ITS MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT                                           

RiverSource Investments serves as investment manager to the Fund pursuant to    
an Investment Management Services Agreement (the "IMS Agreement") dated         
March 1, 2006, amended and restated as of May 1, 2006. Under the IMS            
Agreement, RiverSource Investments monitors the performance of the              
subadvisers on an ongoing basis. Factors it considers are: the                  
qualifications of a subadviser's investment personnel, its investment           
philosophy and process, and its long-term performance results. Short-term       
investment performance, by itself, is not a significant factor in               
recommending a change of a subadviser. As compensation for its services,        
RiverSource Investments receives a management fee from the Fund and             
RiverSource Investments pays the subadviser(s). Subadvisers serve pursuant      
to separate subadvisory agreements (each a "Subadvisory Agreement") under       
which each manages the portion of the investment portfolio allocated to it      
by RiverSource Investments, and provides related compliance and                 
record-keeping services. In accordance with procedures adopted by the Board,    
a subadviser or its affiliated broker-dealer, may execute portfolio             
transactions for a Fund and receive brokerage commissions in connection with    
those transactions as permitted by Section 17(e) of the Investment Company      
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), or separate SEC exemptive

relief. A subadviser is allowed to use soft dollar arrangements in which it     
directs brokerage commissions to brokers to pay for research services,          
provided that the subadviser's procedures are acceptable to RiverSource         
Investments and consistent with Board and RiverSource Investments policies.     

MDTA 
AND THE NEW SUBADVISORY AGREEMENT                                               

At a meeting of the Board on Sept. 7-8, 2005, the Board, including a            
majority of the Board members who are not interested persons of the Fund        
within the meaning of the 1940 Act (the "independent Board members"),           
approved the recommendation of RiverSource Investments to approve a             
Subadvisory Agreement with MDT Advisers, a division of Harris Bretall           
Sullivan & Smith LLC ("MDTA"), which became effective on Sept. 23, 2005         
("Initial Subadvisory Agreement"). On July 14, 2006, Federated Investors,       
Inc. acquired MDTA. Under the provisions of the Investment Company Act of       
1940, this acquisition resulted in the automatic termination of the Initial     
Subadvisory Agreement. Consequently, it was necessary for the Board to          
approve a new subadvisory agreement between RiverSource Investments, LLC and    
MDTA as a division of Federated MDTA, LLC, an indirect subsidiary of            
Federated Investors, Inc. (the "New Subadvisory Agreement") and to provide      
this notice to shareholders. At a meeting of the Board held on July 12-13,      
2006, the Board members, including a majority of the independent Board          
members, approved the New Subadvisory Agreement effective on July 14, 2006.     

Under the IMS Agreement, the Fund pays RiverSource Investments a fee as         
follows:

OPTIMUM Q-SMALL CAP GROWTH INSTITUTIONAL COMPOSITE       $79,882,740      100 to 115 basis points

As of July 31, 2006, the Optimum Q-Small Cap Growth Institutional Composite     
consisted of four discretionary accounts.                                       

BOARD CONSIDERATIONS                                                            

In evaluating the recommendation to approve the New Subadvisory Agreement       
between RiverSource and MDTA, the Board considered that the only change         
between the Initial Subadvisory Agreement and the New Subadvisory Agreement     
was the change in control of the subadviser. The Board noted that it had        
considered the following factors in approving the Initial Subadvisory           
Agreement in September 2005:                                                    

o   The favorable history, reputation, qualification and background of the      
subadviser, as well as the qualifications of the subadviser's personnel 
and its financial condition.                                            

o   The expertise that the subadviser offers in providing portfolio             
management services to other similar portfolios and the performance     
history of those portfolios.                                            

o   The subadviser's proposed investment strategy for the Fund.                 

o   The subadviser's long- and short-term performance relative to comparable    
mutual funds and unmanaged indexes.                                     

o   The compliance program of the subadviser.                                   

The terms of the New Subadvisory Agreement are consistent with the language     
of the registration statements of the Fund and the IMS Agreement between the    
Fund and RiverSource Investments.
