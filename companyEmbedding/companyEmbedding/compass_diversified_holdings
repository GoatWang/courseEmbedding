WESTPORT, Conn., June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE:    CODI) ("CODI" or the "Company"), an owner of leading middle market businesses, announced that on June 2, 2017, it entered into an agreement to acquire and consummated the acquisition of Crosman Corporation ("Crosman"). 


Crosman is the world's leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of airguns, archery products, optics and related accessories. Headquartered in East Bloomfield, NY, Crosman serves over 425 customers worldwide, including mass merchants, sporting goods retailers, online channels and distributors serving smaller specialty stores and international markets. The company's diversified product portfolio includes the widely known Crosman, Benjamin and CenterPoint brands. For the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2017, Crosman reported net revenue of approximately $118 million.
The acquisition was completed for a purchase price of approximately $152 million (excluding working capital and other customary adjustments). CODI funded the purchase price through available cash on its balance sheet and a draw on its revolving credit facility. CODI's equity ownership in Crosman as a result of this transaction is approximately 98.9%. Crosman's management team invested in the transaction alongside CODI. The Company previously owned a majority stake in Crosman and divested the business in 2007.
"Crosman is a market leader with iconic brands and we are pleased to add the company to our family of niche leading businesses with this accretive acquisition," said Alan Offenberg, CEO of Compass Diversified Holdings. "Crosman's strategic focus on the airgun and archery markets has enabled the company to generate strong and stable cash flows while entering into an attractive adjacent market with compelling growth prospects. We are excited to draw on our past ownership of Crosman and deep experience with outdoor branded consumer product companies, and look forward to working with the company's strong management team to solidify Crosman's leading position in airguns and further penetrate the archery market." 
Mr. Offenberg added, "This transaction, our second platform acquisition in the last nine months, brings the current number of leading niche industrial and branded consumer businesses we own to nine. We expect the acquisition to provide approximately $0.12 per share of cash flow accretion to CODI on a full year basis. Moving ahead, we will continue to take advantage of our financial strength and liquidity to pursue attractive businesses with a reason to exist that will generate growing cash flows and further enhance our ability to provide sizeable cash distributions to our shareholders."
Additional information on the acquisition will be available on the Company's current report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
About Compass Diversified Holdings ("CODI")CODI owns and manages a diverse family of established North American middle market businesses. Each of its current subsidiaries is a leader in its niche market.
CODI maintains controlling ownership interests in each of its subsidiaries in order to maximize its ability to impact long term cash flow generation and value. The Company provides both debt and equity capital for its subsidiaries, contributing to their financial and operating flexibility. CODI utilizes the cash flows generated by its subsidiaries to invest in the long-term growth of the Company and to make cash distributions to its shareholders.
Our nine majority-owned subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:

The Most Important Question When Selling Your Business Isn’t How Much, But — To Whom ?














Selling a business isn’t only about the bottom line.
After all, what is a business without the people who helped build it? That’s why at The Compass Group before we acquire any business we do much more than just look at the financials and perform our business due diligence.
We meet with the management team to see if the chemistry is right, because when all is said and done — we’re going to be partners. Sure we have the financial wherewithal to acquire the most unique niche market leaders in both industrial and branded consumer sectors.
But, we have much more than that: a long-term approach and commitment to working with the people who helped build your business.

Headquartered in East Bloomfield, NY, Crosman serves over 425 customers worldwide, including mass merchants, sporting goods retailers, online channels and distributors serving smaller specialty stores and international markets. The company's diversified product portfolio includes the widely known Crosman, Benjamin and CenterPoint brands. For the trailing twelve months ended April 30, 2017, Crosman reported net revenue of approximately $118 million

We are excited to draw on our past ownership of Crosman and deep experience with outdoor branded consumer product companies, and look forward to working with the company's strong management team to solidify Crosman's leading position in airguns and further penetrate the archery market." 
Mr. Offenberg added, "This transaction, our second platform acquisition in the last nine months, brings the current number of leading niche industrial and branded consumer businesses we own to nine. We expect the acquisition to provide approximately $0.12 per share of cash flow accretion to CODI on a full year basis. Moving ahead, we will continue to take advantage of our financial strength and liquidity to pursue attractive businesses with a reason to exist that will generate growing cash flows and further enhance our ability to provide sizeable cash distributions to our shareholders."
Additional information on the acquisition will be available on the Company's current report on Form 8-K that will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

        WESTPORT, Conn., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Compass Diversified Holdings (NYSE: CODI) ('CODI' or the 'Company'), an owner of leading middle market businesses, announced today that its subsidiary, Crosman Corporation ('Crosman'), has acquired the Commercial business of LaserMax, Inc. ('LaserMax'), a leading designer and manufacturer of gun mounted laser aiming devices.
      
      
        Since being founded in 1989, LaserMax has grown to become a global leader in hardened and miniaturized laser systems, offering a comprehensive line of premium laser sights for home defense, personal protection and training use. The company's Commercial business provides laser sighting solutions and tactical lights to the firearm OEM and retail channels. LaserMax has developed significant intellectual property in laser technology, resulting in a comprehensive IP portfolio. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2017, LaserMax reported net revenue of approximately $8 million. CODI funded the purchase price through a draw on its revolving credit facility.

        Alan Offenberg, CEO of CODI, stated, 'The addition of LaserMax's Commercial business supports Crosman's strategic initiative of expanding into attractive adjacent markets and realizing cross-selling opportunities with current big box retail and international customers. Further, adding this premium laser sight brand to Crosman's product offering in the outdoor recreation market will enable it to reach a wider range of new customers across retail channels. Moving forward, CODI will continue to use its strong balance sheet to pursue compelling add-on and platform acquisitions that build long-term shareholder value.'
      
      
        Robert Beckwith, CEO of Crosman, commented, 'LaserMax is well-known for its innovative laser products in the shooting sports accessory market, and the cross-selling synergies with Crosman's airgun and archery products are clear and highly attractive. With CODI's support, we are excited to be able to strengthen our product line for outdoor enthusiasts by adding this iconic brand to the Crosman portfolio.'
