WorkPlayToolsAboutContactJobsNewsHello, I’m David KelleyFounderI founded IDEO almost 30 years ago because I wanted to work in a creative environment surrounded by people I liked. These days, that’s still the case. I get to work with inspired people who have a commitment to making great things happen in the world. 
What you won't learn from my bio:  I was the bass player for a band called the Sabers in Barberton, Ohio.@kelleybrosView Full BioFull BioDavid Kelley is the founder and chairman of the global design and innovation company IDEO. Kelley also founded Stanford University’s Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, known as the d.school. As Stanford’s Donald W. Whittier Professor in Mechanical Engineering, Kelley is the Academic Director of both of the degree-granting undergraduate and graduate programs in Design within the School of Engineering, and has taught classes in the program for more than 35 years.
Kelley’s most enduring contributions are in human-centered design methodology and design thinking. He is most passionate about using design to help unlock creative confidence in everyone from students to business executives. A frequent speaker on these topics, Kelley and his brother co-authored the New York Times best-selling book Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All.
After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, Kelley worked as an engineer at both Boeing and NCR. Drawn to design, he entered Stanford University in 1975, where he earned his master’s degree in Engineering/Product Design. In 1978, he founded the design firm that would become IDEO and, in that same year, began his teaching career at Stanford, receiving tenure in 1990. He also founded an early-stage venture-capital firm in 1984 called Onset, and was instrumental in starting a special effects firm called Edge Innovations, which creates unique Animatronics for the film industry.
Kelley was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering in 2000. He holds honorary PhD's from both the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth and Art Center College in Pasadena. He has been recognized with numerous honors, including the Chrysler Design Award and the National Design Award in Product Design from the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, the Robert Fletcher Award from Dartmouth, and the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned him the Sir Misha Black Medal for his “distinguished contribution to design education.”Say Hello.San FranciscoLondonShanghaiChicagoNew YorkCambridgeMunichPalo AltoTokyoNetworkOpenIDEOIDEO UIDEO FuturesOI EngineIDEO CoLabIDEO.orgJobsCome work with us!

David Kelley’s company IDEO helped create many icons of the digital generation — but what matters even more to him is unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations to innovate routinely.

Why you should listen
As founder of legendary design firm IDEO, David Kelley built the  company that created many icons of the digital generation -- the first  mouse, the first Treo, the thumbs up/thumbs down button on your Tivo's  remote control, to name a few. But what matters even more to him is  unlocking the creative potential of people and organizations so they can  innovate routinely.David Kelley's most enduring contributions to  the field of design are a methodology and culture of innovation. More  recently, he led the creation of the groundbreaking d.school at  Stanford, the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design, where students from  the business, engineering, medicine, law, and other diverse disciplines  develop the capacity to solve complex problems collaboratively and  creatively.Kelley was working (unhappily) as an electrical  engineer when he heard about Stanford's cross-disciplinary Joint Program  in Design, which merged engineering and art. What he learned there -- a  human-centered, team-based approach to tackling sticky problems through  design -- propelled his professional life as a "design thinker."In  1978, he co-founded the design firm that ultimately became IDEO, now  emulated worldwide for its innovative, user-centered approach to design.  IDEO works with a range of clients -- from food and beverage  conglomerates to high tech startups, hospitals to universities, and  today even governments -- conceiving breakthrough innovations ranging  from a life-saving portable defibrillator to a new kind of residence for  wounded warriors, and helping organizations build their own innovation  culture.Today, David serves as chair of IDEO and is the Donald  W. Whittier Professor at Stanford, where he has taught for more than 25  years. Preparing the design thinkers of tomorrow earned David the Sir  Misha Black Medal for his “distinguished contribution to design  education.” He has also won the Edison Achievement Award for Innovation,  as well as the Chrysler Design Award and National Design Award in  Product Design from the Smithsonian’s Cooper-Hewitt National Design  Museum, and he is a member of the National Academy of Engineers.

Personal life[edit]
Kelley was born in Barberton, Ohio. His brother is Tom Kelley, the General Manager of IDEO and author of The Art of Innovation and The Ten Faces of Innovation. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in 1973, where he was a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, He is married to Katharine C. Branscomb, a former CEO of IntelliCorp, whom he met through mutual friend Steve Jobs.[3]
Work in industry[edit]
Kelley began work as an engineer, first at Boeing and later at NCR.[2] At Boeing, he was responsible for the design of the Lavatory Occupied sign for the 747 airplane.[4] This experience led him to return to school. In 1977, he earned his master's degree from the Joint Program in Design at Stanford University, popularly called the Product Design program.[5] In 1978, he partnered with another Stanford Product Design graduate, Dean Hovey, to form Hovey-Kelley Design. Hovey left to pursue other interests and the firm was renamed "David Kelley Design" (DKD).[6]
In 1984, he co-founded Onset Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm. He also co-founded Edge Innovations, the special-effects company responsible for the whales in the Free Willy movies, among many other film credits.[7] In 1991, Kelley merged DKD with three other design firms (Mike Nuttall's Matrix Product Design in Palo Alto, ID TWO in San Francisco, and Moggridge Associates in London, the latter two founded by Bill Moggridge) to create IDEO, which he ran as CEO until 2000. As chairman and managing partner, Kelley continues to play an active role at IDEO.
Work in education[edit]
Kelley began teaching in the Stanford Product Design program in 1978, after earning his master's. He was briefly a PhD student.[8] In 1990, he became a tenured professor, and was named the Donald W. Whittier Professor in Mechanical Engineering in 2002.[5] In 2004, Kelley led the creation of the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford University, known as the "d.school."[9]
Books, talks, and honors[edit]
David Kelley has been recognized as one of America's leading design innovators.
In 2013, David and his brother Tom Kelley published Creative Confidence,[10] which a Forbes review called "an empowering, compelling, relentlessly hopeful and optimistic read."[11]
In 2012, Kelley spoke on building creative confidence at TED 2012.[12] He had earlier spoken at TED 2002 on human-centered design.[13]
In 2009, he was awarded the Edison Achievement Award by the Thomas Edison Papers at Rutgers University for his “pioneering contributions to the design of breakthrough products, services, and experiences for consumers, as well as his development of an innovative culture that has broad impact.”[14]
In 2005, he was recognized for his "distinguished contribution to design education" with the Sir Misha Black Medal.[15]
In 2001, the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum presented David Kelley and IDEO with the National Design Award in Product Design.[16]
In 2000, he was honored with a Chrysler Design Award, [17] and was elected to the National Academy of Engineering for "affecting the practice of design."[2]

Review
Broken Voyage is Kelly David's debut CD. It might just be the strongest debut CD ever, regardless of genre. -- Jim BrenholtsDavid's work has an effect on the imagination that is almost catalytic. -- Chuck van Zyl/STAR'S ENDEvery track attacks the audience with the remorseless ferocity of an unlicensed teen driving on wet pavement. -- Max Cady  (SC Capital Case No. 91-0405-07),  New music reviewer for the Pee Dee County Correctional Facility Newsletter,Make no mistake: this is a quite a firm one for ambientlovers, but the journey holds a reward... -- Bert Strolenberg KLEM Magazine The Netherlands

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsHighly spectacular and adventurous sea expedition!!!ByRichard Gurtleron January 4, 2012Format: Audio CDDebut album of Kelly David, Colorado based sound journeyer is dated back to 2002 and released on his own Rocky Mountain Records. "Broken Voyage" is initiated with 17-minute overture entitled "Off The Map" and sculpted by highly attractive industrial elements, Mors codes, strange voice samples, field recordings... and drones, all wrapped in richly colored and freshly effective alterations and movements. Sailing through various territories, ranging from atmospheric industrial through rhythm-infused to ultra deep droning. An amazing start of this spectacular sea expedition! "Coastwatcher" is observed though deep misty sceneries by cavernous heavy drone mastery enriched with diverse beaconing environmental sounds. Another superb piece! Dense drones overlap to the next composition, a 22-plus minutes long opus "Shadow Side" featuring as guests Steve Roach (electro groove) and Kailani Yaksich (hand percussion). Soon we hear invading echoed primal rumbling sounds welcoming us in deeply mysterious realms. Later we are shifted into trancey groove heavy beats sounding like a speedy train roaring down the tracks. But around 13th minute the texture glides into slightly peaceful floating structure colored with industrial rumblings and gurglings, transmission voices and trancey grooves hidden on the background. But always extensively textured and effectively intense. Certainly another masterful performance!!! "Buka Passage", again with both above guests in action, is flavored with strong organics where softly tinkling bells and aerial washes become at times more massive. Gently colorful and extremely tranquil soundscaping! Highly mesmerizing trancey cyber grooves fragrance the following piece, "Cargo Cult", presenting a new guest, Michael Brugman on guitar. Again moving across diverse passages, from minimal pulses and beats through more dramatic and massive to experimentally eclectic funky-charged ventures with buzzing electric guitar. Kelly David at his most adventurous and weird!!! "Coastwatcher Reprise" is wrapped in celestial atmosonics and enriched by gradually spiraling dramatic passages, a fine outro! I don't know how much praised was this album after its release by the audience, but I feel this amazingly distinguished work showcasing tremendous talent and potential of its creator still remains unexplored. Undeservingly!!! Only two albums are on Kelly David's credit, but both of them are top-notch, this guy definitely deserves much more attention!!! As a bonus you get with "Broken Voyage" top sound quality, mixing by Steve Roach and mastering by Roger King, and stunningly looking artwork designed by Sam Rosenthal. "Broken Voyage" is without any doubt a hidden treasure!!! And just the same as with Kelly David's second "Angkor" album, I still keep on dreaming about his next sonic wizardry...Richard Gürtler (Jan 04, 2012, Bratislava, Slovakia)Read more11 comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA Journey of Images and EmotionsByMichael Hugoson February 8, 2003Format: Audio CDKelly David is masterful in the way that his music evokes a sense of place. The first piece on the CD, "Off the Map" provides the setting for the pieces that follow. One hears what could be explosions in the distance. The sound of a hurried passage through dense jungle, and a feeling of panic. Then sounds that seem like the dots and dashes of Morse code heard faintly through a radio headset. Again, off in the distance and coming closer, is what could be the chugging of an engine. It brings to mind a boat moving along the coast, looking for someone.The names of the pieces that follow such as, "Coastwatcher", "Shadow Side", and "Buka Passage", remind me of the story of the Austrailian coastwatchers in the Solomon Islands of the South Pacific during World War II. The coastwatchers lived and hid in the jungle as the Japanese invaded the islands and radioed back information on the movement of troops, ships, and planes. They had to keep moving to avoid capture. I have often wondered what kind of mental and emotional journey that experience would create.Each piece explores a different facet of that journey. In "Coastwatcher" there is a feeling of calm and an awareness of the the landscape that surrounds you. This awareness leads to a meditative serenity. "Shadow Side" explores how that feeling of serenity is invaded by unseen fears. There is the ebb and flow of imagery that goes from peaceful to ominous and back again. In "Buka Passage" one gets the feeling of looking out across a panorama of islands, and water, and sunlight. One hears the rhythmic sound of what could be waves washing on the shore. In the piece, "Cargo Cult" the mood builds to become almost festive and then fades away again.I highly recommend this CD. It is the beginning of what I hope will be a long and productive journey for Kelly David. I look forward to his next work.Read more0Comment|

Reclaim Your Creative Confidence
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

Kelley, T., Kelley, D.

2012; 90 (12): 115-?


Abstract
Most people are born creative. But over time, a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses. We become warier of judgment, more cautious more analytical. The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of IDEO, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another. Creativity is something you practice, say the authors, not just a talent you are born with.

Reclaim Your Creative Confidence
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW

Kelley, T., Kelley, D.

2012; 90 (12): 115-?


Abstract
Most people are born creative. But over time, a lot of us learn to stifle those impulses. We become warier of judgment, more cautious more analytical. The world seems to divide into "creatives" and "noncreatives," and too many people resign themselves to the latter category. And yet we know that creativity is essential to success in any discipline or industry. The good news, according to authors Tom Kelley and David Kelley of IDEO, is that we all can rediscover our creative confidence. The trick is to overcome the four big fears that hold most of us back: fear of the messy unknown, fear of judgment, fear of the first step, and fear of losing control. The authors use an approach based on the work of psychologist Albert Bandura in helping patients get over their snake phobias: You break challenges down into small steps and then build confidence by succeeding on one after another. Creativity is something you practice, say the authors, not just a talent you are born with.
