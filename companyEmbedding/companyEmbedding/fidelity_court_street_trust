FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.

          1. Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios apply tax-sensitive investment management techniques (including tax-loss harvesting) on a limited basis, at their discretion, primarily with respect to determining when assets in a client’s account should be bought or sold. With this discretionary investment management service, any assets contributed to an investor’s account that Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios do not elect to retain may be sold at any time after contribution. An investor may have a gain or loss when assets are sold.
	
    

          2.
	
	
	       
					Please note that you will be charged an additional fee for any SMAs held in your account. These fees are in addition to the basic advisory fees for Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios. Please refer to your Client Agreement for detailed fee information.


          3. The advisory fee does not cover charges resulting from trades effected with or through broker-dealers other than affiliates of Strategic Advisers, mark-ups or mark-downs by broker-dealers, transfer taxes, exchange fees, regulatory fees, odd-lot differentials, handling charges, electronic fund and wire transfer fees, or any other charges imposed by law or otherwise applicable to your account. You will also incur underlying expenses associated with the investment vehicles selected.
	
    

          4. Fidelity Personal Trust refers to trust services that are offered through Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB (FPTC), a federal savings bank.
	
    

Keep in mind that investing involves risk. The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money.

			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

FIDELITY COURT STREET TRUST II - DEF 14A - 19971020 - PROXY_STATEMENT





PROXY STATEMENT

SPECIAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS OF

FIDELITY COURT STREET TRUST II:


FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
SPARTAN CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
SPARTAN FLORIDA MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
TO BE HELD ON DECEMBER 17, 1997


This Proxy Statement is furnished in connection with a solicitation
of proxies made by, and on behalf of, the Board of Trustees of
Fidelity Court Street Trust II (the trust) to be used at the Special
Meeting of Shareholders of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market
Fund, Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan Florida
Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money
Market Fund (the funds) and at any adjournments thereof (the Meeting),
to be held on December 17, 1997 at 12:00 p.m. at 82 Devonshire Street,
Boston, Massachusetts 02109, the principal executive office of the
trust and Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR), the funds'
investment adviser.

The purpose of the Meeting is set forth in the accompanying Notice.
The solicitation is made primarily by the mailing of this Proxy
Statement and the accompanying proxy card on or about October 20,
1997. Supplementary solicitations may be made by mail, telephone,
telegraph, facsimile,    electronic m    eans, or by personal
interview by representatives of the trust. In addition, Management
Information Services Corp. (MIS) and D.F. King & Co. may be paid on a
per-call basis to solicit shareholders on behalf of the funds at an
anticipated cost of approximately $6,000 (Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund), $3,000 (Spartan Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund), $4,000 (Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market
Fund), and $7,000 (Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund),
respectively. The expenses in connection with preparing this Proxy
Statement and its enclosures and of all solicitations will be paid by
the funds (except for Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund
and Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund, whose expenses will
be borne by FMR). The funds (FMR for Spartan Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund and Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund)
will reimburse brokerage firms and others for their reasonable
expenses in forwarding solicitation material to the beneficial owners
of shares. The principal business address of Fidelity Distributors
Corporation (FDC) the funds' principal underwriter and distribution
agent is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. The
principal business address of FMR Texas, Inc. (FMR Texas), subadviser
to the funds, is 400 East Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039.

If the enclosed proxy card is executed and returned, it may
nevertheless be revoked at any time prior to its use by written
notification received by the trust, by the execution of a later-dated
proxy card, or by attending the Meeting and voting in person.

All proxy cards solicited by the Board of Trustees that are properly
executed and received by the Secretary prior to the Meeting, and which
are not revoked, will be voted at the Meeting. Shares represented by
such proxies will be voted in accordance with the instructions
thereon. If no specification is made on a proxy card, it will be voted
FOR the matters specified on the proxy card. Only proxies that are
voted will be counted towards establishing a quorum. Broker non-votes
are not considered voted for this purpose. Shareholders should note
that while votes to ABSTAIN will count toward establishing a quorum,
passage of any proposal being considered at the Meeting will occur
only if a sufficient number of votes are cast FOR the proposal.
Accordingly, votes to ABSTAIN and votes AGAINST will have the same
effect in determining whether the proposal is approved.

The funds may also arrange to have votes recorded by telephone. D.F.
King & Co. may be paid on a per call basis for vote-by-phone
solicitations on behalf of the funds at an anticipated cost of
approximately $5,000, (Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market
Fund), $2,000 (Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund),
$3,000 (Spartan Florida Municipal Money Market Fund) and $6,000
(Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund). The expenses in
connection with telephone voting will be paid by the funds (except for
Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Spartan Florida
Municipal Money Market Fund, whose expenses will be borne by FMR). If
the funds record votes by telephone, they will use procedures designed
to authenticate shareholders' identities, to allow shareholders to
authorize the voting of their shares in accordance with their
instructions, and to confirm that their instructions have been
properly recorded. Proxies voted by telephone may be revoked at any
time before they are voted in the same manner that proxies voted by
mail may be revoked.

If a quorum is not present at the Meeting, or if a quorum is present
at the Meeting, but sufficient votes to approve one or more of the
proposed items are not received, or if other matters arise requiring
shareholder attention, the persons named as proxy agents may propose
one or more adjournments of the Meeting to permit further solicitation
of proxies. Any such adjournment will require the affirmative vote of
a majority of those shares present at the Meeting or represented by
proxy. When voting on a proposed adjournment, the persons named as
proxy agents will vote FOR the proposed adjournment all shares that
they are entitled to vote with respect to each item, unless directed
to vote AGAINST the item, in which case such shares will be voted
AGAINST the proposed adjournment with respect to that item. A
shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the items in this
Proxy Statement prior to such adjournment if sufficient votes have
been received and it is otherwise appropriate.

remaining Trustees will fill such vacancy by appointing another
Trustee, so long as, immediately after such appointment, at least
two-thirds of the Trustees have been elected by shareholders. If, at
any time, less than a majority of the Trustees holding office has been
elected by the shareholders, the Trustees then in office will promptly
call a shareholders' meeting for the purpose of electing a Board of
Trustees. Otherwise, there will normally be no meeting of shareholders
for the purpose of electing Trustees.

The trust's Board, which is currently composed of two interested and
seven non-interested Trustees, met eleven times during the twelve
months ended November 30, 1996. It is expected that the Trustees will
meet at least ten times a year at regularly scheduled meetings.

The trust's Audit Committee is composed entirely of Trustees who are
not interested persons of the trust, FMR or its affiliates and
normally meets four times a year, or as required, prior to meetings of
the Board of Trustees. Currently, Mr. Kirk (Chairman) and Mrs. Davis
are members of the Committee. If elected, it is anticipated that Mr.
McCoy and Mr. Gates will be members of the committee. The committee
oversees and monitors the trust's internal control structure, its
auditing function and its financial reporting process, including the
resolution of material reporting issues. The committee recommends to
the Board of Trustees the appointment of auditors for the trust. It
reviews audit plans, fees and other material arrangements in respect
of the engagement of auditors, including non-audit services to be
performed. It reviews the qualifications of key personnel involved in
the foregoing activities. The committee plays an oversight role in
respect of the trust's investment compliance procedures and the code
of ethics. During the twelve months ended November 30, 1996, the
committee held four meetings.

The trust's Nominating and Administration Committee is currently
composed of Messrs. McDonough (Chairman), Jones and Williams. The
committee members confer periodically and hold meetings as required.
The committee makes nominations for independent trustees, and for
membership on committees. The committee periodically reviews
procedures and policies of the Board of Trustees and committees. It
acts as the administrative committee under the Retirement Plan for
non-interested trustees who retired prior to December 30, 1996. It
monitors the performance of legal counsel employed by the trust and
the independent trustees. The committee in the first instance monitors
compliance with, and acts as the administrator of the provisions of
the code of ethics applicable to the independent trustees. During the
twelve months ended November 30, 1996, the committee held four
meetings. The Nominating and Administration Committee will consider
nominees recommended by shareholders. Recommendations should be
submitted to the committee in care of the Secretary of the Trust. The
trust does not have a compensation committee; such matters are
considered by the Nominating and Administration Committee.

The following table sets forth information describing the estimated
compensation of each Trustee and Member of the Advisory Board of each
fund for his or her services for the fiscal year ended November 30,
1997 or calendar year ended December 31, 1996, as applicable.

Under a retirement program adopted in July 1988 and modified in
November 1995 and November 1996, each non-interested Trustee who
retired before December 30, 1996 may receive payments from a Fidelity
fund during his or her lifetime based on his or her basic trustee fees
and length of service. The obligation of a fund to make such payments
is neither secured nor funded. A Trustee became eligible to
participate in the program at the end of the calendar year in which he
or she reached age 72, provided that, at the time of retirement, he or
she had served as a Fidelity fund Trustee for at least five years.

Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and
amended in November 1996 (the Plan), non-interested Trustees must
defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an
additional portion of, their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the
Plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested
in shares of a cross-section of Fidelity funds including funds in each
major investment discipline and representing a majority of Fidelity's
assets under management (the Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately
received by the Trustees under the Plan will be directly linked to the
investment performance of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in
accordance with the Plan will have a negligible effect on a fund's
assets, liabilities, and net income per share, and will not obligate a
fund to retain the services of any Trustee or to pay any particular
level of compensation to the Trustee. A fund may invest in the
Reference Funds under the Plan without shareholder approval.

As of December 30, 1996, the non-interested Trustees terminated the
retirement program for Trustees who retire after such date. In
connection with the termination of the retirement program, each
then-existing non-interested Trustee received a credit to his or her
Plan account equal to the present value of the estimated benefits that
would have been payable under the retirement program. The amounts
credited to the non-interested Trustees' Plan accounts are subject to
vesting and are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been
invested in shares of the Reference Funds. The amounts ultimately
received by the Trustees in connection with the credits to their Plan
accounts will be directly linked to the investment performance of the
Reference Funds. The termination of the retirement program and related
crediting of estimated benefits to the Trustees' Plan accounts did not
result in a material cost to the funds.

2. TO RATIFY THE SELECTION OF COOPERS & LYBRAND L.L.P. AS INDEPENDENT
ACCOUNTANTS OF THE TRUST.
By a vote of the non-interested Trustees, the firm of Coopers &
Lybrand L.L.P. has been selected as independent accountants for
each fund     to sign or certify any financial statements of
each fund     required by any law or regulation to be certified by
an independent accountant and filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) or any state. Pursuant to the 1940 Act, such
selection requires the ratification of shareholders. In addition, as
required by the 1940 Act, the vote of the Trustees is subject to the
right of e   ach fund    , by vote of a majority of its outstanding
voting securities at any meeting called for the purpose of voting on
such action, to terminate such employment without penalty. Coopers &
Lybrand L.L.P. has advised e   ach fun    d that it has no direct or
material indirect ownership interest in e   ach     fund.
The independent accountants examine annual financial statements for
the funds and provide other audit and tax-related services. In
recommending the selection of the funds   '     accountants, the Audit
Committee reviewed the nature and scope of the services to be provided
(including non-audit services) and whether the performance of such
services would affect the accountants' independence. Representatives
of Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. are not expected to be present at the
Meeting, but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if
they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring
their presence.

On September 18, 1997 Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. and Price
Waterhouse LLP announced plans to merge their practices world wide.
Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. and Price Waterhouse LLP expect the merger,
which is subject to approval by the partners of both organizations and
by the regulators, to become effective in early 1998.

3. TO AMEND THE TRUST INSTRUMENT TO PROVIDE DOLLAR-BASED VOTING RIGHTS
FOR SHAREHOLDERS OF THE TRUST.
The Board of Trustees has approved, and recommends that shareholders
of the trust approve a proposal to amend Article VII, Section 7.01 of
the Trust Instrument. The amendment would provide voting rights based
on a shareholder's total dollar interest in a fund (dollar-based
voting), rather than on the number of shares owned, for all
shareholder votes for a fund. As a result, voting power would be
allocated in proportion to the value of each shareholder's investment.

BACKGROUND. Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, Spartan Florida Municipal
Money Market Fund, and New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund are
funds of Fidelity Court Street Trust II, an open-end management
investment company organized as a Delaware business trust. Currently,
there are four funds in the trust. Shareholders of each fund vote
separately on matters concerning only that fund and vote on a
trust-wide basis on matters that affect the trust as a whole, such as
electing trustees or amending the Trust Instrument. Currently, under
the Trust Instrument, each share is entitled to one vote, regardless
of the relative value of the shares of each fund in the trust.

The original intent of the one-share, one-vote provision was to
provide equitable voting rights to all shareholders as required by the
1940 Act. In the case where a trust has several series or funds, such
as Fidelity Court Street Trust II, voting rights may have become
disproportionate since the net asset value per share (NAV) of the
separate funds generally diverge over time. The Staff of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has issued a "no-action"
letter permitting a trust to seek shareholder approval of a
dollar-based voting system. The proposed amendment will comply with
the conditions stated in the no-action letter.

REASON FOR PROPOSAL. If approved, the amendment would provide a more
equitable distribution of voting rights for certain votes than the
one-share, one-vote system currently in effect. The voting power of
each shareholder would be commensurate with the value of the
shareholder's dollar investment rather than with the number of shares
held.

Under the current voting provisions, an investment in a fund with a
lower NAV may have significantly greater voting power than the same
dollar amount invested in a fund with a higher NAV. Currently, since
there are only money market funds in the trust, the proposal will not
affect the voting rights of fund shareholders on votes requiring
trust-wide participation since money market funds are managed to
maintain a $1.00 NAV. However, if additional funds with fluctuating
NAVs are added to the trust, relative voting rights would be changed
under the proposal. To illustrate the potentially disproportionate
calculation of voting power currently in place, the table below shows
a hypothetical example of a trust with funds with fluctuating NAVs.








FUND   NET ASSET VALUE   $1,000 INVESTMENT
                         IN TERMS OF
                         NUMBER OF SHARES

A      $ 10.00            100.000

B      $ 7.57             132.100

C      $ 10.93            91.491

D      $ 1.00             1,000.000








For example, Fund D shareholders would have ten times the voting
power of Fund A shareholders, because a $1,000 investment in Fund D
would buy ten times as many shares as a $1,000 investment in Fund A.
Accordingly, a one-share, one-vote system may provide certain
shareholders with a disproportionate ability to affect the vote
relative to shareholders of other funds in the trust. If dollar-based
voting had been in effect, each shareholder would have had 1,000
voting shares. Their voting power would be proportionate to their
economic interest, which FMR believes is a more equitable result, and
which is the result with respect to a typical corporation where each
voting share generally has an equal market price.

On matters requiring trust-wide votes where all funds are required to
vote, shareholders who own shares with a lower NAV than other funds in
the trust would be giving other shareholders in the trust more voting
"power" than they currently have. On matters affecting only one fund,
only shareholders of that fund vote on the issue. In this instance,
under both the current Trust Instrument and an amended Trust
Instrument, all shareholders of the fund would have the same voting
rights, since the NAV is the same for all shares in a single fund.

AMENDMENT TO THE TRUST        INSTRUMENT. Article VII, Section 7.01
sets forth the method of calculating voting rights for all shareholder
votes for the trust. If approved, Article VII, Section 7.01 will be
amended as follows (material to be added is
((    underlined   ))     and material to be deleted is [bracketed]):


ARTICLE VII

SHAREHOLDERS' VOTING POWERS AND MEETINGS VOTING POWERS


Section 7.01 The    S    hareholders shall have power to vote . . .
On any matter submitted to a vote of the Shareholders, all Shares
shall be voted separately by individual Series, except (i) when
required by the 1940 Act, Shares shall be voted in the aggregate and
not by individual Series; and (ii) when the Trustees have determined
that the matter affects the interests of more than one Series, then
the Shareholders of all such Series shall be entitled to vote thereon.
The Trustees may also determine that a matter affects only the
interests of one or more classes of a Series, in which case any such
matters shall be voted on by such class or classes. [Each whole Share
shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled
to vote, and each fractional Share shall be entitled to a
proportionate fractional vote.]    ((    A Shareholder of each Series
shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value
(number of shares owned times net asset value per share) of such
Series, on any matter on which such Shareholder is entitled to vote
and each fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate
fractional vote.   ))     There shall be no cumulative voting in the
election of Trustees. Shares may be voted in person or by proxy, or in
any manner provided for in the Bylaws. A proxy may be given in
writing. The Bylaws may provide that proxies may also, or may instead,
be given by any electronic or telecommunications device or in any
other manner. Notwithstanding anything else herein or in the Bylaws,
in the event a proposal by anyone other than the officers or Trustees
of the Trust is submitted to a vote of the Shareholders of one or more
Series or of the Trust, or in the event of any proxy contest or proxy
solicitation or proposal in opposition to any proposal by the officers
or Trustees of the Trust, Shares may be voted only in person or by
written proxy. Until Shares are issued, the Trustees may exercise all
rights of Shareholders and may take any action required or permitted
by law, this Trust Instrument or any Bylaws of the Trust to be taken
by Shareholders.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit the trust and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. The amended Trust Instrument will become
effective upon shareholder approval. If the proposal is not approved
by shareholders of the trust, Article VII, Section 7.01 of the Trust
Instrument will remain unchanged.

4. TO APPROVE AN AMENDED MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT
MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND.
The Board of Trustees, including the Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the Trust or of FMR (the Independent Trustees) has
approved, and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a
proposal to adopt an amended management contract with Fidelity
Management & Research Company (FMR) (the Amended Contract). The
Amended Contract modifies the management fee that FMR receives from
the fund to provide for lower fees when FMR's assets under management
exceed certain levels. THE AMENDED CONTRACT WILL RESULT IN A
MANAGEMENT FEE THAT IS THE SAME AS, OR LOWER THAN, THE FEE PAYABLE
UNDER THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT (THE PRESENT CONTRACT).

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT. A copy of the
Amended Contract, marked to indicate the proposed amendments, is
supplied as Exhibit 1 on page        . Except for the modifications
discussed above, it is substantially identical to the Present
Contract. (For a detailed discussion of the fund's Present Contract,
refer to the section entitled "Present Management Contracts" beginning
on page        .) If approved by shareholders, the Amended Contract
will take effect on January 1, 1998 (or, if later, the first day of
the first month following approval) and will remain in effect through
May 31, 1998 and thereafter, but only as long as its continuance is
approved at least annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a
meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of those Trustees who
are not "interested persons" of the trust or FMR (the Independent
Trustees) and (ii) the vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by
the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund. If the
Amended Contract is not approved, the Present Contract will continue
in effect through May 31, 1998, and thereafter only as long as its
continuance is approved at least annually by (i) the vote, cast in
person at a meeting called for the purpose, of a majority of the
Independent Trustees and (ii) the vote of either a majority of the
Trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the
fund.

The management fee is an annual percentage of the fund's average net
assets (the management fee rate), calculated and paid monthly. The
management fee rate is the sum of two components: a Group Fee Rate,
which varies according to assets under management by FMR, and a fixed
Individual Fund Fee Rate. The Amended Contract modifies the Group Fee
Rate by providing for lower fee rates if FMR's assets under management
remain above $120 billion.

MODIFICATION TO GROUP FEE RATE. The Group Fee Rate varies based upon
the monthly average of the aggregate net assets of all registered
investment companies having management contracts with FMR (assets
under management by FMR). For example, as assets under management by
FMR increase, the Group Fee Rate declines. The Amended Contract would
not change the group fee calculation for assets under management by
FMR of $120 billion or less. Above $120 billion in assets under FMR's
management, the Group Fee Rate declines under both the Present
Contract and the Amended Contract, but under the Amended Contract, it
declines faster. Group Fee Rates that are lower than those contained
in the fund's Present Contract have been voluntarily implemented by
FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994, and January
1, 1996.

The Group Fee Rate is calculated according to a graduated schedule
providing for different rates for different levels of assets under
management by FMR. The rate at which the Group Fee Rate declines is
determined by fee "breakpoints" that provide for lower fee rates when
assets increase. The Amended Contract adds 12 new fee breakpoints for
assets under FMR's management above $120 billion as illustrated in the
following table. (For an explanation of how the Group Fee Rate is used
to calculate the management fee, see the section entitled "Present
Management Contracts" beginning on page        .)

COMPARISON OF MANAGEMENT FEES. For August 31, 1997, average assets
under management by FMR were $531 billion. The fund's management fee
rate under the Amended Contract would have been .3882%, compared to
.4069% under the Present Contract. The management fee rate will remain
the same under both the Present Contract and the Amended Contract
until assets under FMR's management exceed $120 billion, at which
point the management fee rate under the Amended Contract begins to
decline relative to the Present Contract. The following chart compares
the fund's management fee under the terms of the Present Contract for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 to the management fee the fund

MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD

The mutual funds for which the members of the Board of Trustees serve
as Trustees are referred to herein as the "Fidelity funds." The Board
of Trustees meets eleven times a year. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, believe that matters bearing on
the appropriateness of the fund's management fees are considered at
most, if not all, of their meetings. While the full Board of Trustees
or the Independent Trustees, as appropriate, act on all major matters,
a significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees
(including certain of those described herein) are conducted through
committees. The Independent Trustees meet frequently in executive
session and are advised by independent legal counsel selected by the
Independent Trustees.

The proposal to present the Amended Contract to shareholders was
approved by the Board of Trustees of the fund, including the
Independent Trustees on October 17, 1996. The Board of Trustees
considered and approved the modifications to the Group Fee Rate
schedule during the two month periods from November to December 1995,
June to July 1994, September to October 1993, and November to December
1991. The Board of Trustees received materials relating to the Amended
Contract in advance of the meeting at which the Amended Contract was
considered, and had the opportunity to ask questions and request
further information in connection with such consideration.

INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. In connection with
their monthly meetings Trustees receive materials specifically
relating to the Amended Contract. These materials include: (i)
information on the investment performance of the fund, a peer group of
funds and an appropriate index or combination of indices, (ii) sales
and redemption data in respect of the fund, (iii) the economic outlook
and the general investment outlook in the markets in which the fund
invests, and (iv) notable changes in the fund's investments. The Board
of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also consider periodically
other material facts such as (1) FMR's results and financial
condition, (2) arrangements in respect of the distribution of the
fund's shares, (3) the procedures employed to determine the value of
the fund's assets, (4) the allocation of the fund's brokerage, if any,
including allocations to brokers affiliated with FMR (5) FMR's
management of the relationships with the fund's custodian and
subcustodians, (6) the resources devoted to and the record of
compliance with the fund's investment policies and restrictions and
with policies on personal securities transactions, and (7) the nature,
cost and quality of non-investment management services provided by FMR
and its affiliates.

In response to questions raised by the Independent Trustees,
additional information was furnished by FMR including, among other
items, information on and analysis of (a) the overall organization of
FMR, (b) the choice of performance indices and benchmarks, (c) the
composition of peer groups of funds, (d) transfer agency and
bookkeeping fees paid to affiliates of FMR, (e) investment
performance, (f) investment management staffing, (g) the potential for
achieving further economies of scale, (h) operating expenses paid to
third parties, and (i) the information furnished to investors,
including the fund's shareholders.

In considering the Amended Contract, the Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees did not identify any single factor as
all-important or controlling, and the following summary does not
detail all the matters considered. Matters considered by the Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees in connection with their
approval of the Amended Contract include the following:

INVESTMENT COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered whether the fund has operated within
its investment objective and its record of compliance with its
investment restrictions. They also reviewed monthly the fund's
investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group of
mutual funds, and the performance of an appropriate index or
combination of indices.

FMR'S PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees annually review a report detailing the background
of the fund's portfolio manager, and the fund's investment objective
and discipline. The Independent Trustees have also had discussions
with senior management of FMR responsible for investment operations,
and the senior management of Fidelity's money market group. Among
other things they considered the size, education and experience of
FMR's investment staff, its use of technology, and FMR's approach to
recruiting, training and retaining portfolio managers and other
research, advisory and management personnel.

NATURE AND QUALITY OF OTHER SERVICES. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the nature, quality, cost and extent
of administrative and shareholder services performed by FMR and
affiliated companies, both under the Amended Contract and under
separate agreements covering transfer agency functions and pricing,
bookkeeping and securities lending services, if any. The Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees have also considered the nature
and extent of FMR's supervision of third party service providers,
principally custodians and subcustodians.

EXPENSES. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the fund's expense ratio and expense ratios of a peer group
of funds. They also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by
shareholders.

PROFITABILITY. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the level of FMR's profits in respect of the management of
the Fidelity funds, including the fund. This consideration included an
extensive review of FMR's methodology in allocating its costs to the
management of the fund. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees have concluded that the cost allocation methodology employed
by FMR has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of
the circumstances. They considered the profits realized by FMR in
connection with the operation of the fund and whether the amount of
profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the
fund. They also considered the profits realized from non-fund
businesses which may benefit from or be related to the fund's
business. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also
considered FMR's profit margins in comparison with available industry
data, both accounting for and ignoring marketing expenses.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees considered whether there have been economies of scale in
respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, whether the Fidelity
funds (including the fund) have appropriately benefitted from any
economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of
any further economies of scale. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees have concluded that FMR's mutual fund business
presents some limited opportunities to realize economies of scale and
that these economies are being shared between fund shareholders and
FMR in an appropriate manner. The Independent Trustees have also
concluded that the existing group fee structure should be continued
but determined that it would be appropriate to change the group fee
structure as proposed herein.

OTHER BENEFITS TO FMR. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
fund and the fund's shareholders for services provided by FMR and its
affiliates, including fees for services like transfer agency, fund
accounting and direct shareholder services. They also considered the
allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with FMR and the
receipt of sales loads and payments under Rule 12b-1 plans in respect
of certain of the Fidelity funds. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees also considered the revenues and profitability of
FMR businesses other than its mutual fund business, including FMR's
retail brokerage, correspondent brokerage, capital markets, trust,
investment advisory, pension record keeping, credit card, insurance,
publishing, real estate, international research and investment funds,
and others. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the intangible benefits that accrue to FMR and its
affiliates by virtue of their relationship with the fund.

OTHER BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of
investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a
variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of
fund and shareholder services.

CONCLUSION. Based on their evaluation of all material factors and
assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the Trustees concluded

(i) that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable
and (ii) that the proposed modifications to the management fee
structure, that is the reduction of the Group Fee Rate schedule are in
the best interest of the fund's shareholders. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, voted to approve the submission of
the Amended Contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that
shareholders of the fund vote FOR the Amended Contract.

5. TO APPROVE AN AMENDED MANAGEMENT CONTRACT FOR FIDELITY NEW JERSEY
MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND.
The Board of Trustees, including the Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the Trust or of FMR (the Independent Trustees), has
approved, and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a
proposal to adopt an amended management contract with Fidelity
Management & Research Company (FMR) (the Amended Contract). The
Amended Contract modifies the management fee that FMR receives from
the fund to provide for lower fees when FMR's assets under management
exceed certain levels. The Amended Contract also includes a discussion
of FMR's ability to use brokers and dealers to execute portfolio
transactions. THE AMENDED CONTRACT WILL RESULT IN A MANAGEMENT FEE/
THAT IS THE SAME AS, OR LOWER THAN, THE FEE PAYABLE UNDER THE PRESENT
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT (THE PRESENT CONTRACT).

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACT. A copy of the
Amended Contract, marked to indicate the proposed amendments, is
supplied as Exhibit 2 on page . Except for the modifications discussed
above, it is substantially identical to the Present Contract. (For a
detailed discussion of the fund's Present Contract, refer to the
section entitled "Present Management Contracts" beginning on page .)
If approved by shareholders, the Amended Contract will take effect on
January 1, 1998 (or, if later, the first day of the first month
following approval) and will remain in effect through May 31, 1998 and
thereafter, but only as long as its continuance is approved at least
annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for the
purpose, of a majority of those Trustees who are not "interested
persons" of the trust or FMR (the Independent Trustees) and (ii) the
vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the fund. If the Amended Contract is not
approved, the Present Contract will continue in effect through May 31,
1998, and thereafter only as long as its continuance is approved at
least annually by (i) the vote, cast in person at a meeting called for
the purpose, of a majority of the Independent Trustees and (ii) the
vote of either a majority of the Trustees or by the vote of a majority
of the outstanding shares of the fund.

The management fee is an annual percentage of the fund's average net
assets (the management fee rate), calculated and paid monthly. The
management fee rate is the sum of two components: a Group Fee Rate,
which varies according to assets under management by FMR, and a fixed
Individual Fund Fee Rate. The Amended Contract modifies the Group Fee
Rate by providing for lower fee rates if FMR's assets under management
remain above $120 billion.

MODIFICATION TO GROUP FEE RATE. The Group Fee Rate varies based upon
the monthly average of the aggregate net assets of all registered
investment companies having management contracts with FMR (assets
under management by FMR). For example, as assets under management by
FMR increase, the Group Fee Rate declines. The Amended Contract would
not change the group fee calculation for assets under management by
FMR of $120 billion or less. Above $120 billion in assets under FMR's
management, the Group Fee Rate declines under both the Present
Contract and the Amended Contract, but under the Amended Contract, it
declines faster. Group Fee Rates that are lower than those contained
in the fund's Present Contract have been voluntarily implemented by
FMR on January 1, 1992, November 1, 1993, August 1, 1994, and January
1, 1996.

The Group Fee Rate is calculated according to a graduated schedule
providing for different rates for different levels of assets under
management by FMR. The rate at which the Group Fee Rate declines is
determined by fee "breakpoints" that provide for lower fee rates when
assets increase. The Amended Contract adds 12 new fee breakpoints for
assets under FMR's management above $120 billion as illustrated in the
following table. (For an explanation of how the Group Fee Rate is used
to calculate the management fee, see the section entitled "Present
Management Contracts" beginning on page        .)

and January 1, 1996.
Assets under FMR's management for August 31, 1997 were approximately
$531 billion.
COMPARISON OF MANAGEMENT FEES. For August 31, 1997 average assets
under management by FMR were $531 billion. The fund's management fee
rate under the Amended Contract would have been .3882%, compared to
.4069% under the Present Contract. The management fee rate will remain
the same under both the Present Contract and the Amended Contract
until assets under FMR's management exceed $120 billion, at which
point the management fee rate under the Amended Contract begins to
decline relative to the Present Contract. The following chart compares
the fund's management fee under the terms of the Present Contract for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 to the management fee the fund
would have incurred if the Amended Contract had been in effect.

TRANSACTIONS WITH BROKERS-DEALERS. The fund may execute portfolio
transactions with broker-dealers who provide research and execution
services to the fund or other accounts over which FMR or its
affiliates exercise investment discretion. The selection of such
broker-dealers is generally made by FMR (to the extent possible
consistent with execution considerations) in accordance with a ranking
of broker-dealers determined periodically by FMR's investment staff
based upon the quality of research and execution services provided. If
FMR grants investment management authority to a sub-adviser pursuant
to a Sub-advisory Agreement, the sub-adviser is authorized to place
orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities, and will do
so in accordance with the policies described below.
The receipt of research from broker-dealers that execute transactions
on behalf of the fund may be useful to FMR in rendering investment
management services to the fund and to its other clients, and
conversely, such research provided by broker-dealers who execute
transaction orders on behalf of other FMR clients may be useful to FMR
in carrying out its obligations to the fund. The receipt of such
research has not reduced FMR's normal independent research activities;
however, it enables FMR to avoid additional expenses that could be
incurred if FMR tried to develop comparable information through its
own efforts.
Subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws,
broker-dealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that
are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other
broker-dealers in recognition of their research and execution
services. In order to cause the fund to pay such higher commissions,
FMR must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable
in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services
provided by such executing broker-dealers, viewed in terms of a
particular transaction or FMR's overall responsibilities to the fund
and its other clients. In reaching this determination, FMR will not
attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research
services provided, or to determine what portion of the compensation
should be related to those services.
The fund has already been authorized by the Board of Trustees,
consistent with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to place
portfolio transactions through broker-dealers who are affiliated with
FMR and through broker-dealers who provide research. The Amended
Contract expressly recognizes this authority.

MATTERS CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD

The mutual funds for which the members of the Board of Trustees serve
as Trustees are referred to herein as the "Fidelity funds." The Board
of Trustees meets eleven times a year. The Board of Trustees,
including the Independent Trustees, believe that matters bearing on
the appropriateness of the fund's management fees are considered at

or the Independent Trustees, as appropriate, act on all major matters,
a significant portion of the activities of the Board of Trustees
(including certain of those described herein) are conducted through
committees. The Independent Trustees meet frequently in executive
session and are advised by independent legal counsel selected by the
Independent Trustees.

The proposal to present the Amended Contract to shareholders was
approved by the Board of Trustees of the fund, including the
Independent Trustees on October 17, 1996. The Board of Trustees
considered and approved the modifications to the Group Fee Rate
schedule during the two month periods from November to December 1995,
June to July 1994, September to October 1993, and November to December
1991. The Board of Trustees consider and approve twice every year
portfolio transactions with broker-dealers who provide research
services to the funds. The Board of Trustees received materials
relating to the Amended Contract in advance of the meeting at which
the Amended Contract was considered, and had the opportunity to ask
questions and request further information in connection with such
consideration.

INFORMATION RECEIVED BY THE INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. In connection with
their monthly meetings Trustees receive materials specifically
relating to the Amended Contract. These materials include: (i)
information on the investment performance of the fund, a peer group of
funds and an appropriate index or combination of indices, (ii) sales
and redemption data in respect of the fund, (iii) the economic outlook
and the general investment outlook in the markets in which the fund
invests, and (iv) notable changes in the fund's investments. The Board
of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also consider periodically
other material facts such as (1) FMR's results and financial
condition, (2) arrangements in respect of the distribution of the
fund's shares, (3) the procedures employed to determine the value of
the fund's assets, (4) the allocation of the fund's brokerage, if any,
including allocations to brokers affiliated with FMR (5) FMR's
management of the relationships with the fund's custodian and
subcustodians, (6) the resources devoted to and the record of
compliance with the fund's investment policies and restrictions and
with policies on personal securities transactions, and (7) the nature,
cost and quality of non-investment management services provided by FMR
and its affiliates.

In response to questions raised by the Independent Trustees,
additional information was furnished by FMR including, among other
items, information on and analysis of (a) the overall organization of
FMR, (b) the choice of performance indices and benchmarks, (c) the
composition of peer groups of funds, (d) transfer agency and
bookkeeping fees paid to affiliates of FMR, (e) investment
performance, (f) investment management staffing, (g) the potential for
achieving further economies of scale, (h) operating expenses paid to
third parties, and (i) the information furnished to investors,
including the fund's shareholders.

In considering the Amended Contract, the Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees did not identify any single factor as
all-important or controlling, and the following summary does not
detail all the matters considered. Matters considered by the Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees in connection with their
approval of the Amended Contract include the following:

INVESTMENT COMPLIANCE AND PERFORMANCE. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered whether the fund has operated within
its investment objective and its record of compliance with its
investment restrictions. They also reviewed monthly the fund's
investment performance as well as the performance of a peer group of
mutual funds, and the performance of an appropriate index or
combination of indices.

FMR'S PERSONNEL AND METHODS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees annually review a report detailing the background
of the fund's portfolio manager, and the fund's investment objective
and discipline. The Independent Trustees have also had discussions
with senior management of FMR responsible for investment operations,
and the senior management of Fidelity's money market group. Among
other things they considered the size, education and experience of
FMR's investment staff, its use of technology, and FMR's approach to
recruiting, training and retaining portfolio managers and other
research, advisory and management personnel.

NATURE AND QUALITY OF OTHER SERVICES. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the nature, quality, cost and extent
of administrative and shareholder services performed by FMR and
affiliated companies, both under the Amended Contract and under
separate agreements covering transfer agency functions and pricing,
bookkeeping and securities lending services, if any. The Board of
Trustees and the Independent Trustees have also considered the nature
and extent of FMR's supervision of third party service providers,
principally custodians and subcustodians.

EXPENSES. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the fund's expense ratio and expense ratios of a peer group
of funds. They also considered the amount and nature of fees paid by
shareholders.

PROFITABILITY. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the level of FMR's profits in respect of the management of
the Fidelity funds, including the fund. This consideration included an
extensive review of FMR's methodology in allocating its costs to the
management of the fund. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees have concluded that the cost allocation methodology employed
by FMR has a reasonable basis and is appropriate in light of all of
the circumstances. They considered the profits realized by FMR in
connection with the operation of the fund and whether the amount of
profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the
fund. They also considered the profits realized from non-fund
businesses which may benefit from or be related to the fund's
business. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees also
considered FMR's profit margins in comparison with available industry
data, both accounting for and ignoring marketing expenses.

ECONOMIES OF SCALE. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees considered whether there have been economies of scale in
respect of the management of the Fidelity funds, whether the Fidelity
funds (including the fund) have appropriately benefitted from any
economies of scale, and whether there is potential for realization of
any further economies of scale. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees have concluded that FMR's mutual fund business
presents some limited opportunities to realize economies of scale and
that these economies are being shared between fund shareholders and
FMR in an appropriate manner. The Independent Trustees have also
concluded that the existing group fee structure should be continued
but determined that it would be appropriate to change the group fee
structure as proposed herein.

OTHER BENEFITS TO FMR. The Board of Trustees and the Independent
Trustees also considered the character and amount of fees paid by the
fund and the fund's shareholders for services provided by FMR and its
affiliates, including fees for services like transfer agency, fund
accounting and direct shareholder services. They also considered the
allocation of fund brokerage to brokers affiliated with FMR and the
receipt of sales loads and payments under Rule 12b-1 plans in respect
of certain of the Fidelity funds. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees also considered the revenues and profitability of
FMR businesses other than its mutual fund business, including FMR's
retail brokerage, correspondent brokerage, capital markets, trust,
investment advisory, pension record keeping, credit card, insurance,
publishing, real estate, international research and investment funds,
and others. The Board of Trustees and the Independent Trustees
considered the intangible benefits that accrue to FMR and its
affiliates by virtue of their relationship with the fund.

OTHER BENEFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS. The Board of Trustees and the
Independent Trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of
investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a
variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of
fund and shareholder services.

With regard to the section of the proposed contract describing the
changes to portfolio transactions, the Trustees considered the value
of research provided by the broker-dealers, the quality of the
execution services provided, and the level of commissions paid. While
the fund does not generally purchase securities through a
broker-dealer by paying commissions, the Board of Trustees determined
that amending the management contract to expressly recognize the
authority of FMR to use affiliated broker-dealers and broker-dealers
who provide research services furthers the goal of standardizing
management contracts for Fidelity funds, and that explicitly
permitting all Fidelity funds to utilize certain broker-dealers is
beneficial to the fund.

CONCLUSION. Based on their evaluation of all material factors and
assisted by the advice of independent counsel, the Trustees concluded

(i) that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable
and (ii) that the proposed modifications to the management fee
structure, that is the reduction of the Group Fee Rate schedule, and
the addition of the discussion of FMR's ability to use brokers and
dealers to execute portfolio transactions, are in the best interest of
the fund's shareholders. The Board of Trustees, including the
Independent Trustees, voted to approve the submission of the Amended
Contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that shareholders
of the fund vote FOR the Amended Contract.

ADOPTION OF STANDARDIZED INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS
The primary purpose of Proposals 6 and 7 is to revise certain of the
funds' investment limitations to conform to limitations which are
standard for similar types of funds managed by FMR. The Board of
Trustees asked FMR to analyze the various fundamental and
non-fundamental investment limitations of the Fidelity funds, and,
where practical and appropriate to a fund's investment objective and
policies, propose to shareholders adoption of standard fundamental
limitations and elimination of certain other fundamental limitations.
Generally, when fundamental limitations are eliminated, Fidelity's
standard non-fundamental limitations replace them. By making these
limitations non-fundamental, the Board of Trustees may amend a
limitation as they deem appropriate, without seeking shareholder
approval. The Board of Trustees would amend the limitations to
respond, for instance, to developments in the marketplace, or changes
in federal or state law. The costs of shareholder meetings called for
these purposes are generally borne by a fund and its shareholders.

It is not anticipated that these proposals will substantially affect
the way a fund is currently managed. However, FMR is presenting them
to you for your approval because FMR believes that increased
standardization will help to promote operational efficiencies and
facilitate monitoring of compliance with fundamental and
non-fundamental investment limitations. Although adoption of a new or
revised limitation is not likely to have any impact on the current
investment techniques employed by a fund, it will contribute to the
overall objectives of standardization.

6. TO AMEND FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S AND
FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL
INVESTMENT LIMITATION CONCERNING THE ISSUANCE OF SENIOR SECURITIES.
Each fund's current fundamental investment limitation regarding the
issuance of senior securities states:

"The fund may not issue bonds or any other class of securities
preferred over shares of the fund in respect of the fund's assets or
earnings, provided that Fidelity Court Street Trust II may issue
additional series of shares in accordance with the Trust Instrument."
The Trustees recommend that shareholders vote to replace this
limitation with the following fundamental investment limitation
governing the issuance of senior securities:

"The fund may not issue senior securities, except as permitted under
the Investment Company Act of 1940."

The primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each fund's
fundamental senior securities limitation to conform to a limitation
that is expected to become standard for all funds managed by FMR. (See
"Adoption of Standardized Investment Limitations" on page        .) If
the proposal is approved, the new fundamental senior securities
limitation cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders.

Adoption of the proposed limitation on senior securities is not
expected to affect the way in which each fund is managed, the
investment performance of each fund, or the securities or instruments
in which each fund invests. However, the proposed limitation clarifies
that each fund may issue senior securities to the extent permitted
under the 1940 Act.

Although the definition of a "senior security" involves complex
statutory and regulatory concepts, a senior security is generally
thought of as an obligation of a fund which has a claim to the fund's
assets or earnings that takes precedence over the claims of the fund's
shareholders. The 1940 Act generally prohibits mutual funds from
issuing senior securities; however, mutual funds are permitted to
engage in certain types of transactions that might be considered
"senior securities" as long as certain conditions are satisfied. For
example, a transaction which obligates a fund to pay money at a future
date (e.g., the purchase of securities for settlement on a date that
is further away than the normal settlement period) may be considered a
"senior security." A mutual fund, however, is permitted to enter into
this type of transaction if it maintains a segregated account
containing liquid securities in an amount equal to its obligation to
pay cash for the securities at a future date. Each fund utilizes
transactions that may be considered "senior securities" only in
accordance with applicable regulatory requirements under the 1940 Act.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit each fund and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended
fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is
revised to reflect the changes. If the proposal is not approved by the
shareholders of a fund, that fund's current limitation will remain
unchanged.

7. TO AMEND FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S,
FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S AND SPARTAN
CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND'S FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT
LIMITATION CONCERNING THE CONCENTRATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN A SINGLE
INDUSTRY.

Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's and Fidelity New
Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's current fundamental investment
limitation concerning the concentration of its investments within a
single industry states:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or any of its
agencies, instrumentalities, territories or possessions,        or
issued or guaranteed by a state government or political subdivision
thereof) if, as a result, more than 25% of the value of its total
assets would be invested in securities of companies having their
principal business activities in the same industry."
Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's current fundamental
investment limitation concerning the concentration of its investments
within a single industry states:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities, or municipal securities issued or
guaranteed by a U.S. territory or possession or a state or local
government, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as
a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested
in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are
in the same industry."

The Trustees recommend that shareholders of each fund vote to replace
this fundamental investment limitation with the following amended
fundamental investment limitation governing concentration:

"The fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer (other than
securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or any of its
agencies or instrumentalities, or tax-exempt obligations issued or
guaranteed by a U.S. territory or possession or a state or local
government, or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing) if, as
a result, more than 25% of the fund's total assets would be invested
in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are
in the same industry."

The primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each fund's
fundamental concentration limitation to conform to a limitation which
is expected to become standard for all municipal funds managed by FMR.
(See "Adoption of Standardized Investment Limitations" on page
.)    For Spartan Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, the
impact of the change in the investment limitation is that certain
private purpose municipal securities that are municipal securities but
not tax-exempt obligations under the Tax-Reform Act of 1986, are no
longer excluded from the concentration limits.     If the proposal is
approved, the new fundamental concentration limitation could not be
changed without the approval of shareholders.

Adoption of the proposed amended limitation on concentration is not
expected to affect the way each fund is managed, the investment
performance of each fund, or the securities or instruments in which
each fund invests.

The proposed amended limitation is not substantially different from
the current policy and is not likely to have any impact on the
investment techniques employed by each fund.

CONCLUSION. The Board of Trustees has concluded that the proposal
will benefit each fund and its shareholders. The Trustees recommend
voting FOR the proposal. Upon shareholder approval, the amended
fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is
revised to reflect the changes. If the proposal is not approved by the
shareholders of a fund, that fund's current limitation will remain
unchanged.

OTHER BUSINESS

The Board knows of no other business to be brought before the
Meeting. However, if any other matters properly come before the
Meeting, it is the intention that proxies that do not contain specific
instructions to the contrary will be voted on such matters in
accordance with the judgment of the persons therein designated.

ACTIVITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF FMR

FMR, a corporation organized in 1946, serves as investment adviser to
a number of investment companies. Information concerning the advisory
fees, net assets, and total expenses of funds with investment
objectives similar to Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund
and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund and advised by FMR
is contained in the Table of Average Net Assets and Expense Ratios in
Exhibit 3 beginning on page .

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, and the
Trustees, from time to time have transactions with various banks,
including the custodian banks for certain of the funds advised by FMR.
Those transactions that have occurred to date have included mortgages
and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of FMR, the
terms and conditions of those transactions were not influenced by
existing or potential custodial or other fund relationships.

The Directors of FMR are Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman of the Board
and of the Executive Committee; Robert C. Pozen, President; and Peter
S. Lynch, Vice Chairman. With the exception of Robert C. Pozen, who is
proposed for election as a Trustee,each of the Directors is also a
Trustee of the trust. Messrs. Johnson 3d, Pozen, J. Gary Burkhead,
John H. Costello, Arthur S. Loring, Thomas D. Maher, Thomas    J.

Simpson, Richard A. Silver, Leonard M. Rush, Fred L. Henning, Jr.,
Boyce    I.     Greer, and Scott A. Orr are currently officers of the
trust and officers or employees of FMR or FMR Corp. With the exception
of Mr. Costello, Mr. Simpson, and Mr. Silver, all of these persons
hold or have options to acquire stock of FMR Corp. The principal
business address of each of the Directors of FMR is 82 Devonshire
Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

All of the stock of FMR is owned by its parent company, FMR Corp., 82
Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109, which was organized on
October 31, 1972. Members of Mr. Edward C. Johnson 3d's family are the
predominant owners of a class of shares of common stock, representing
approximately 49% of the voting power of FMR Corp., and, therefore,
under the 1940 Act may be deemed to form a controlling group with
respect to FMR Corp.

During the period December 1, 1995 through August 31, 1997 no
transactions were entered into by Trustees and nominees as Trustee of
the trust involving more than 1% of the voting common, non-voting
common and equivalent stock, or preferred stock of FMR Corp.

ACTIVITIES AND MANAGEMENT OF FMR TEXAS

FMR Texas is a wholly owned subsidiary of FMR formed in 1989 to
provide portfolio management services to Fidelity's money market funds
and investment advice with respect to money market instruments.

Funds with investment objectives similar to Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money
Market Fund for which FMR has entered into a sub-advisory agreement
with FMR Texas, and the net assets of each of these funds, are
indicated in the Table of Average Net Assets and Expense Ratios in
Exhibit 3 beginning on page .

The Directors of FMR Texas are Edward C. Johnson 3d, Chairman, and
Robert C. Pozen, President. Mr. Johnson 3d also is President and a
Trustee of the trust and of other funds advised by FMR; Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer, President, and a Director of FMR Corp.;

President of the trust and a Senior Vice President and Trustee of
other funds advised by FMR; a Director of FMR Corp.; Director of FMR;
and President and Director of FMR U.K. and FMR Far East. Each of the
Directors is a stockholder of FMR Corp. The principal business address
of the Directors is 82 Devonshire Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109.

PRESENT MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY
MARKET FUND AND FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
Each fund employs FMR to furnish investment advisory and other
services. Under its management contract with each fund, FMR acts as
investment adviser and, subject to the supervision of the Board of
Trustees, directs the investments of each fund in accordance with its
investment objective, policies, and limitations. FMR also provides
each fund with all necessary office facilities and personnel for
servicing each fund's investments, compensates all officers of each
fund and all Trustees who are "interested persons" of the trust or of
FMR, and all personnel of each fund or FMR performing services
relating to research, statistical, and investment activities.

In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the
Board of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services
necessary for the operation of each fund. These services include
providing facilities for maintaining each fund's organization;
supervising relations with custodians, transfer and pricing agents,
accountants, underwriters, and other persons dealing with each fund;
preparing all general shareholder communications and conducting
shareholder relations; maintaining each fund's records and the
registration of each fund's shares under federal and state laws;
developing management and shareholder services for each fund; and
furnishing reports, evaluations, and analyses on a variety of subjects
to the Trustees. Services provided by affiliates of FMR will continue
under the proposed management contract described in proposals 4 and 5.

In addition to the management fee payable to FMR, each fund
reimburses UMB Bank, n.a. (UMB) for its services as the fund's
custodian and transfer agent. Although each fund's current management
contract provides that each fund will pay for typesetting, printing,
and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional information,
notices, and reports to shareholders, the trust, on behalf of each
fund has entered into a revised transfer agent agreement with UMB,
pursuant to which UMB bears the costs of providing these services to
existing shareholders. Other expenses paid by each fund include
interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, and each fund's proportionate
share of insurance premiums and Investment Company Institute dues. The
fund is also liable for such non-recurring expenses as may arise,
including costs of any litigation to which the fund may be a party,
and any obligation it may have to indemnify the trust's officers and
Trustees with respect to litigation.

UMB has entered into a sub-contract with Fidelity Service Company,
Inc. (FSC), an affiliate of FMR, under the terms of which FSC performs
the processing activities associated with providing transfer agent and
shareholder servicing functions for the fund. Under the sub-contract,
FSC bears the expense of typesetting, printing, and mailing
prospectuses, statements of additional information, and all other
reports, notices, and statements to shareholders, except proxy
statements. FSC also pays all out-of-pocket expenses associated with
transfer agent services. Transfer agent fees and pricing and
bookkeeping fees, including reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses,
paid to FSC by UMB on behalf of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money
Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund for
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996 were $578,870 and $910,968,
respectively.

Each fund also has a distribution agreement with FDC, a Massachusetts
corporation organized on July 18, 1960. FDC is a broker-dealer
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Each
distribution agreement calls for FDC to use all reasonable efforts,
consistent with its other business, to secure purchasers for shares of
the fund, which are continuously offered at net asset value per share.
Promotional and administrative expenses in connection with the offer
and sale of shares are paid by FMR.

FMR is Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund's and
Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's manager pursuant to
management contracts dated February 28, 1992, which were approved by
Court Street Trust, then sole shareholder of the fund on March 1,
1992.

For the services of FMR under the contract, each fund pays FMR a
monthly management fee composed of the sum of two elements: a group
fee rate and an individual fund fee rate.

The group fee rate is based on the monthly average net assets of all
of the registered investment companies with which FMR has management
contracts and is calculated on a cumulative basis pursuant to the
graduated fee rate schedule shown below on the left. The schedule
on page      on the right shows the effective annual group fee rate
at various asset levels, which is the result of cumulatively applying
the annualized rates on the left. For example, the effective annual
fee rate at $447 billion of group net assets - the approximate level
for November 1996 - was 0.1429%, which is the weighted average of the
respective fee rates for each level of group net assets up to $447
billion.

Under each fund's current management contract with FMR, the group fee
rate is based on a schedule with breakpoints ending at .1500% for
average group assets in excess of $84 billion. The group fee rate
breakpoints shown above for average group assets in excess of $120
billion and under $228 billion were voluntarily adopted by FMR on
January 1, 1992. The additional breakpoints shown above for average
group assets in excess of $228 billion were voluntarily adopted by FMR
on November 1, 1993.

On August 1, 1994, FMR voluntarily revised the prior extensions to
the group fee rate schedule, and added new breakpoints for average
group assets in excess of $156 billion and under $372 billion as shown
in the schedule below, pending shareholder approval of a new
management contract reflecting the revised schedule. The revised group
fee rate schedule provides for lower management fee rates as FMR's
assets under management increase. The revised group fee rate schedule
was identical to the above schedule for average group assets under
$156 billion.

On January 1, 1996, FMR voluntarily added new breakpoints to the
revised schedule for average group assets in excess of $372 billion,
pending shareholder approval of a new management contract reflecting
the revised schedule and additional breakpoints. The revised group fee
rate schedule and its extensions provide for lower management fee
rates as FMR's assets under management increase. For average group
assets in excess of $156 billion, the revised group fee rate schedule
with additional breakpoints voluntarily adopted by FMR is as follows:

The individual fund fee rate is 0.25%. Based on the average group net
assets of the funds advised by FMR for November 30, 1996, the annual
management fee rate would be calculated as follows:

FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND








Group Fee Rate         Individual Fund         Management Fee Rate
                       Fee Rate

0.1429%          +     0.25%             =     0.3929%

FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
Group Fee Rate         Individual Fund         Management Fee Rate
                       Fee Rate

0.1429%          +     0.25%             =     0.3929%








One-twelfth of this annual management fee rate is applied to each
fund's net assets averaged for the month, giving a dollar amount,
which is the fee for that month.

During fiscal year ended November 30, 1996, FMR received $1,308,203
and $1,726,411 for its services as investment adviser to Fidelity
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey
Municipal Money Market Fund, respectively. This fee was equivalent to
0.3956% and 0.3956%, respectively, of the average net assets of
Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New
Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund.

FMR may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a portion of
each fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes,
brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses). FMR retains the
ability to be repaid for these expense reimbursements in the amount
that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal
year. Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase each fund's total
returns and yield and repayment of the reimbursement by each fund will
lower its total returns and yield.

SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS FOR FIDELITY CONNECTICUT MUNICIPAL MONEY
MARKET FUND AND FIDELITY NEW JERSEY MUNICIPAL MONEY MARKET FUND
On behalf of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and
Fidelity New jersey Municipal Money Market Fund, FMR has entered into
a sub-advisory agreement with FMR Texas Inc. (FMR Texas) pursuant to
which FMR Texas has primary responsibility for providing portfolio
investment management services to each fund. Fidelity Connecticut
Municipal Money Market Fund's sub-advisory agreement, dated February
28, 1992, was approved by Court Street Trust as sole shareholder of
the fund on March 1, 1992 pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Conversion approved by shareholders of the fund on December 11, 1991.
Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market Fund's sub-advisory
agreement, dated February 28, 1992, was approved by Court Street Trust
as sole shareholder of the fund on March 1, 1992 pursuant to an
Agreement and Plan of Conversion approved by shareholders of the fund
on December 11, 1991. The terms of Fidelity Connecticut Municipal
Money Market Fund's and Fidelity New Jersey Municipal Money Market
Fund's current sub-advisory agreements with FMR Texas duplicate those
of their previous sub-advisory agreements which were dated November 1,
1990 and December 1, 1989, respectively and approved by FMR as sole
shareholder.

Under the sub-advisory agreements, FMR pays FMR Texas fees equal to
50% of the management fee payable to FMR under its management contract
with each fund after payments by FMR pursuant to each fund's 12b-1
plan, if any. The fees paid to FMR Texas are not reduced by any
voluntary or mandatory expense reimbursements that may be in effect
from time to time. For the fiscal year ended November 30, 1996, FMR
paid FMR Texas fees of $654,102 and $863,206, on behalf of Fidelity
Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund and Fidelity New Jersey
Municipal Money Market Fund, respectively.

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are
placed on behalf of each fund by FMR pursuant to authority contained
in the fund's management contract.

FMR may place agency transactions with National Financial Services
Corporation (NFSC) an indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp., if the
commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions
charged by non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms for similar
services.

During fiscal 1996 the funds paid no brokerage commissions to
affiliated brokers.
