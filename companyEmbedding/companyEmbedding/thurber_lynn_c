    Executive Speaker Series







On November 14th, Frank Cohen (center), Senior Managing Director of Blackstone’s Real Estate Group, joined a group of Kellogg students for lunch and discussed Blackstone’s strategy, his career, the state of the real estate markets, and provided career and investing advice. Also pictured at the head table are Sean O’Grady, President, Kellogg Real Estate Club (left), Craig Furfine, Clinical Professor of Finance (right) and students of the Kellogg Real Estate Club.

Our executive speaker series was launched in May of 2004. Our inaugural speaker was Sam Zell. His presentation was attended by 25 students from the Kellogg Real Estate Club and several real estate faculty members as well as Dean Jacobs. The format then is much like today: Over lunch at the Allen Center, the executive provides an informal overview of his/her views on the commercial real estate market, which is followed by a question-and-answer period with the students and faculty. The series is a joint effort between the Kellogg Real Estate Program, Kellogg Real Estate Club and the Guthrie Center for Real Estate Research, but was initiated by the Zell Center for Risk Research. 

The Kellogg Real Estate Executive Speaker Series provides our students an informal forum to exchange ideas with and ask questions of leading real estate executives. This interaction with key members of the real estate industry provides the students with varied and insightful perspectives on leadership, investment management, competition, personal development and other significant issues. The program also fosters positive relationships between key industry practitioners (and their company(ies)) and the Kellogg Real Estate Program.

LaSalle Investment Management Chairman and former ULI Global Chairman Lynn C. Thurber has been named the 2015 Lifetime Achievement Award recipient by the Urban Land Institute’s Chicago District Council (ULI Chicago).  The Lifetime Achievement Award, now in its twenty-first year, was established to recognize professionals in Chicago’s real estate community whose lifetime contributions to real estate – and to civic, charitable and philanthropic endeavors – exemplify the spirit and mission of ULI.
”Lynn has been an inspiration, role model and mentor to many women and men across our industry and around the world,” said Jeff Jacobson, Chief Executive Officer of LaSalle Investment Management and Co-Chair of the Host Committee. “Most recently as ULI’s global chairman and before that as chief executive officer of LaSalle Investment Management, Lynn has been at the forefront of many of the most important trends in the industry today including globalization, sustainability and diversity within the workplace.”
He added: “Beyond her accomplishments, Lynn’s most enduring leadership trait is her uncompromising honesty and integrity.  No matter what the situation, Lynn has always abided by the principle of putting honesty and clients above all else which has earned her the utmost trust and respect within our industry.”
The Lifetime Achievement Award honors an individual whose achievements throughout their lifetime exemplify personal and professional contributions to the real estate industry and to the community. Ms. Thurber was recognized and celebrated at the ULI Chicago Lifetime Achievement Award dinner earlier this month.
Past recipients of the award have included Marshall Bennett, Marshall Bennett Enterprises; the late Bernie Weissbourd, Metropolitan Structures; the late Charles H. Shaw, The Shaw Company; the late Richard J. Brown, Cambridge Homes; Lester Crown, Material Service Corporation; the late William A. Alter, The Alter Group; Edward R. James, Edward R. James Partners, LLC; Kenneth J. James, Kenneth James Builders, LLC; the late Matthew Bucksbaum, General Growth Properties, Inc.; Richard A. Stein, Mesirow Stein Real Estate, Inc.; Stuart L. Scott, Jones Lang LaSalle; Douglas Crocker II, former Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees and CEO of Equity Residential; Robert A. Wislow, U.S. Equities Realty; Norman R. Bobins, Chairman Emeritus, LaSalle Bank Corporation; Richard A. Hanson, Mesa Development, LLC; James R. Loewenberg, Magellan Development Group; John S. Gates, Jr., PortaeCo, LLC; John A. Buck, The John Buck Company; Penny Pritzker, Secretary of Commerce, U.S. Department of Commerce; and, Neil G. Bluhm, Founder and President, JMB Realty Corporation.
The criteria for the award is a lifetime of professional, personal and civic commitments to the real estate profession and to our community at large. Nominations are solicited from the ULI membership and a Lifetime Jury is convened to identify the recipient.
“Lynn has been such an outstanding leader for ULI’s global organization as well as the real estate industry here in Chicago and we are honored she will be accepting the Award” said Doug Lyons, Managing Director, Pearlmark Real Estate, ULI Trustee, and Chair, ULI Chicago Lifetime Achievement Award.
