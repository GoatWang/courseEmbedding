Monthly service charge can be waived by maintaining a monthly average balance of at least $7,500 in up to 3 linked Webster Complete Business Checking accounts (the “relationship package”). You may create a relationship package of up to 3 Webster Complete Business Checking accounts. The aggregated monthly average balance of these accounts (the “relationship package”) will be calculated to determine if the account designated as the Primary is entitled to a service charge waiver based on maintaining the monthly average balance required to avoid the monthly service charge for that statement period. Secondary linked accounts will always be free of the monthly service charge, provided a primary account is present. Authorized signers on any of the accounts are entitled to determine which accounts are included in the relationship package provided that they are a signer on each of the accounts they designate. Accounts can be added or removed at the sole discretion of the signers on the individual accounts in the relationship package. If you remove or close the Primary account in the relationship, it will result in dissolving the relationship package and subject each account to the monthly average balance requirement to waive the monthly service charge. In addition, removal of one of the secondary accounts from the relationship, by a signer, may result in the Primary account being subject to a service charge without notice to all other signers, should the monthly aggregated balances fall below the balance to waive threshold. Other miscellaneous fees may apply.

Webster Business Value Checking: Minimum opening deposit of $500 is required. $11.95 monthly service charge. Monthly service charge can be waived if you maintain a monthly average balance of at least $2,500 or are the primary owner of a personal Premier checking account. Receive 100 free transactions that include checks paid, checks deposited, deposit tickets, ACH debits and credits, bill or tax payments through Webster online, ATM deposits/withdrawals and debit card purchases – using signature or PIN (Personal Identification Number). There is a fee of $0.50 per transaction in excess of 100. Fees for cash deposits are: $1.00 for each $1,000 cash deposited, plus $.10 for every additional $100 deposited, per business day. Other miscellaneous fees may apply. Webster will waive the monthly maintenance fee on either a Webster Business Value Checking account or a personal Webster Value Checking account when you open and maintain a Webster Business Value Checking account. If you choose the additional Webster Business Value Checking account, all charges for excess transactions and excess daily cash deposits will apply. If the Webster Business Value Checking account associated with the account is closed for any reason, the normal monthly service charges will apply.

Webster Commercial Checking for Small Business: Minimum opening deposit of $500 is required. $27.00 monthly service charge. Fee may be offset through earnings credit. Fees for cash deposits are: $1.00 for each $1,000 cash deposited, plus $.20 for every additional $100 deposited, per business day.

							Review:  Transaction details not explained, resulting in fees that were not expected or discovered for an entire year.
Last night (4/14/13), while researching my online Webster account, I was surprised to see a $12 fee associated ****** my Money Market product.Checking back I discovered 12 months of charges. The problem began when in 4/2012 I asked if I could transfer money from the MM to my checking account. The rep replied to the affirmative so I made the adjustment online. What he DIDN'T say was that if  the balance of the Money Market fell below $2500, a $12 per month fee would result. This error of omission cost me $130 in accumulated debits. A call to their rep this morning resulted in just 2 payments ($24) being credited back to my account.I failed to review each monthly statement because it is a Money Market whose balance should remain the same (I do checking account reconciliations each month because of the constant change in the numbers). I realize the customer should be aware of the bank's terms on each account but let's be realistic - when a person chooses a bank he initially reads the literature but can't be expected to recall every detail, especially when many years have passed since originally becoming a client.It should be the duty of the rep to apprise each customer of the cost ramifications of every transaction before it is made. It is a simple courtesy that could save their client a significant amount of money over time. People forget things as simple as passwords and user names; remembering complicated and numerous details about banking matters over the course of years is hardly possible. I sought the full $130 to be replaced in my account but was denied so seeking it here would be an exercise in futility. Webster essentially used my money to MAKE money and charged me for the privilege (I was making 9 cents in interest and paying them $12 a month in service fees). I ask Webster to respect and assist their customers in the way I alluded to above and caution each of their depositors TO CAREFULLY REVIEW EACH STATEMENT EVERY MONTH TO AVOID CHARGES THEY MAY NEVER EVEN BE AWARE OF. Desired Settlement:  As mentioned above, I requested the fees be forgiven in total but was only allowed 2 months worth. In view of the circumstances - and my long association ************** - I think it would be a gracious gesture to grant me that but doubt they would comply.

RE: Letter to Better Business Bureau

Dear Mr. ******;

I am writing to you in response to your letter to the Better Business Bureau regarding monthly service charges you received on your Webster Money Market Account. I sincerely apologize for any frustration you may have experienced. 

I understand your concern as it relates to the monthly service charge on your account. ****** is committed to providing you ****** value for your money, exceptional convenience, and the best personal service in banking.  We offer other saving accounts that may better suit your financial needs while avoiding monthly service charges.

In addition to the $24.00 you have received in rebates I will credit your checking account ending in 7791 an additional four (4) fees for a total of $48.00, which will account for half of the fees that were assessed. 

At Webster, we consider the servicing of our customers to be our top priority. We take your comments seriously and have addressed and shared this matter ****** the parties involved and the appropriate levels of management. 

I have also submitted your comments regarding your experience to our Voice of the Customer program which is reviewed by our executive management. 

Thank you for taking the time to contact us. If you have any additional concerns or questions, please contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Sincerely,

Consumer Response /* (2110, 7, 2013/04/26) */
(The consumer indicated he/she ACCEPTED the partial settlement response from the business.)
I have no objection to the fee, just the failure of the bank rep to point out that one would be imposed if I implemented the transaction. Being made aware of that charge would have convinced me to replenish the needed funds in my checking account from another source (without a fee). I am all for personal responsibility but not everyone has instant recall on the terms of the account and Webster employees should be instructed to invest the 5-10 seconds it would take to apprise the customer of a looming charge on any transaction. If, as in my case, it is not monitored then a substantial penalty could result over time of which the client is completely unaware. It is a matter of simple consideration and the way any business who is looking out for the best interests of their loyal customers should operate.

							Review:  I own a condo purchased in the ****** ********* District of **********. For this reason I get two tax bills, on from ********** and one from the **** District. When we closed on the property, the woman handling the close assured me that the way that it was worded, that all "**********" tax bills were included in escrow. They instructed ********** to send them both bills, and I spoke with **********, that's exactly what they did. The problem is that ******* hadn't actually escrowed for the **** tax (fine, I owe the tax, that's not the problem) so when they received the bill, they threw it out and didn't notify me. So I got a late tax bill with a penalty. I called the 1-800 number for ******* to find out what happened, and I was told a manager would call me in 24 hours. No one ever called. I waited a week, and I walked to a branch at lunch and she tried to get me an answer as to what went wrong, how to fix it, and how to get reimbursed my penalty for their issue. Eventually she couldn't do anything more and couldn't get an answer so she had me call the escrow number directly. I left a message and was called back two days later. The woman said I needed to send a request in writing. She also informed me that the company's policy is to throw out any bills they have not escrowed for. I sent my request via e-mail on 11/17/2015 to the address I was given, addressed to "Nicole" and I have not heard a thing. I am tired of chasing no one. Please help me rectify the situation and the customer service issue of throwing away tax bills. I have another property in the same zip code, and we escrow for both. I was told during the close process that they set it up to mirror that property, so I don't know what the issue is.Desired Settlement:  1) Fix my problem going forward
2) reimburse me the late fee (it's not a large amount just the principle)
3) re-evaluate "throwing away" tax bills without contacting your customers.

RE: Letter to the Better Business Bureau

Dear Ms. ******:

I am writing in response to your letter dated April 9, 2013 to the Better Business Bureau. I apologize for any frustration you may have experienced.

When your Visa Check Card is used for a purchase, funds are held and are no longer available for other transactions. These items are submitted by merchants for approval and will have a hold period, generally, of no more than three business days for domestic transactions. We do not have access to any outstanding purchases and or debits you have not informed us of.

****** regards to your situation; checks, Automated Clearing House (ACH) items, purchases, and debits are presented for payment when there are pending authorization holds on the account. As a result, fees are assessed as outlined in the deposit account disclosures you were provided ****** at account opening. These deposit account disclosures outline our overdraft and fees policies and by signing the signature card and use of the account, you agree to the terms and conditions of the account.

There were numerous Visa Check Card debits during the months of March and April. In addition several checks and ACH withdrawals were presented for payment. Due to the pending authorization holds in effect for the items presented during this time period, there were not enough available funds in your account. This resulted in numerous fees being assessed to your account. 

Fees are assessed the next business day after an item posts against insufficient/unavailable funds. Our records indicate that on March 22, 2013, as a courtesy, Webster Bank credited your account $222.00.

We recommend that transactions are written in your check register or an electronic equivalent, deducting the amounts of checks, ATM withdrawals, check card purchases and any automatic bill payments as they occur. 
Our online banking is also a great way to keep track of your balances. We offer balance Alerts via text message or email, so you will know when your balance has hit the "low balance" threshold that you've set. In addition, your account balance information is available online at websteronline.com, can be assesses via our automated telephone system, 24 hours a day, 7 days  week by dialing X-XXX-XXX-XXXX and following the voice prompts, or by calling our Customer care enter form 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, seven days a week.

Thank you for taking the time to write and for allowing Webster Bank to serve your banking needs. Please contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX ****** any questions.

Sincerely,

Consumer Response /* (3000, 7, 2013/04/25) */
(The consumer indicated he/she DID NOT ACCEPT the response from the business.)
the bank is only being partially truthful. i do not believe they should have your account online showing dates of trans and withdrawals. one day a check will clear or a deposit will be made and your account is ok the next day those withdrawals and deposits are moved to benifit them. my only response would be to move my account to a more trustworthy bank or credit union. ive been watching them move things around, it could even be on the same date, so that they could charge a fee. i take it out of my register but i know just as much as they do when a check will hit the account. actually they know more because they choose to hold them and move them.its easier to get away ****** this when someone doesnt have  alot of money in there account.

RE: Letter to the Better Business Bureau-Rebuttal

Dear Ms. ******:

I am writing in response to your second letter dated April 25, 2013 to the Better Business Bureau. 

Webster Bank, as a National Association Bank, is governed by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and as such our policies are in accordance ****** their requirements.

As I stated in my response to you dated April 24, 2013, when your Visa Check Card is used for a purchase, funds are held and are no longer available for other transactions. These items are submitted by merchants for approval and will have a hold period, generally, of no more than three business days for domestic transactions. 

Please be aware that your account balance fluctuates throughout the day based on the transactions made and the availability of deposited funds.  Although the account balance may not be negative, there may be times when a pending debit card authorization can reduce the available balance, as was what happened in your case.

When you view your account information online, you will see "Pending Transactions" and "Posted Transactions" information. Check card signature, point of sale transactions, and Automated Clearing House (ACH) debits listed under Pending Transactions are now reflected immediately in your available balance and are listed under "Type" as a Check Card Authorization, Check Card Purchase, or Other Debit respectively. After the items have been posted, when you view your account information online it may appear that the funds were available at the time fee(s) was assessed.








At the time of account opening, account disclosures were provided to you and included was information pertaining to the "Order of Posting Transactions" as outlined on pages 17 and 18 in our Deposit Account Disclosures that you were provided ****** at account opening.

I have shared your comments concerning this ****** the appropriate levels of management and have also submitted your remarks to our Voice of the Customer program which is reviewed by our executive management. 

If you have any further questions or concerns you may contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX.

Sincerely,

							Review:  There was a fraudulent charge on my bank acct for $313.00 on 5/9/2015, account number **********- I was in ****** at the time of the charge and my husband was in *******. The charge was made at a **** *** **** in ********* **. I opened a police report (********) the following day after learning they caught this charge because I tried to use my card on my way home and it was denied. I called them immediately. They opened a dispute- I was waiting and waiting for a paper to sign saying I didn't make the charge and I got a letter stating this dispute was denied because the card was present???  I got that letter last night, and I called the bank today and there is nothing that they can do until Monday. It has been 5 business days, 7 days since this charge and I have late credit card bills and this is a real inconvenience. This is horrible. I have called several times this week to the bank and no one told me this. I live paycheck to paycheck and I am really feeling unsafe with thisDesired Settlement:  I would like my money credited to my account so that I can close my
Account and go elsewhere.

Dear Ms. ********:

 

I am writing in response to your recent letter to the

experienced.

 

It is my understanding that you spoke to a representative
in our ATM department on Monday, May 18, 2015 regarding your concerns as
outlined in your letter. 

 

I was informed your entire claim was denied in error as
one of the items you had disputed was recalled as being yours. However, due to
a misunderstanding from one of our Customer Care Center employees, your entire
dispute was cancelled which included the other unauthorized claim for the
$313.00 from **** *** **** on May 11, 2015.

 

I have verified that your ******* **** checking account
ending in **** has been issued a final credit, effective May 18, 2015 in the
amount of $313.00 for the unauthorized debit from **** *** **** dated May 11,
2015.

 

At ******* **** we strive for excellence in everything
that we do, and take pride in our customer service. Your comments are very much
appreciated and beneficial in helping us provide the best service possible to

Review: ********
I appreciate that the credit was made to my account. This does not make up for my frustrations, late fees for bills I couldn't pay etc. I am beyond upset that I had to wait 9 days for a credit, and it's more upsetting that not 1 but 3 employees made stupid choices. I can't believe I didn't get a phone call, is this how you treat your customers?

							Review:  I have had a business account with ******* **** for several years.  I recently noticed that they were charging erroneous overdraft fee's to my account. On Thursday March 19th I paid several bills via the vendor (not on line banking) and received authorization that the payments were posted to the vendor accounts.  The money was deducted from my account at ******* on Thursday 3/19/2015.  When I accessed my account on Friday 3/20/15, the payments were deducted and it was reflected in my available balance (it was now about $1800 less due to the bill payments).  During the day on Friday a small check deposit was made, and on Friday evening I checked my account again.  All was good with the balances , and no issues.  When I checked the account again Saturday morning, I noticed that a scheduled *** had come out of my account late Friday evening, and it  caused my account to go in the negative.  I also noticed that ******* **** had changed the system and applied that *** deduction FIRST on Friday and over drafted my account for 7 of the payments that were made and deducted on 3/19/15.... a total of $259.00!    Needless to say, I was upset and contacted the ******* **** in *********** **.  I spoke to the assistant manager ******* on Saturday 3/21/14.  This situation prompted me to contact my CPA and go through my statements for the last year. During this review, we noticed that there were 38 overdraft fee's - totaling over $1400 that were deducted from my account! Transactions that were cleared and still left my account in positive standing.  (Only to be charged an overdraft 2 or 3 days later).    I contacted the manager **** ** of ******* **** in *********** **. today 3/24/15 and was told "they only go back two months" and he would pass along the information to **** *****.  I then accessed my ******* account again and noticed that I was being charged for 4 more over draft fee's!!  At this point, based on my statements and records, ******* **** has deducted nearly $1800 in overdraft fee's that I do not feel are accurate.Desired Settlement:  I would like my money refunded back.  I would also like an explanation as to  WHY ******* **** is still applying the largest payment at the bottom (resulting in over charges) regardless of when the money was deducted from my account. And,  I would also like an explanation as to WHY my monthly ******* ****s statements reflect positive balances and I was still charged fees.

							Review:  I worked on a refi for my in-laws in December 2012-February 2013. It not only took forever to close, but we kept getting more paperwork to sign after the closing. The WORST part is that the rep, Kimberly Lynch, just happened to "forget" to tell us that military (active or retired) get $500 back at loan closing.  I found out a week or so after the closing while looking at Webster's website for an answer to a question I had.  When I asked her about that, she said she simply forgot to ask during the assessment since she was talking with me and not them and that they won't make good on the money back!  Oh, OK-no problem.  The bank withheld $500 from a couple of seniors, one of which is going through cancer treatment-no problem that you didn't do your job!  BIG thanks for serving our country!  Now the loan was sold to Fannie *** a week before the first payment was to begin.  Webster Bank is not to be trusted.
Desired Settlement:  DesiredSettlementID: Refund
Would love if my in-laws could have $500 deposited into their account as deserved.  Thanks.

							Review:  On Friday May 24, 2013, I proceeded to pay my Webster Bill (home Equity Bill).  Called the XXXX-XXX-XXXX line. That is the automatic paying line number. So paying my bill will get posted with the date of 5/24/2013.  My bill for 4/25/2013 is 131.89. My next statement due is 138.20 DUE ON 5/25/2013.  Webster bank would not except my payment due of 131.89 unless i payed my next bill THAT IS NOT DUE UNTIL 5/25/2013.  They are making me pay my monthly payment which is not due yet. I have legal paperwork from the bank that payment are not payed until the 25th of each month. I have my monthly statement that clearly states "PAYMENT DUE DATE 5/25/2013 for the amount of $131.89".  I talked to numerous people today on 5/24/2013 about this problem. No one cared. Webster Bank is clearly stealing money from people so they can make a profit.  How dare you take what is not legally yours to take. One of your so called customer service reps said "WELL ITS CLOSE ENUFF".  I asked to take to a manager and they said they will call you in 48 hours??? Are you kidding me.  Webster Bank STOLE MONEY FROM ME!! I had to pay my bill owed of $131.89 plus what is not DUE YET of $138.20 Conf# XXXXXXXXXX.  Total of 270.09. NO ONE WOULD HELP OR TRY TO HELP.  No one could over ride the automatic system that steals payments that are not even due! I had to use the phone automatic system I could not use the webster online system. Webster should be ashamed of STEALING. I have all Legal paperwork from bank on the loan due date..
Desired Settlement:  DesiredSettlementID: Refund
I want my money returned to me. The money that Webster stole from me. $138.20.  plus interest. I was not even Due to you at this time.  I want the phone automatic payment to be fixed. Stealing money to make a profit. You should be ashamed.

RE: Letter to the Better Business Bureau

I am writing in response to your recent letter to the Better Business Bureau. I apologize for any frustration you may have experienced.

Our records indicate that on May 24, 2013 you attempted to make the April payment of $131.89 for your Webster loan XXXXXXXXX, using our automated loan payment system, which did not allow this amount to be paid.  Due to system limitations for automated loan payments over the phone, the amount due included both your April and May ($138.20) payments in order to bring the account current. As a result, to make sure your payment was made before the due date of the 25th, you made a payment of $270.09.

On May 25, 2013, in response to your request for a refund of the additional payment of $138.20, we reversed out this payment and sent you a refund check for that amount. 

Payments made at our Banking Centers, via WebsterOnline, or by calling our Customer Care Center to make a Draft by Phone payment will allow you to avoid this in the future. 

At Webster Bank we strive for excellence in everything that we do, and take pride in our customer service. I have shared your comments concerning this matter and the service you received with the appropriate levels of management. 

Your remarks are very much appreciated and beneficial in helping us provide the best service possible to our customers and have been submitted to our Voice of the Customer program which is reviewed by our executive management. If you have any further questions or concerns please contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX.

							Review:  When I opened up this account I was promised $50 for opening a checking account with this bank, and never received it. I contacted the bank three times through email and four times through customer service and not once did I get a response from anybody regarding the $50 that was owed to me. Secondly they closed my account with no notice and I was unable to access my own money because the bank closed my account for no reason, after I have had an account with them for over two months. It is now Mother's Day and I cannot take out my own money to buy my mother a gift in the account because they have stole my money. I have no way to access my own money in my account. They should be prosecuted.

							Review:  Recently I've been having a dispute with Webster Bank regarding over draft charges posted on my account in the past and possibly immediate future. I've contacted customer services, and I've also visited a branch in my locale without any sort of resolution. To make matters worse I actually left my local branch with a sense of defeat. I would like to explain matters as thoroughly as possible. On December 8th 2014  an unauthorized payment by ***** bank was withdrawn from my account in error. Before the funds were withdrawn I made contact with Webster bank to advise of the mishap and attempt to cancel the payment from my account as I was very well away I did not have the adequate funds for the payment to be clears without getting an over draft. It seems during this time I was indeed over drafted which one fee of $37 was reversed by Webster, but I also had a 2nd which I was billed for which has yet to be explained to me. In addition if the charge was refunded, why would all over draft charges incurred during that time be refunded as well? Now fast forward to present. It appears my account was pending transactions that would have brought my account to a negative balance one cleared. I promptly deposited enough to cover the possible negative balance in addition to the 2 charges of $37 I was informed i would be charged. I as also informed nothing could be done in the matter. While in the branch I requested a manager which was denied. I explained my situation and I was told "The manager said she'll call you". I advised the teller if a resolution is not met I will be withdrawing my funds and closing my account as well as filing a complaint with the Revdex.com. This was on December 18th. I await the branch managers call still as i write this complaintDesired Settlement:  I would like the charges from December 2014 to be refunded as this was a legitimate error, I would also like for any overage charges to be refunded. This would be the ideal outcome.

RE: Letter to the Better Business Bureau

I am writing in response to your letter dated April 11, 2013 to the Better Business Bureau. 

As was stated in my response to you dated October 2, 2012, copy enclosed, when you contacted the Better Business Bureau ****** a similar concern; when a Visa Check Card is used for a purchase, funds are held and are no longer available for other transactions. These items are submitted by merchants for approval and will have a hold, generally, for no more than three business days for domestic transactions. We do not have access to any outstanding purchases and or debits you have informed us of.

****** regards to your situation again; checks, Automated Clearing House (ACH) items, purchases, and debits are presented for payment when there are pending authorization holds on the account. As a result, fees are assessed as outlined in the deposit account disclosures you were provided ****** at account opening. These deposit account disclosures outline our overdraft and fees policies and by signing the signature card and use of the account, you agree to the terms and conditions of the account.

There were numerous Visa Check Card debits, checks presented, and Automated Clearing House (ACH) debits dated from April 8, 2013 through April 10, 2013.  

Due to the pending authorization holds in effect for the Visa Check Card transactions, there were not enough available funds in your account for the other items presented. Fees are assessed the next business day after an item posts against insufficient/unavailable funds, and your deposit are being made the day after the debits occurred. 

Your account is not eligible for further rebates at this time as the fees were not assessed due to bank error. 






Thank you for taking the time to write and for allowing Webster Bank to service your banking needs. Please contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX ****** any further questions.

Dear Mr. ******:

I am writing in response to your letter dated September 21, 2012 to the Better Business Bureau. I apologize for any frustration you may have experienced.

When your Visa Check Card is used for a purchase, funds are held and are no longer available for other transactions. These items are submitted by merchants for approval and will have a hold period, generally, of no more than three business days for domestic transactions. We do not have access to any outstanding purchases and or debits you have not informed us of. 

****** regards to your situation, checks, Automated Clearing House (ACH) items, purchases, and debits are presented for payment when there are pending authorization holds on the account. As a result, fees are assessed as outlined in the deposit account disclosures you were provided ****** at account opening. These deposit account disclosures outline our overdraft and fee policies and by signing the signature card and use of the account, you agree to the terms and conditions of the account. 

There were numerous Visa Check Card debits dated from September 17th through September 23rd. In addition check number 2137 for $140.00 dated from August 1, 2012, and three (3) other checks all dated September 11, 2012 numbered 2106, 2107, and 2108 for $37.00 each were presented for payment on September 19th. Due to the pending authorization holds in effect for items on September 17th and 18th, there were not enough available funds in your account. This resulted in seven (5) $37.00 fees dated from September 19th, 20th, and 21st for items paid against insufficient funds. Fees are assessed the next business day after an item posts against insufficient/unavailable funds.

As a courtesy I have credited your account for $185.00 which accounts for these fees.



We recommend that transactions are written in your check register or an electronic equivalent, deducting the amounts of checks, ATM withdrawals, check card purchases and any automatic bill payments as they occur.

Our online banking is also a great way to keep track of your balances.  We offer Balance Alerts via text message or e-mail, so you will know when your balance has hit the "low balance" threshold that you've set. In addition, your account balance information is available online at websteronline.com, can be accessed via our automated telephone system, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by dialing X-XXX-XXX-XXXX and following the voice prompts, or by calling our Customer Care Center from 7:00 am to 10:00 pm, seven days a week. 

Thank you for taking the time to write and for allowing Webster Bank to serve your banking needs. Please contact me at X-XXX-XXX-XXXX ****** any further questions.

							Review:  I opened a savings account when my son was one month old as a custodial account in which I was the custodial parent . This was in 1998, at *** *** ****. Nine years ago, new mil merged with *******, my accounts were automatically switched. Unknown to me, the accounts were not set up as custodial accounts which is what I had, they were set up as joint accounts. I was never notified of the switch.      Last month, my ex husband, who is on probation for larceny, picked up my oldest son for a visit for five days. The next day, he brought him to ******* bank in ********* and had him sign to close at our account for approximately $1300. My ex husband informed me that I would never see that money again, I put in most of the money since his birth.       When I went to the bank and asked how this could have happened, they said they couldn't find the records when the banks merged. That is not my fault thAt they can't find the records. They are trying to cover their mistake. I want them to reimburse the money.         ***** ********Desired Settlement:  I want them to reimburse theory and fix their mistake.

							Review:  I had recently opened a Webster Bank checking account online less than a month ago. I had set up direct deposit with my employer. My employer takes two weeks to set up direct deposit. I had called to order paper checks with my account. I was not aware of any charge to order the checks. But when I reviewed my account online, it was showing my account to be negative $84.00, all of which was in overdraft fees. There was no charge on my account for the checks, only the overdraft charges appeared when I checked my transaction history online. I called Webster Bank's customer service number on 1/2/2016 and the representative informed me she was only able to reverse $42.00 in the overdraft fees on my account.Desired Settlement:  I would like to kindly request that the other $42.00 in overdraft fees be reversed as well, since I feel that this was not an error on my account, and that this is a new account and would like to maintain my banking relationship with Webster Bank. Thank You.

							Review:  I have incurred 7 NSF fund fees of $37 within a three week period. One if the fees I am not disputing as I was responsible for saidfee. The other six were charged to my checking account when I had a positive balance. I was told this was done because of their overdraft protection plan which I was automatically enrolled in when my account was opened I was told after my second call to customer services. I told them to promptly take me out of that program. At that time they had overturned one of the 6 fees as a convenience to me.I the proceeded to go into a branch to inquire about why I was being charged the other fees. I had an email detailing the charges that I was being over drafted for, however when I went into the bank the manager had told me that I was being charged for different debits that were made on a day my account had more than enough to cover the debits made. The manager saw that something was wrong and called customer service herself only to have them tell me that I was wrong and would not be getting the fees overturned.Alas I was pushed out the door with not only my fees not overturned, but no straight answer as to why I was incurring these fees to begin with.Desired Settlement:  I would like the 5 additional fees overturned back into my account so icanclose it out and open a new account elsewhere.

RE: Letter to the Better Business Bureau

Dear Mr. Hill:

I am writing in response to your recent letter to the Better Business Bureau. I apologize for any frustration you may have experienced.

I have researched your concerns that you have outlined in your letter regarding the charges that were recently assessed to your Webster Checking account ending in 4346.

The Deposit Account Disclosures you received at account opening on July 25, 2013 outline our overdraft, fee, and posting order policies. By signing the signature card and use of the account, you agree to the terms and conditions of the account.

When your Visa Check Card is used for a purchase, funds are held and are no longer available for other transactions. These items are submitted by merchants for approval and will have a hold period, generally, of no more than three (3) business days for domestic transactions. We do not have access to any outstanding purchases and or debits you have not informed us of

Please keep in mind that fees are assessed the next business day after items post against insufficient/unavailable  funds.

On December 18, 2013 two(2) items; Walgreens Debit Card Purchase in the amount of
$8.49 and check number  138 in the amount of $90.00 were presented for payment against a balance of $6.39, resulting in a negative balance of $92.09. As a result, on December
19, 2013, two (2) Non Sufficient Funds Fees of $37.00, totaling $74.00 were assessed.

Additionally, on December 24, 2013 check number  139 in the amount of $208.00 was presented for payment against a balance of $46.47, resulting in a negative balance of
$161.53. On December 26, 2013 a Non Sufficient Funds Fee of $37.00 was assessed.
 



On January 2, 2014, an ATM deposit in the amount of $481.85 was processed bringing the account available balance to $116.00 and pending authorization holds in the amount of $63.32; Bonfish Grill in the amount of $57.38 and Dunkin Donuts in the amount of
$5.94 on January 2, 2014 reduced your available balance to $52.68. ATM deposits are not subject to immediate availability and the available balance is reflected on the receipt at the time of the deposit.

In addition, also on January 2, 2014, three (3) Debit Card purchases; Gulf in the amount of $55.00, and Gulf in the amount of $8.91, both made on December 31, 2013 and Experian in the amount of $9.99, made on January 1, 2014 posted to the account, resulting in a negative available balance of $21.22. As a result, three (3) items were presented against a negative available balance and on January 3, 2014 three (3) Non Sufficient Fund fees of $37.00, totaling $111.00 were assessed.

On January 6, 2014 a rebate in the amount of $37.00 was processed to your account. As a courtesy, I have credited your account an additional $74.00.

We recommend that transactions are written in your check register or an electronic equivalent, deducting the amounts of checks, ATM withdrawals, check card purchases and any ACH debits and bill payments as they occur. Your available balance is also available on ATM mini-statements, deposit receipts, our automated telephone banking system or on Webster Online. Please consider outstanding checks or other items in determining your true availability of funds.

Our online banking is a great way to keep track of your balance. We offer Balance Alerts via text message or e-mail so you will know when your balance has hit the "Low Balance" threshold that you've set. You can also call our Customer Care Center for assistance at ###-###-#### from 7:00 am to 10: pm, 7 days a week.

I have submitted your remarks to our Voice of the Customer programs which is reviewed by our executive management. If you have any further questions or concerns please contact me at ###-###-####.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
