Sciens, PVE Capital Team Up To Launch European Distressed Fund
Apr 14 2015  |  6:17am ET

Sciens Alternative Investments and PVE Capital have partnered to launch the PVE European Distressed Fund I, which will invest in a portfolio of Italian non-performing loans with a gross book value of €408 million.
PVE Capital is the originator of this deal, as well as being the asset manager of the NPL portfolio. PVE Capital is a European credit manager which has significant investment expertise in credit assets, ranging from traditional fundamental credit to the most esoteric structured credit. PVE Capital currently manages nearly $1 billion across six strategies.
Sciens Alternative Investments is part of the Sciens Capital Management Group whose global assets under management or advisory includes private equity, real assets, funds of hedge funds and managed account services. The fund is an Irish unit trust which has allowed a broad array of institutional investors to gain exposure to this investment opportunity.  Sciens is the fund manager for the PVE European Distressed Fund I, utilising its expertise in the real asset space.
“The Italian NPL market is of particular interest in 2015 as lenders are forced to restructure their balance sheets, with private investors offering the best solution in inefficient jurisdictions such as those found in southern Europe. Of all the NPL portfolios we have seen, what attracted us most about this particular transaction was its relatively low duration and the high quality of the collateral,” said Sciens founder and chief executive officer John Rigas. “We are excited about growing our relationship with PVE Capital, which has a proven record of sourcing opportunities and is becoming increasingly recognised as a major player in the European credit and structured credit space.”
Gennaro Pucci, chief investment officer and founder of PVE Capital added, “Our new portfolio is made up of high quality assets, and we are confident that this will generate attractive above average returns for our investors.”
This is the second recent venture between London and New York based Sciens Alternative Investments and London based PVE Capital, adding to an existing European structured credit managed account, SGAS Pearl Vega that was launched in September 2014 on Sciens’ independent Managed Account Platform and follows the PVE Special Situations Credit Strategy.
