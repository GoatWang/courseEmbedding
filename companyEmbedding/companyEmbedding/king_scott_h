Beautiful set. Very glad I ordered this, it even made our old brass bed look good! Good quality, soft, and generously sized. We'll have this set for many years. Thank you Scott Living and QVC

        love the mountains from
        soft but 2 pillows don't match very well
I've waited for years to buy a new bedding set for my master's bedroom and for some reason I chose this one. Probably because the Scott Brothers were so entertaining during their segment. This bedding set is very soft, no smell issues like others said at all. It is a light comforter which is perfect for this Montana home during the warmer months. The one issue I have with this is the two larger throw pillows do not really coordinate as they are more taupe and the rest of the set is more grey. I will not be using these and will look for more grey pillows to complement the rest of the set and the one pillow in front. Truly not a biggy but it would have been nice if the two pillows matched more exactly. Grey and taupe are not my idea of complementary colors. Thanks Scott Brothers though for this nice bedding set though!

        Absolutely beautiful!
I purchased the Biolan in the King size for a Queen size mattress. I have a thick featherbed and wanted the comforter to look like a bedspread. The fit is perfect. Living in the Southwest I wanted touches of turquoise and dark coral but I didn't want a true southwest design. The Biolan design is classy with just the right amount of color for accent. I was concerned the comforter may be too warm during the summer but with the air conditioning it's comfortable. I consider this a lightweight comforter and I'm happy with that because I hate having anything heavy on me while sleeping. I will not use the Navy throw pillows; the material is like a faux suede and doesn't look good with the set. The smaller pillow looks nice. I have white walls in my bedroom and the Biolan has a white background (hard to tell from the pictures) so this set looks like it was custom made for me. Thanks guys....good job!

        Nice but underwhelming
The comforter is very pretty. Material is thin. Will need to take it off at night as our dog sleeps with us. Has a funny smell but hope it goes away since it is now out of the plastic.

        it's ok
The comforter's fabric is very thin. If you have a dog that lays on the bed don't get it, I am sure it will rip. I love the colors and wanted something very colorful for Summer. I was excited to get throw pillows with it but the navy background does not go with any color in the comforter. I am not using them on the bed. Yes I am a Libra and like things balanced lol! I am not sending it back but not very thrilled about it. I guess I expected more with these guys name on it but then again I guess I would be paying more too.

        Great Coverlet
Love the fabric and design, I just ordered a second color, taupe to go with the coral TSV sheets. The Seaglass works well with the lattice sheets. I too am disappointed in the shams, hoping they were quilted as well - the zipper is difficult to use. It is hard to find a good quality coverlet !

        Perfect Beautiful Coverlet
I ordered the coverlet in two colors to see which one I like better with the Seattle bedding from the Scott brothers (Which is absolutely gorgeous by the way). I got the creamy white and seablue green. Love them both but think I will keep the creamy white. I would love to keep both but can't justify doing that. The seablue green coverlet is gorgeous but doesn't exactly match the bedding as it does on the video the way I would like it too. I know you don't have to match exactly but I kind of like to. Plus my curtains are white so it ties it all together. The coverlets are fabulous quality and look expensive like hotel bedding but better. I'm now a bigger Scott brothers fan. I have ordered their comforter, coverlet, sheets and towels and all high quality at much less cost. Doing the Happy Dance for the Scott brothers!

        Shams
Received the sea glass coverlet and shams. I have a California king size bed and got the king size coverlet set and to my surprise it fit beautifully on my bed and around the sides, it's very generous. All the other coverlet sets that I've purchased in the past barely cover the sides of my bed. The shams are not quilted as the bed coverlet. They feel very much like a pillow case that's why I gave it minus one star. The cases for the pillow come with a zipper on the top or bottom depending on how you place it on the bed and it's not noticeable. They glide over nicely but you need to use both hands one to hold the other to zip. I understand that these are pillow shams but was expecting it to match the coverlet quilt at least on one side.

Super XII Troubleshooting & Alignment

I've spent several days working on a particularly difficult chassis and learned something I thought I'd share. First, here is what I had to start with: A nice single chassis Super XII. The IF aligned beautifully, and the 3 SW bands also aligned "by the book". The set sounded great on any SW band, AM was basically dead. There are only 3 things that are AM only, so I verified each coil. While checking continuity on the oscillator coil, I happened to notice that the 1K resistor seemed to move a… Continue

EH Scott Model 510 Tuner Service Manual/Alignment

I came into a 510 Tuner recently and have renewed the caps and resistors as necessary.  I have the schematic for the Tuner and also the Power Supply/Audio Amp.  I built my own power supply/amp with 6L6s and a 6SN7 and diode rectification because one did not come with the tuner.  Now I need the alignment instructions for the tuner or better yet, the Service Manual.  Would anyone out there have a .pdf that would help??  Thanks very much, best, Steve

This engaging biography of Coretta Scott King, an important Civil Rights Activist, is an ideal addition to Women Who Broke the Rules, with full-color illustrations, and, in the vein of Jean Fritz's series, perfect for Common Core. Many awe-inspiring women have changed the course of history. From fighting for social justice and women's rights to discovering and shaping our country, women have left a lasting mark on our past, present, and future. But it's not easy to affect change, and these women didn't always play by the rules to make a difference! Kathleen Krull blends history and humor in this delightful young biography series.Coretta Scott King played a vital role in the Civil Rights movement. She gave concerts to raise funds and awareness for her causes, winning people's hearts with music in addition to marches, politics, or demonstrations. After MLK Jr.'s assassination Coretta kept on marching and stepped in to fill his shoes, at first using his words to carry on the work, and then finding her own.SpecificationsNumber of Pages48Original LanguagesEnglishSubjectKING, CORETTA SCOTT, 1927-2006, KING, CORETTA SCOTT, 1927-2006_JUVENILE LITERATURE, KING, MARTIN LUTHER, JR., 1929-1968, KING, MARTIN LUTHER, JR., 1929-1968_JUVENILE LITERATUREAuthorKrull, KathleenTarget AudienceJSeries TitleWomen Who Broke the Rules Ser.PublisherBloomsbury Publishing USAPublication DateJanuary, 1970ISBN-130802738265ISBN-102738264Show moreQuestions & Answers0 questionGet specific details about this product from customers who own it.BackQuestions & AnswersNo question have been asked yet.

New Thinking about Propositions
Jeffrey C. King, Scott Soames, and Jeff Speaks


Three leading philosophers of language present rival views on the nature of propositions
The starting-point for all future work on this topic








New Thinking about Propositions
Jeffrey C. King, Scott Soames, and Jeff Speaks



Description



Philosophy (especially philosophy of language and philosophy of mind), science (especially linguistics and cognitive science), and common sense all sometimes make reference to propositions--understood as the things we believe and say, and the things which are (primarily) true or false. There is, however, no widespread agreement about what sorts of things these entities are. In  New Thinking about Propositions, Jeffrey C. King, Scott Soames, and Jeff Speaks argue that commitment to propositions is indispensable, and that traditional accounts of propositions are inadequate. They each then defend their own views of the nature of propositions.

Reviews and Awards


"Overall, the book is a splendid contribution to the field, and does genuinely offer 'new thinking' about the perennially problematic status of propositions." -- The Philosophical Quarterly
