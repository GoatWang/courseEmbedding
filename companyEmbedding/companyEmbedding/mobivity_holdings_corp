Introducing SmartAnalytics





SmartAnalytics is a POS-agnostic platform that allows brands, agencies, and franchisees to quickly and easily unlock key sales and redemption data in real-time. Use this data to predict results and influence consumer behavior to measure performance and accelerate revenue.






  








  












Real-Time Makes a Real Difference

SmartAnalytics gives you access to the data immediately so you can spot trends and take action, saving valuable time and money.






  








  












Built for Scale





Our solution is a straightforward POS-agnostic approach that enables us to capture your data regardless of what system you use. And because SmartAnalytics provides transaction-level data, it’s easy to drill down to the store-level to better understand business performance across locations, and quickly affect changes that improve your bottom line.






  








  












Instant Access From Anywhere





Accessing SmartAnalytics is a cinch – and, it’s built for sharing with anyone you choose. Mobivity’s secure cloud-based dashboards can be accessed from anywhere. Empower your managers, agencies, partners, and executives to see some or all of the data available.

Ziplocal and Mobivity To Provide Revenue-Producing Mobile Marketing Solutions To Local Businesses

By MobivityJanuary 9, 2014 No Comments










PROVO, Utah and PHOENIX –  Jan. 9, 2014 – Ziplocal announced an agreement to sell Mobivity’s mobile marketing services throughout the United States. Ziplocal, based in Provo, UT, is a privately-held, print and digital local search services company operating in 290 communities in 33 states. Mobivity Holdings Corp. (MFON) is an award-winning provider of proprietary and patented mobile marketing technologies and solutions.
Ziplocal’s 50,000 clients now have access to Mobivity’s leading technology platform that drives sales, engagement, and loyalty. Furthermore, Ziplocal intends to offer Mobivity services, which it is calling ZipLoyalty, to all businesses in each of its 290 markets. It also will sell Mobivity services throughout the United States through its 120 person inside and outside sales force.
Initially, Ziplocal will sell two Mobivity products:

ZipLoyalty is a cost-effective text/smartphone marketing solution. With ZipLoyalty, local businesses will build and market goods and services to loyal customers using opt-in databases to drive incremental sales.
Mobivity’s innovative Stampt smartphone loyalty application replaces paper stamp cards commonly found at small business locations.

Ziplocal also licensed Mobivity’s patented system for using telephone numbers as a key to mobile subscriber information without the use of a look-up database. Using this system, the telecom and mobile marketing industry can access key mobile subscriber information to perform various tasks such as routing SMS text messages to the correct carrier network.
“As we enter 2014, it’s more critical than ever that local businesses mobilize!  Especially when wireless penetration in the United States exceeds 100 percent,” said Jennifer Nielson, Ziplocal Director of Digital Product Strategy. “ZipLoyalty is a key element in Ziplocal’s digital growth strategy.  Because SMS text messages are read 95 percent of the time within four minutes by consumers, businesses have tremendous opportunity to connect with customers with immediate results, and the Stampt loyalty product will have mobile users returning to our clients’ locations to make purchases more than ever before.”
“Mobivity’s mission is to offer solutions to small businesses that will allow them to bring more customers more often,” said Dennis Becker, Mobivity Chairman and CEO. “We’re pleased to team with Ziplocal, a leader in its commitment to its customers in changed media consumption times.”
About Mobivity
Mobivity is an award-winning provider of a suite of patented mobile marketing technologies that drive sales, enhance customer engagement, and reward customer loyalty for local businesses and national brands. Its solutions, including an industry-leading text messaging product and innovative StamptTM mobile loyalty application, enable businesses across the United States to drive incremental business and profitability by quickly and effectively communicating discounts and special offers to their most loyal customers. Additionally, Mobivity offers a unique, high definition graphical system platform that allows its clients to enhance customer or fan experience by interacting with their mobile phones and video boards or screens in real time. Mobivity’s clients include national brands such as CNN, Disney, the NFL, Sony Pictures, AT&T, Chick-fil-A, the Golf Channel, NBC Universal, and numerous professional sports teams, as well as thousands of small, local businesses across the U.S. For more information, visit www.mobivity.com.
About Ziplocal

With a dedicated on-the-ground sales force, combined with telephone sales and support, Ziplocal currently reaches more than 290 U.S. markets in 33 states. Rich and relevant local content with a strong focus on interactive and immersive media sets the company’s mobile applications and local search site apart from other search sites.

Mobivity Expands Leadership With Proven Sales & Marketing Executives
Jul 10, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
PHOENIX, July  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mobivity Holdings Corp. (OTCQB:MFON), the award-winning platform for intelligent and personalized marketing in the real world, has added two key members to its executive team. Corey O’Donnell and Mark Armstrong have joined Mobivity to lead marketing and sales functions respectively, empowering the company to expand its reach and continue to innovate on behalf of national brands.
Prior to joining Mobivity, O’Donnell and Armstrong both worked for the “Brand Networks” dedicated group within Yodle, and helped franchise brands create a more unified and coordinated marketing strategy through the revolutionary Centermark platform. Mr. O’Donnell spearheaded the conception, creation, and marketing strategy of Yodle’s Centermark platform, and helped to nurture it from idea to market-leading solution. Mr. Armstrong oversaw sales and account management functions, and was a driving force behind the exceptional growth Centermark achieved in the franchise marketplace. Centermark’s success helping network businesses unify, scale, and optimize their marketing performance ultimately helped to drive Yodle’s acquisition by Web.com in 2016. Given Mobivity’s already proven success with franchise networks, and their progress toward a data-driven platform for optimized marketing, the synergies in these new hires is self-evident. “Mobivity is a tremendously exciting opportunity,” said Corey O’Donnell, SVP of Marketing at Mobivity. “My career has been focused on developing and communicating technology breakthroughs that can have a positive impact on our lives and businesses. The unique technologies, influential brands, and incredible talent at Mobivity represent a superb basis, and I’m thrilled to leverage my experience to help shape their platform and serve customers together.” The hire of these two key players illustrates both Mobivity’s continued growth, as well as their commitment to serving national brands. O’Donnell and Armstrong have already been crafting new strategies for product positioning, branding, technology innovation, market awareness, sales, and customer support. Mr. Armstrong, as SVP of Sales for Mobivity, is also in charge of bolstering the company’s client support teams. “Mobivity is focused on building a team of talent to better support their customers by bringing new ideas and strategies into the business model,” said Armstrong. “I couldn’t be happier to join this team at this time; we have a tremendous opportunity ahead and I believe we can delight our customers and achieve significant growth.” “Adding Mark and Corey to the team is a strategic move,” said Dennis Becker, CEO at Mobivity. “As we grow, we are focusing on national and franchise brands in which Corey and Mark have both thrived in the past. They will bring tighter focus to our franchise platform development, new ideas for products, and a passion for serving customers in the space.” Corey O’Donnell enters the role of Senior Vice President of Marketing for Mobivity with over 20 years’ experience in marketing, sales, and product innovation for enterprise-focused software and technology solutions. Corey is responsible for all aspects of the strategy, positioning, and communications of the Mobivity platform. Mark Armstrong has extensive knowledge of building and leading successful sales organizations for innovative SaaS companies. As Senior Vice President of Sales at Mobivity, Mark is focused on building and nurturing a pipeline of corporate and franchise brands that benefit from providing their customers with intelligent and personalized marketing, and with managing the ongoing support and strategic growth of those customers. Fusing both responsibilities ensures that Mobivity lives up to its performance promises on behalf of all customers. About Mobivity Mobivity provides a platform for intelligent and personalized marketing in the real world. Real world customer activity in national restaurants, retailers, and personal care brands is difficult to track and connect to digital actions. Mobivity leverages detailed purchase data and communications platforms to improve business results by understanding, predicting, and influencing consumer behavior. We drive better actions and inform decisions by connecting point of sale outcomes to the events and influences that caused them.
