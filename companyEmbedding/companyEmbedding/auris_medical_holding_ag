HomeInner Ear DisordersHearing loss















															Hearing loss									

Hearing loss may be either due to insufficient sound conduction from the outer to the inner ear ("conductive hearing loss"), or - much more frequently - to damage to the hair cells and neurons in the cochlea or to the auditory nerve ("sensorineural hearing loss").
Hearing loss may develop slowly over many years or set in acutely, e.g. following some noise or head trauma or due to some ototoxic medication (e.g. certain chemotherapy drugs or antibiotics). Sometimes the precise origin of acute hearing loss is unknown or may only be suspected such as case of idiopathic sudden deafness. Here, the source may be some infection, disruption in blood supply or autoimmune disorder.
While sensorineural hearing loss in the chronic stage is irreversible, all or part of it may recover in the acute stage thanks to cochlear repair mechanisms. The more severe the acute hearing loss is, the less likely spontaneous recovery becomes and the higher the risk for permanent damage and loss is. Usually, hearing recovery is most pronounced in the hours and days following the onset of acute hearing loss and tapering off over 4 to 5 weeks. In human beings, loss of cochlear hair cells or neurons is irreversible.
Chronic hearing loss may have serious impacts on professional and personal lives, e.g. through reduced job performance and earning power, impaired memory and ability to learn new tasks or reduced alertness and increased risk to personal safety (loss of monitoring of environmental warning sounds).

HomeInner Ear Disorders Menière’s Disease















															Menière’s Disease									

Menière's Disease is a disorder with various fluctuating symptoms: vertigo or strong dizziness, tinnitus, hearing loss and the sensation of pressure or pain in the affected ear. Menière's Disease usually breaks out suddenly, affects most often only one ear, and can arise daily or as infrequently as once a year.
Typically, the attack is characterized by a combination of vertigo, tinnitus and hearing loss lasting several hours, with frequencies, durations and intensities of the discomforts varying from patient to patient. Periodic attacks of vertigo (or dizziness) are the most disruptive symptom to the patient. It occurs in the form of a series of attacks over a period of weeks or months and produces nystagamus, nausea, vomiting, sweating and all the symptoms usually associated with extreme motion sickness.
Hearing tends to recover between attacks, but over time it becomes worse. Overall, Menière's Disease is a progressive disease.

															Keyzilen® (AM-101)									

“key-ZYE-lin”Keyzilen® for the treatment of acute inner ear tinnitusAuris Medical is developing Keyzilen® for the treatment of acute inner ear (peripheral) tinnitus following traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media (middle ear infection). Keyzilen® contains Esketamine hydrochloride, an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, formulated in a biocompatible and fully biodegradable gel. It is administered in one treatment cycle, comprising three intratympanic injections over 3 to 5 days into the middle ear. From there the drug diffuses through the so-called round window membrane into the cochlea.Keyzilen® has the potential to be the first drug to gain approval for treating acute inner ear tinnitus. How Keyzilen® worksAcoustic trauma and other insults to the inner ear may trigger increased levels of extra-cellular glutamate, which in turn cause excessive activation of cochlear NMDA receptors. This process results in damage or killing of sensory cells and is thought to be responsible for abnormal spontaneous "firing" of auditory nerves, which may be perceived as tinnitus. Under normal circumstances, the NMDA receptors are thought to play no role in fast excitatory neurotransmission, respectively normal hearing. Keyzilen® is blocking cochlear NMDA receptors to suppress the aberrant excitation of the auditory nerve that is perceived as tinnitus. Development stage Keyzilen® is currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Keyzilen Fact SheetOngoing clinical trial: TACTT3 TACTT2 trial featured in „Tinnitus Today“ of the American Tinnitus Association Corporate Symposium at AAO-HNSF Annual Meeting 2014 in Orlando

Auris Medical Holding AG Key Developments

Auris Medical Completes Enrollment of Phase 3 HEALOS Trial of AM-111 for the Treatment of Sudden Deafness
Jul 5 17
Auris Medical Holding AG announced that it has completed patient enrollment in the Phase 3 HEALOS clinical trial of AM-111 in idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSNHL), also known as sudden deafness. Top-line results from the HEALOS trial are expected in the fall of 2017. The HEALOS trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of single-dose intratympanic administration of AM-111. The trial is being conducted in several European and Asian countries and has enrolled patients who are suffering from severe to profound ISSNHL within 72 hours from onset. Patients were randomized to receive AM-111 0.4 mg/mL, 0.8 mg/mL or placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The primary efficacy endpoint for the trial is the improvement of pure tone hearing thresholds from baseline to Day 28. HEALOS is the first of two pivotal trials in Auris Medical's Phase 3 clinical development program for AM-111. The second Phase 3 trial, ASSENT, is set to enroll approximately 300 patients. Auris Medical expects to announce top-line results from the ASSENT trial in the second half of 2018.

					Full Description



Auris Medical Holding AG, incorporated on April 15, 1998, is a holding and clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of products for the treatment of inner ear disorders. The Company's advanced product candidate, AM-101, is in Phase III clinical development for acute inner ear tinnitus under a special protocol assessment (SPA) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In approximately two Phase II clinical trials, AM-101 demonstrated a favorable safety profile and significant improvement in tinnitus loudness and other patient reported outcomes. The Company's second product candidate, AM-111, is being developed for the treatment of acute sensorineural hearing loss (ASNHL). In its Phase II clinical trial, AM-111 showed a favorable safety profile.The Company intends to conduct over two pivotal Phase III trials in the treatment of idiopathic sudden SNHL (ISSNHL), titled Acute Inner Ear Hearing Loss (HEALOS) and Acute Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss Treatment (ASSENT). AM-111 received orphan drug designation for the treatment of ASNHL from both the United States Food and Drug Administration, and the European Union agency (EMA). In addition, it intends to conduct a Phase II trial in the treatment of surgery-induced hearing loss (REACH) in the United States. The Company's product candidates are injected under local anesthesia into the middle ear by a technique called intratympanic injection. Once injected into the middle ear, the active substance, which is formulated in a biocompatible gel, diffuses into the inner ear.AM-101The Company's Esketamine is a small molecule non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. AM-101 is formulated in a biocompatible gel and delivered through intratympanic injection. It has initiated approximately two pivotal clinical trials with similar design, in North America (Treatment of Acute Inner Ear Tinnitus 2 (TACTT2)) and in Europe, which it refers to as TACTT3. It has conducted the first clinical evaluation of AM-101 in a Phase I/II double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that included dose escalation from 0.03 to 0.81 microgram/microliter (mg/mL). This first clinical trial showed that single doses of intratympanically administered AM-101 were well tolerated up to the highest tested dose of approximately 0.81 mg/mL. Only small traces of Esketamine and its primary metabolite were detected in blood samples within the first hours following treatment administration.The Company has conducted over two multi-center Phase II trials, one in Europe (TACTT0) and the other in Europe and the United States (which it refers to as TACTT1). TACTT0 trial was a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, multiple dose, parallel group, Phase II clinical trial. It has enrolled patients with persistent inner ear tinnitus as a result of acute acoustic trauma (AAT), otitis media (OM) or ISSNHL, occurring for approximately three months prior, and with a minimum masking level (MML) of approximately five decibel (dB). TACTT1, its second double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial, was conducted in the United States, Belgium, Germany and Poland.AM-111AM-111 contains a synthetic D-form peptide (D-JNKI-1) that acts as a c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) ligand, thereby protecting sensorineural structures in the inner ear from stress-induced damage. The Company is developing D-JNKI-1 for the treatment of ear disorders. AM-111 is delivered in a biocompatible gel formulation through intratympanic injection. It has established the safety and preliminary efficacy of AM-111 in a Phase II clinical trial. The Company is preparing for the late-stage clinical development of AM-111 in acute inner ear hearing loss.
