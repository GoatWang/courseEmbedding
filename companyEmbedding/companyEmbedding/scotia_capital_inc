Koskie Minsky LLP and Siskinds LLP Announce Court Approve $32.5 Million Settlement with Underwriters in Sino-Forest Class Action
Nov 11 15
Siskinds LLP and Koskie Minsky LLP, class counsel in the Sino-Forest class action, announced that the Ontario Superior Court of Justice has approved a CAD 32.5 million settlement with Credit Suisse Securities (Canada), Inc., TD Securities Inc., Dundee Securities Corporation, RBC Dominion Securities Inc., Scotia Capital Inc., CIBC World Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., Canaccord Financial Ltd., Maison Placements Canada Inc., Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (collectively, the Underwriters). The Underwriters were various financial institutions that served as underwriters in one or more of Sino-Forest's public offerings of shares and notes. On October 30, 2015, Regional Senior Justice Geoffrey Morawetz made an order approving this historic settlement. The settlement agreement provides for the Underwriters to pay CAD 32.5 million in settlement of all claims arising from their dealings with Sino-Forest. The class action alleges that Sino-Forest, certain of its directors and officers, auditors and underwriters misled investors concerning the business and accounting at the collapsed timber trader. The plaintiffs include The Trustees of the Labourers' Pension Fund of Central and Eastern Canada and The Trustees of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 793 Pension Plan for Operating Engineers in Ontario. Siskinds' securities class actions team is complemented by lawyers in Siskinds' affiliate, Siskinds, Desmeules, based in Quebec City.


Scotia Capital Announces Executive Changes
Nov 9 15
David Skurka is no longer at Scotia Capital, ending a nearly 14-year run with the dealer. Mr. Skurka's departure comes at a time of year when turnover on Bay Street is common. To replace Mr. Skurka, Scotiabank has named Charles Emond and Dany Beauchemin as coheads of global investment banking. The two men currently run the diversified industries group together and will continue to do so in their new roles. Under new leaders, Scotiabank is keen on expanding its financial institutions group in Canada, the United States and Latin America. The bank is searching for a new group head to oversee this growth.
