 We’re radically changing the way vascular disease is treated





Our Story
Vascular disease isn’t going away. Real people continue to fight the progression and complications that result from PAD. We’ve won many battles but the war goes on and we don’t take our responsibility to create change lightly. As our company ages, many of our ideas have become realities yet we still lie awake at night devising plans to do more. We know many are counting on us to do more. We continue to be an ordinary group of individuals trying to achieve the extraordinary. For this opportunity we remain extremely blessed.

                                            Dr. John Simpson has revolutionized the field of medicine through innovations that have fundamentally altered how physicians treat cardiovascular disease. He invented and commercialized the first over-the-wire balloon catheter used for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). This single idea created the field of interventional cardiology as we know it today. Dr. Simpson’s unique approach to patient care and the success of less invasive interventional techniques, specifically PTCA, have generated a multi-disciplinary shift in medicine as ophthalmologists, radiologists, cardiologists, neurologists and surgeons alike have adopted this technique.

Dr. Simpson has a unique ability to recognize unmet clinical needs, generate concepts to address these needs, and transform these concepts into clinically and commercially relevant products. Dr. Simpson has started several companies dedicated to providing patients with the most cutting-edge therapies in a variety of different areas, including directional atherectomy (coronary and peripheral), chronic total occlusions (CTOs), ultrasound, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, suture-mediated vascular closure, and local drug delivery. His companies have sold for +$1.7 billion in aggregate, and include Advanced Cardiovascular Systems (sold to Eli Lilly in 1981 for stock on an earnout basis), Devices for Vascular Intervention (acquired by Eli Lilly in 1990), Perclose (purchased by Abbott in 1999), and FoxHollow Technologies (merged with ev3 in 2007).

Dr. Simpson received his PhD in Immunology from the University of Texas and his MD from Duke University. He completed his fellowship in interventional cardiology at Stanford University. Dr. Simpson is a member of the American College of Physicians and a fellow of the American College of Cardiology. He has published extensively on a wide variety of subjects and lectured throughout the world 01.

Avinger Announces Verified Data of 24-Month Outcomes from the Pivotal VISION Study of Lumivascular Technology for Peripheral Artery Disease
May 31 17
Avinger, Inc. announced positive two-year clinical data from the pivotal VISION study of the company’s Lumivascular™ technology. The VISION study was designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Avinger’s Pantheris® system to perform directional atherectomy while, for the first time ever, allowing physicians to use real-time intravascular imaging to aid in the removal of plaque from diseased lower extremity arteries. Data from the study, which demonstrated successful achievement of all primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints, supported U.S. Food and Drug (FDA) 510(k) clearance of the system in 2016. Twenty four (24) month follow-up results from 89 patients were presented by Patrick Muck, M.D., Chief of Vascular Surgery at Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, at New Cardiovascular Horizons (NCVH) in New Orleans, Louisiana. This includes an additional 34 patients beyond the interim data set presented on January 25, 2017. Data presented remain subject to adjustment based on final statistical analysis and review by the study’s clinical events committee.


Avinger Receives Non-Compliance Notice From NASDAQ
May 31 17
On May 24, 2017, Avinger, Inc. (Company) received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC (NASDAQ) notifying the Company that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), as the minimum bid price for the Company’s listed securities was less than $1 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. This letter also informed the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), as the market value of the Company’s publicly held shares (MVPHS) was less than $15,000,000 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. The Company has a period of 180 calendar days, or until November 20, 2017, to regain compliance with the rules referred to in this paragraph. To regain compliance, during the 180 day period, the bid price of the Company’s common stock must close at $1 or more and/or the Company’s MVPHS must close at $15 million or more, in each case for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The notice has no present impact on the listing of the Company’s securities on NASDAQ. In the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules prior to the expiration of the compliance period, it will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company may appeal the delisting determination to a hearings panel pursuant to the procedures set forth in the applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Company intends to actively monitor its bid price and MVPHS and will consider available options to resolve the deficiencies and regain compliance with the Nasdaq Listing Rules, including conducting a reverse stock split and applying to transfer to the NASDAQ Capital Market, which has a minimum MVPHS requirement of $1 million.


Rosen Law Firm Files Class Action Lawsuit Against Avinger, Inc
May 23 17
Rosen Law Firm announced the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of the common stock of Avinger, Inc. in or traceable to Avinger’s January 30, 2015 initial public offering. The lawsuit seeks to recover damages for Avinger investors under the federal securities laws. According to the lawsuit, the documents filed in connection with the IPO contained materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: Avinger did not have adequate sales and marketing personnel to increase sales of its lumivascular platform products and to commercialize Pantheris; Avinger had already experienced problems with the robustness of its lumivascular platform devices, including Pantheris; physicians and hospitals were requiring more extensive and comprehensive training and education on the benefits of Avinger’s products to convince them to adopt and implement Avinger’s lumivascular platform products compared to competing products and procedures available in the market; in turn, Avinger would not be able to achieve a rapid ramp rate for increased sales of its lumivascular platform; and as a result, Avinger was experiencing lower sales and revenues. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.

					Full Description



Avinger, Inc., incorporated on March 8, 2007, is a commercial-stage medical device company. The Company designs, manufactures and sells image-guided, catheter-based systems that are used by physicians to treat patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). The Company focuses on introducing products based on its lumivascular platform, which is an intravascular image-guided system. The Company manufactures and sells a suite of products in the United States and select European markets. The Company's products include Lightbox imaging console, as well as its Wildcat, Kittycat and the Ocelot family of catheters, which are designed to allow physicians to penetrate a total blockage in an artery, known as a chronic total occlusion (CTO). The lumivascular platform offers real-time visualization of the inside of the artery during PAD treatment. The lumivascular platform consists of a capital component Lightbox and a range of disposable catheter products, including Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL, Ocelot MVRX and Pantheris.The Company is developing Pantheris, its image-guided atherectomy device, which is designed to allow physicians to remove arterial plaque in PAD patients. The Company has completed enrollment of over 130 patients in VISION, a clinical trial for its Pantheris atherectomy device. The Company's products include Lightbox console and various catheters used in PAD treatment. The lumivascular platform integrates optical coherence tomography (OCT) visualization with interventional catheters and provides real-time intravascular imaging during the treatment portion of PAD procedures.LightboxLightbox is an imaging console, which enables the use of lumivascular catheters during PAD procedures. The console contains an optical transceiver that transmits light into the artery through an optical fiber and displays a cross-sectional image of the vascular tissue to the physician on a monitor during the procedure. Lightbox is configured with monitors for the physicians and for the Lightbox technician. Lightbox displays a cross-sectional view of the vessel, which provides physicians with detailed information about the orientation of the catheter and the surrounding artery and plaque. Layered structures represent relatively healthy portions of the artery and non-layered structures represent the plaque that is blocking blood flow in the artery. Navigational markers allow the physician to orient the catheter toward the treatment area, helping to avoid damage to the black line during a procedure.PantherisPantheris is a single-use product and provides physicians with the ability to see a cross-sectional view of the artery throughout the procedure. The device restores blood flow by shaving thin strips of plaque using a directional cutting mechanism that specifically targets the portion of the artery where the plaque resides while minimizing disruption to the arterial structures. The excised plaque is deposited in the nosecone of the device and removed from the artery. The physicians advance Pantheris to the diseased portion of the vessel using fluoroscopy prior to activating the cutting tip. The OCT image provides the physician with a cross-sectional view of the treatment site and the relative orientation of the cutter. Visual cues are used to orient the cutting mechanism to target diseased sections of the artery, and the plaque is removed by activating the cutter and advancing the catheter through the blockage. A balloon beneath the cutter is inflated to move the catheter closer to the plaque, enabling the physician to stabilize the device and adjust the cut depth into the plaque as necessary. Multiple cuts can be made with the same device until sufficient plaque has been removed to restore adequate blood flow in the artery.Ocelot, Ocelot PIXL and Ocelot MVRXOcelot is a CTO crossing catheter to integrate real-time OCT imaging, which allows physicians to see the inside of an artery during a CTO crossing procedure. Ocelot allows physicians to navigate through CTOs by utilizing the OCT images to guide the device through the arterial blockage, while minimizing disruption to the arterial structures. Ocelot has a corkscrew-like tip that rotates to facilitate advancement of the catheter through a CTO. Marker bands are displayed on the OCT image and allow the tip of the catheter to be steered towards the blockage and away from the arterial wall as it moves through the blockage. Once through the blockage, a guidewire can be extended and Ocelot is removed, leaving the wire in place for additional therapies, such as the use of an atherectomy catheter like Pantheris. The Company also offers Ocelot PIXL, a lower profile CTO-crossing device for below-the-knee arteries, and Ocelot MVRX, which offers a different tip design for above-the-knee arteries.Other ProductsThe Company's CTO-crossing catheters, Wildcat and Kittycat 2, employ a design that uses a rotational spinning technique, allowing the physician to switch between passive and active mode when navigating across a CTO. Once across the CTO, Wildcat and Kittycat 2 allow for placement of a guidewire and removal of the catheter while leaving the wire in place for additional therapies. Both products require the use of fluoroscopy rather than the lumivascular platform for imaging.The Company competes with Abbott Laboratories, Cardinal Health, CR Bard, Boston Scientific, Cook Medical, Medtronic, Cardiovascular Systems, Philips and Spectranetics.
