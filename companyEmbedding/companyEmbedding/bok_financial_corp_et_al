Exhibit 99 (a)NASD: BOKF For Further Information Contact: Joseph CrivelliInvestor Relations (918) 595-3027BOK Financial Reports Annual and Quarterly Earnings for 2016TULSA, Okla. (Wednesday, January 25, 2017) - BOK Financial Corporation reported net income of $232.7 million or $3.53 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $288.6 million or $4.21 per diluted share. Net income for fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $50.0 million or $0.76 per diluted share. Unusual items that impacted fourth quarter earnings included:•A $17.0 million decrease in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, which reduced earnings per share (EPS) by $0.18 per share; and a $5.0 million decrease in the net fair value of trading portfolio positions, which reduced EPS by $0.05 per share. Both of these items were a result of the unexpected 85 basis point increase in the 10-year U.S. Treasury interest rate and related interest rates primarily due to the market's reaction to the outcome of the presidential election. •Expenses related to the completion of the Mobank acquisition totaled $4.7 million or $0.05 per share.•Severance and other expenses related to the fourth quarter staff reductions totaled $5.0 million or $0.05 per share.Steven G. Bradshaw, president and chief executive officer, noted, “In 2016 we achieved record net interest income and fees and commissions revenue, generated strong loan growth despite a significant reduction in energy loan outstandings, and worked through a protracted commodities downturn with performance near the top of our peer group of energy banks. We also completed the acquisition of MBT Bancshares (Mobank) in Kansas City and are already capitalizing on our opportunities in that important growth market. Finally, we adjusted our mortgage servicing rights hedging strategy to reduce volatility in a rising rate environment going forward. While the impact of changing interest rates, expense items associated with the Mobank acquisition, and other unusual expense items reduced profitability, I am as confident in our business prospects today as I have been in years. We believe we are well-positioned to continue to grow revenues and energize earnings growth in 2017.”1

Bok Financial Et Al's Comment on Competitors and Industry Peers  

BOK Financial and its operating segments face competition from other banks, 
  thrifts, credit unions and other non-bank financial institutions, such as investment 
  banking firms, investment advisory firms, brokerage firms, investment companies, 
  government agencies, mortgage brokers and insurance companies. The Company competes 
  largely on the basis of customer services, interest rates on loans and deposits, 
  lending limits and customer convenience. Some operating segments face competition 
  from institutions that are not as closely regulated as banks, and therefore 
  are not limited by the same capital requirements and other restrictions. 
We are the largest financial institution in the state of Oklahoma with 15% 
  of the state’s total deposits. Bank of Oklahoma has 32% and 13% of the 
  market share in the Tulsa and Oklahoma City areas, respectively. We compete 
  with two banks that have operations nationwide and have greater access to funds 
  at lower costs, higher lending limits, and greater access to technology resources. 
  We also compete with regional and locally-owned banks in both the Tulsa and 
  Oklahoma City areas, as well as in every other community in which we do business 
  throughout the state.
Bank of Texas competes against numerous financial institutions, including some 
  of the largest in the United States, and has a market share of approximately 
  2% in the Dallas, Fort Worth area and less than 1% in the Houston area. Bank 
  of Albuquerque has a number four market share position with 9% of deposits in 
  the Albuquerque area and competes with four large national banks, some regional 
  banks and several locally-owned smaller community banks. Colorado State Bank 
  and Trust has a market share of approximately 2% in the Denver area. Bank of 
  Arkansas serves Benton and Washington counties in Arkansas with a market share 
  of approximately 4%. Bank of Arizona operates as a community bank with locations 
  in Phoenix, Mesa and Scottsdale with a market share of approximately 1%. Bank 
  of Kansas City serves the Kansas City, Kansas/Missouri market with a market 
  share of approximately 2%. The Company’s ability to expand into additional 
  states remains subject to various federal and state laws.

 Forward-Looking Statements: This presentation contains statements that are based on management’s
 beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates, and projections about BOK Financial Corporation, the
 financial services industry, and the economy generally. These remarks constitute forward-looking statements
 within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “anticipates”,
 “believes”, “estimates”, “expects”, “forecasts”, “plans”, “projects”, variations of such words, and similar
 expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management judgments relating to,
 and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses involve judgments as to future events and are
 inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments that BOK Financial’s acquisitions and other growth
 endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events, based in
 part on information provided by others which BOKF has not independently verified. These statements are not
 guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which are difficult
 to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and
 outcomes may materially differ from what is expressed, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking
 statements. Internal and external factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to,
 changes in interest rates and interest rate relationships, demand for products and services, the degree of
 competition by traditional and non-traditional competitors, changes in banking regulations, tax laws, prices,
 levies, and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as
 their ability to repay loans. For a discussion of risk factors that may cause actual results to differ from
 expectations, please refer to BOK Financial Corporation’s most recent annual and quarterly reports. BOK
 Financial Corporation and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking
 statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.

  Our pre-downturn expectations (from 12/31/14 earnings conference call):
  “We believe the highest near term risk in energy lending is in two areas - energy services and 
second lien or ‘B’ tranches of loans.” 
 “We see two distinct risk periods…If commodity prices take less than a year to return to a 
normalized, stable level, we will see some credits migrate to problem loans, but few if any 
material losses in the portfolio. The spillover impact on the overall economy in our footprint will 
be manageable.”
  If the downturn does NOT behave like (previous downturns), longer term outcomes are 
obviously more difficult to predict. At that point, we would be more likely to see loss content in 
the portfolio and a greater impact on the overall economy, and in turn lower loan demand 
across the business.”

 The Energy Downturn of 2014-2016: 
A Retrospective
  What happened?
  The downturn lasted over two years
  There was no noticeable “spillover effect” in oil-dependent states
  BOKF experienced only one material loss of $21.6 million out of a pre-downturn portfolio of 
over 600 borrowers
  BOKF experienced total cumulative losses of $36.6 million or 1.5 percent of 12/31/14 
outstandings
  BOKF was consistently #1 or #2 in terms of credit performance among energy banks all 
throughout the downturn

 The Energy Downturn of 2014-2016: 
12 Lessons Learned
 1. Portfolio composition mattered
 2. SNCs generally performed better 
than non-SNCs
 3. Large E&P borrowers performed 
better than small E&P borrowers
 4. First lien senior secured positions 
did not get equitized
 5. Wide-scale drawdowns on lines of 
credit did not occur
 6. Private equity never left the market 
– although it did slow in Q1 2016
 7. Texas and Oklahoma are more 
diverse than investors believed, 
and it was not “another 1980s” in 
oil patch states
 8. Services held up reasonably well
 9. The regulators were reasonable 
and took prudent actions through 
the downturn
 10. OPEC and its machinations were 
largely irrelevant
 11. U.S. exploration and production 
companies became recognized as 
the swing producers, and they 
behaved rationally
 12. Production and demand balanced 
– but it took time

 Earnings Momentum:
 • Noteworthy items impacting Q1 profitability:
 • Improved interest rate environment. BOKF balance sheet behaving more asset sensitive in the 
early part of the current interest rate cycle.
 • Continued healthy fee and commission income, driven by wealth management.
 • Much better expense management: total expenses down $21 million despite full quarter of Mobank-
 related operating expenses.
 • Significant improvement in MSR hedging outcomes.
 • Benign credit environment – no provision for loan losses in the quarter.

 2017 Expectations
  Mid-single-digit loan growth for the full year
  $700 million reduction in available for sale securities portfolio for the full year
  Stable to increasing net interest margin 
 Low-single-digit net interest revenue growth (linked quarter annualized)
  Loan loss provision of $15 - $20 million for the year
  Low-single-digit revenue growth from fee-generating businesses on a trailing twelve month basis
  Expenses flat to slightly down compared to 2016 (GAAP basis)
  Capital deployment through organic growth, acquisitions, dividends, and limited stock buybacks

 Sustainability of Earnings Momentum
 Metric Guidance Rationale
 Net Interest Margin Barring dramatic change in competitive environment or deposit betas, NIM is 
expected to trend up for balance of the year
 Net Interest
 Income
 Loan growth offset by reduction in AFS securities portfolio, combined with higher 
NIM, should result in consistent low-single-digit sequential increases for balance of 
2017
 Fee Income Strength in wealth management is offsetting softness in other fee revenue lines. 
Expect Transfund to rebound from soft first quarter, and mortgage to be pressured all 
year. Overall, we expect continued mid single digit growth on trailing twelve month 
basis.
 Expense 
Management
 Personnel Expense should remain relatively flat compared to Q1 for balance of the 
year. 
FDIC expenses lower due to risk factors. This impacted the P&L earlier than we 
expected. Should be sustainable. 
Professional fees and services lower due to completion of Mobank transaction and 
insourcing of certain mortgage functions. Should be sustainable.
 MSR prepayment (amortization) expense will fluctuate with the refi market but should 
run consistently lower than 2016 ($40.7 million).
 Loan Loss 
Provision
 Guided lower after Q1 earnings. New guidance range $15-$20 million.

 Interest Rate Risk Management
  Managing the balance sheet to be neutral for interest rate movements is a 
core, fundamental tenet of BOKF’s long-term philosophy
  If BOKF had moved 4% asset sensitive (peer average) on January 1, 2013 
(assumed as the starting date for the current banking industry asset 
sensitivity craze) it would have forsaken more than $300 million in net 
interest income over the ensuing four years

	88
 Interest Rate Risk Management
 Non-maturity Deposit Assumptions
 • Now, more than ever, non-maturity deposit assumptions play a critical role in the 
measurement of interest rate risk.
 • Relatively small differences in repricing and balance assumptions can drive large 
differences among the interest rate risk positions reported by banks.
 What This Means for BOKF
 • Our modestly liability-sensitive position in an UP 200bp scenario assumes
 - Historical interest-bearing NMD product betas with no additional lag over the next few 
rate hikes
 - Material migration of non-interest DDA into interest-bearing alternatives
 • To the extent there’s additional pricing lag over the next few rate hikes (relative to 
pre-crisis product betas), BOKF will outperform expectations

 • No material pressure on deposit pricing at this time
 • Liquidity/deposit initiatives have been developed, inventoried, and 
prioritized
 • Focus is on optimizing the balance between growth and cost as 
competition for deposits increases

 M&A Criteria and Return Objectives
  Whole bank acquisitions
  Primarily in-market (TX, KS/MO, CO)
  Bank and non-bank entities
  Ability to leverage existing business or add elements
  Revenue-generating capabilities
  Solid customer base
  Talented employee continuance
  Expense synergies are important, but secondary to revenue generation
  Cash-on-cash return (IRR) is primary metric
  Interested in EPS impact and other metrics (TBV multiple, TBV earn back), but 
secondary to return metrics
  Active executive calling/relationship building effort underway
 No material changes in M&A strategy and approach 
since prior investor day

 Conclusion: BOKF is a Best-in-
 Class Midsized Regional Bank
  A consistent strategy that works
  Plentiful organic growth opportunities
  Disciplined
  Entrepreneurial
  A mix of fee businesses unlike any other in the regional banking sector…all of which would 
trade at a premium on a stand alone basis
  A long-term focus that consistently outperforms peers across the economic cycle
  BUT…BOKF trades at a discount to regional peers:
