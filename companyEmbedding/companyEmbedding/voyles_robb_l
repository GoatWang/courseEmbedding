How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Securities fraud is a white-collar crime that has increased as the Internet and stock markets have grown. One securities fraud example was the infamous Enron scandal, which allegedly involved top executives manipulating financial reports and filing false tax reports. While it is difficult for many investment fraud victims to recover their money, using a securities fraud lawyer will better your chances.Securities and investment fraud lawyers in cities near Dallas, TXArlingtonBedfordCarrolltonDallasFlower MoundGrand PrairieHurstIrvingKellerMckinneyPlanoRichardsonSee all cities in Texas Nearby attorneys in related practice areasFinancial Markets and Services Attorneys 75201Consumer Protection Attorneys 75201Tax Fraud / Tax Evasion Attorneys 75201Federal Crime Lawyers 75201See all practice areas Dallas, TX attorneys by top languagesSpanishFrenchMandarinSet LocationCity and stateCancelSave

Our Leadership











Robb L. Voyles has served on our board of directors since July 2014. Mr. Voyles currently serves as Executive Vice President and General Counsel for Halliburton. Prior to joining Halliburton in September 2013, Mr. Voyles was a senior partner at Baker Botts L.L.P. where he had practiced law since 1987 and where he served as the Chair of the Litigation Department and a member of its executive committee. He holds a Juris Doctor degree, magna cum laude, from the University of Michigan Law School and a B.B.A. in accounting, summa cum laude, from the University of Dayton. We believe that Mr. Voyles' experience within the legal profession and his current role as an executive in the energy industry provide him with the necessary skills to be a valuable member of the Board of Jones Energy.
