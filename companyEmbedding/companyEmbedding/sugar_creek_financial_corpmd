The following table shows how we intend to use the net proceeds of the offering.
The actual net proceeds will depend on the number of shares of common stock sold
in the offering and the expenses incurred in connection with the offering.
Payments for shares made through withdrawals from deposit accounts at Tempo Bank
will reduce Tempo Bank’s deposits and will not result in the receipt of new
funds for investment.

Proceeds remaining for New Sugar Creek         $       876              38.7%     $     1,113             39.4%     $     1,349             39.8%     $    1,620             40.2% 

We initially intend to invest the proceeds retained from the offering at New
Sugar Creek in short-term investments, such as U.S. treasury and government
agency securities and cash and cash equivalents. The actual amounts to be
invested in different instruments will depend on the interest rate environment
and New Sugar Creek’s liquidity requirements. In the future, New Sugar Creek may
liquidate its investments and use those funds:

. to repurchase shares of its common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions;

. to pay dividends to shareholders, subject to regulatory restrictions;

. to finance the possible acquisition of other financial institutions or    
  other businesses that are related to banking, although we currently have no 
  plans, arrangements or understandings regarding potential acquisition  
  opportunities; and

. for general corporate purposes, including contributing additional capital to
  Tempo Bank.

Under current Federal Reserve Board regulations, we may not repurchase shares of
our common stock during the first year following completion of the conversion
and offering, except to fund equity benefit plans other than stock options or,
with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary circumstances exist.

Tempo Bank initially intends to invest the proceeds it receives from the
offering, which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Tempo
Bank, in short-term investments. Over time, Tempo Bank may use the proceeds that
it receives from the offering:

. to fund new loans;

. to finance the possible expansion of its business; and

. for general corporate purposes.

We currently do not have any specific plans for any expansion or diversification
activities that would require funds from this offering. Consequently, we
currently anticipate that the proceeds of the offering contributed to Tempo Bank
will be used to fund new loans. We expect that much of the loan growth will
occur in our one- to four-family residential mortgage portfolio, but we have not
allocated specific dollar amounts to any particular area of our portfolio. The
amount of time that it will take to deploy the proceeds of the offering into
loans will depend primarily on the level of loan demand.

Except as described above, we have no specific plans for the investment of the
proceeds of the offering and have not allocated a specific portion of the
proceeds to any particular use.


We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination
of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from
the many financial institutions operating in our market area and, to a lesser
extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, credit
unions and insurance companies. Several large holding companies operate banks in
our market area, including Bank of America, U.S. Bancorp and PNC Financial
Services Group. These institutions are significantly larger than us and,
therefore, have significantly greater resources. We also face competition for
investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and
government securities. At June 30, 2013, which is the most recent date for which
data is available from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, we held 8.0%
of the deposits in Clinton County, Illinois, which was the fifth largest market
share out of 11 institutions having office locations within Clinton County.

Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our
market area and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers,
such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also
comes from the increasing number of non-depository financial service companies
entering the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies
and specialty finance companies.

We expect competition to remain intense in the future as a result of
legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of
consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for
example, have lowered barriers to entry, allowed banks to expand their
geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible 
for non-depository institutions to offer products and services that 
traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit
affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which
promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry.
Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our growth in
the future.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations at September 30, 2016 and for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is intended to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) and the notes thereto, appearing in Part I, Item 1 of this report and the Consolidated Financial Statements (Audited) and the notes thereto, appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  This Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of words such as "estimate," "project," "believe," "intend," "anticipate," "plan," "seek," "expect," "will," "may" and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:  � statements of our goals, intentions and expectations;  � statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;  � statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and  � estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits.  These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q, except as may be required under applicable law.  The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements:  � general economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;  � competition among depository and other financial institutions;  � changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;  � adverse changes in the securities markets;  � changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital requirements;  � our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;  � changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  � changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board;  � changes in our organization, compensation and benefit plans;  � changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital; and  � changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own.  Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements.  Overview-General  Our principal business is to acquire deposits from individuals and businesses in the communities surrounding our offices and to use these deposits to fund loans. We focus on providing our products and services to two segments of customers:  Income. Our primary source of income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income.  A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which is revenue that we receive from providing products and services. The majority of our noninterest income generally comes from loan service charges and service charges on deposit accounts.  Expenses. The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of compensation and benefits expenses, occupancy expenses, equipment and data processing expenses, FDIC premiums, costs from operation of foreclosed real estate, professional and regulatory fees and other miscellaneous expenses, legal and accounting fees and expenses of stockholder communications and meetings.  Our largest noninterest expense is compensation and benefits, which consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits, including employee stock ownership plan allocations.  Critical Accounting Policy  In the preparation of our financial statements, we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  Certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by us that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities. We consider these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies. The judgments and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors, which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates under different conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying values of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations.  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  Allowance for Loan Losses. We consider the allowance for loan losses to be our critical accounting policy. The allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged to operations. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are:  Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016  Cash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $3.3 million to $11.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $14.6 million at March 31, 2016 primarily as a result of increased loan originations since March 31, 2016.  Loans. The largest segment of our loan portfolio is single-family owner occupied residential real estate loans. At September 30, 2016, single-family, owner occupied residential real estate loans totaled $65.9 million, or 81.1% of total loans, compared to $63.6 million, or 80.1% of total loans at March 31, 2016. The increase in single-family owner occupied residential real estate loans is the result of new originations exceeding repayments.  Single-family non-owner occupied residential real estate loans, the second largest segment of our loan portfolio, totaled $9.2 million, or 11.3% of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $9.0 million, or 11.4% of total loans, at March 31, 2016. Single-family non-owner occupied residential real estate loan balances increased due to new originations exceeding repayments.  Multi-family and commercial real estate loans totaled $3.5 million, or 4.3% of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.6 million, or 4.5% of total loans, at March 31, 2016. Reductions in these loan segments were a result of repayments by borrowers largely as a result of the competitive environment for financing these types of mortgage loans.  Consumer loan balances totaled $1.8 million, or 2.2% of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $2.0 million, or 2.5% of total loans, at March 31, 2016. The reduction in consumer loans was a primary result of repayments by borrowers and to a lesser extent by competitive dealer financing offers.  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  Land loan balances totaled $909,000, or 1.1% of total loans, at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.2 million, or 1.5% of total loans, at March 31, 2016. The reduction in this segment of the portfolio is a result of payments and prepayments net of new originations since March 31, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, fixed-rate loans, balloon loans and adjustable-rate loans totaled $42.4 million, $38.9 million and $10,600, respectively. A balloon mortgage is a mortgage that does not fully amortize over the term of the loan, and therefore, a large portion of the principal balance is repaid with a single payment at the end of its term.  Loan originations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1.6 million to $5.2 million, from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to a better residential real estate sales market.  Investments.At September 30, 2016, our investment portfolio totaled $1.2 million and consisted solely of our investment in the FHLBC stock. Our investment in FHLBC stock was unchanged from March 31, 2016. At September 30, 2016, excess or voluntary FHLB stock increased to $879,214 from $569,614 at March 31, 2016. The increase of $309,600 in excess or voluntary FHLB stock was due to reductions in membership and borrowing activity requirements.  Other Assets.Other assets totaled $224,000 at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $98,000 from March 31, 2016. The decrease over the period was due primarily to a lower prepaid multi-employer plan benefit expense and the timing of other prepaid items.  Deposits. Deposits totaled $77.5 million at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.4 million from March 31, 2016. This decrease in balances occurred in certificates of deposit and attributed to local competitive rates being offered for certificates of deposit. Our deposit base is comprised of noninterest-bearing NOW accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We consider our deposit accounts other than certificates of deposit to be core deposits. At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016, the Bank had no brokered deposits.  Borrowings. We utilize FHLBC advances to supplement our supply of funds for loans. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 there were no new advances or repayments made.  Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  General. Net earnings of $30,000 were recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with a net loss of $4,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net earnings was primarily due to an increase in interest income and a reduction in noninterest expense.  Total Interest Income. Total interest income increased $31,000 to $850,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was due primarily to higher interest income on loans receivable as a result of higher average loan balances.  Total Interest Expense. Total interest expense decreased $4,000 to $222,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $226,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease resulted primarily from lower money market rates and balances.  At September 30, 2016, the Bank had a $5.0 million fixed rate FHLB advance that carries an effective interest rate of 4.78% and matures February 13, 2017. The advance was obtained in a substantially higher interest rate environment. The Bank has not prepaid the advance because it would involve a substantial penalty.  Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $35,000 to $628,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $593,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due primarily to higher interest income on loans receivable.  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  Provision for Loan Losses. We establish provisions for loan losses which are charged to operations at a level we believe to be appropriate to our credit risk profile. These provisions represent management's best estimate of probable loan losses in the portfolio. In evaluating the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the composition of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that might impact a borrower's ability to repay the loan, the value of the underlying collateral, and other information, including the level of nonaccrual loans. During the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not record a loss provision. The effects of the economic downturn and unemployment appear to have begun to moderate in our market area, and while delinquencies are still an issue to be monitored, employment in the local area is improving and recent increases in home sale prices are improving collateral values.  Average Balances and Yields. The following table presents information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting average yields and costs, and are annualized. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. For purposes of this table, average balances are calculated using daily balances for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and nonaccrual loans are included in average balances only. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans and are insignificant. None of the income reflected in the following table is tax-exempt income.   SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP.

Total noninterest income was $33,000 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to $30,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Noninterest Expense.Noninterest expense consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, equipment and data processing, occupancy, FDIC premium expense and other noninterest expenses. Total noninterest expense was $621,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $634,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease of $13,000 in noninterest expense is attributed to lower other noninterest expense. Other noninterest expense decreased due primarily to lower supplies expense and public company related costs.  Income Taxes.Income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,000 compared to a tax benefit of $7,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax earnings.  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended September 30, 2015 and 2014  General. Net earnings for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $64,000 and $41,000, respectively. The increase in net earnings was primarily due to an increase in interest income on loans receivable.  Total Interest Income.Total interest income increased $58,000 to $1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to $1.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to the effects of higher loan originations, increased dividends on FHLB stock and higher returns on other interest-earning assets. While the average yield (annualized) of the loan portfolio decreased to 4.17% for the six months ended September 30, 2015 from 4.33% for the same period in 2015, the average yield (annualized) on total interest-earning assets was 3.59% and unchanged for the same period in 2015.  Total Interest Expense.Total interest expense increased $16,000 to $446,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from $430,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was a result of the local competitive market forces for acquiring certificates of deposits.  The Bank has a $5 million fixed rate advance that carries an interest rate of 4.78% and matures February 13, 2017. The advance was obtained in a substantially higher interest rate environment. The Bank has not prepaid the advance because it would involve a substantial penalty.  Net Interest Income.Net interest income increased $42,000 to $1.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is due primarily to higher interest income on loans receivable.   SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY The following table summarizes average balances and average yields and costs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Yields are annualized.

For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank did not record a provision for loan losses. During the six months ended September 30, 2015, the Bank recorded a net credit to the provision for loan losses of $11,700. The effects of the economic downturn and unemployment appear to have begun to moderate in our market area. While delinquencies are still an issue, employment in the local area has improved and recent increases in home sale prices are improving collateral values.  Noninterest Income. Noninterest income includes service charges on deposit accounts, loan service charges, and other income. Total noninterest income increased $4,000 for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 to $68,000 from $64,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to higher service charges on deposit accounts.  SUGAR CREEK FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY  Noninterest Expense.Noninterest expense primarily consists of compensation and employee benefits, equipment and data processing, occupancy, FDIC premium expense and other expenses. Total noninterest expense decreased $3,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016.  Compensation and benefit expense increased $19,000 to $667,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from $648,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was due to increased compensation and health care costs partially offset by a decrease in multi-employer plan benefit expense.  Advertising expense decreased $6,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from $18,000 for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is related primarily to a change in the Bank's advertising focus from traditional forms such as yellow pages and newspapers to more electronic and social media venues.  Other noninterest expense decreased $18,000 to $138,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from $156,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to lower public company related costs and supplies expense.  Income Taxes.Income tax expense for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was $38,000 compared to $22,000 for the six months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in tax expense is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income.  Analysis of Nonperforming and Classified Assets.  We consider foreclosed real estate, repossessed assets, nonaccrual loans and accruing troubled debt restructurings to be nonperforming assets. Loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become 90 days delinquent at . . .  Nov 09, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
