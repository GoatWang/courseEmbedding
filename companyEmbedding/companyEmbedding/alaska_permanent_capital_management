INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND DIRECT INVESTMENTS
APFC directly manages about a third of the Permanent Fund's investments, and hires specialized investment managers to invest the remainder.  Each direct investment or portfolio is part of an overall design to balance the Fund's total investment risk and return.  To evaluate investment performance, APFC assigns each portfolio or investment a benchmark index.  With regard to stocks, active managers attempt to outperform their benchmarks, while passive managers attempt to replicate the indexes that comprise their benchmarks, and match benchmark performance.

Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics

Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team.
