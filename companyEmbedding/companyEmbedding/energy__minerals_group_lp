The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Zamansky LLC Investigates Energy & Minerals Group Fund II, III and IV, LP (EMG Funds)
March 21, 2016



Zamansky LLC is investigating the Energy & Minerals Group Fund II, III and IV, LP hedge funds (the “EMG Funds”), offered by Energy & Minerals Group (“EMG Group”), the firm led by John T. Raymond, the son of former the former Exxon Mobil Corp. Chief Executive Officer Lee Raymond.
The investigation concerns the reported $2 billion invested by the EMG Funds in a venture run by deceased Aubrey McClendon, the former CEO of Chesapeake Energy, who was indicted shortly before his death.   EMG was the largest backer of McClendon’s American Energy Partners fund which was buying up drilling rights in Texas and other parts of the country, with enormous debt.   With the collapse in oil prices, the EMG Funds have taken a severe hit.
If you were an investor in the EMG Funds and suffered a loss, please contact our firm for an evaluation of your rights.  You can contact Jake Zamansky by telephone at (212) 742-1414 or by email at jake@zamansky.com.
