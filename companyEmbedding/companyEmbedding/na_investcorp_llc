About us




We are a world-leading manager of alternative investments for select individuals and institutions. Founded in 1982, we’ve built a global reputation for superior performance, innovation and client service.
Investcorp has earned distinction through reliability, transparency, business judgment, value creation, innovation and superior results.
We combine the growth dynamics of Gulf capital and the alternative investment industry with international management discipline.
We were founded as, and remain, a firm that is global in its outlook, attitude and culture. As such, we have offices in New York, London, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Doha, Riyadh and Singapore.
As one of the largest and most diverse alternative investment managers – in terms of both product and geography – we are uniquely placed to offer our clients a range of attractive investment products.
We currently have more than $21.4 billion of assets under management.
We have a unique placement capability in the Gulf, where we offer a high level of personal service to an investor base of high-net-worth individuals and institutions.
We are different because we offer investments to our clients on a deal-by-deal basis, reflecting our investors' preference for investment discretion.
What's more, we co-invest significantly with our clients across our business areas, which ensures that our interests are firmly aligned with theirs. Many of our clients have also chosen to be shareholders of Investcorp; they feel pride and involvement in, and ownership of, our success.
At Investcorp, we pride ourselves on the long-term relationships we have built with our clients, based on mutual trust, respect and delivery. Our dedicated client service team acts as a trusted and informed advisor to clients.
