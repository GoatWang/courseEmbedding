Buyer's Guide







 by Brian Westfall,
Market Research Associate
Last Updated: July 27, 2017 







Employee reviews are arguably the best opportunity an organization has to energize and motivate its employees. Managers get a chance to sit down and have a one-on-one conversation with employees, as well as give and receive 360-degree feedback. For many organizations, though, the process of scheduling, executing and documenting reviews can be incredibly arduous. Relying on traditional methods, managers and human resources (HR) professionals are left with countless paper forms and records to review and file, which takes away from time and energy spent on the review itself. 
There are more than 100 different employee performance management software solutions available for modernizing and automating the evaluation processes in an organization. With so many options to review, it’s no small task to find the best fit for your organization. That’s why we have written this buyer’s guide to help you identify the right solution.
Here’s what we’ll cover:
What Is Employee Evaluation Software? What Type of Buyer Are You? Benefits and Potential IssuesMarket Trends to Understand The Vendor Landscape

What Is Employee Evaluation Software?
Employee evaluation software systems automate the cumbersome—and often time consuming—task of regularly evaluating employees. With the right evaluation and employee management software in place, the challenge of strategically developing your organization's workforce becomes a collaborative effort with tangible results. These systems enable employers to focus on identifying top talent and developing employees to better fit the needs of an organization. Employee appraisal software also makes it easier for managers to track employees’ goals and performance throughout the year, and then share this information with authorized users across the organization.
The HR software market is growing, and the emergence of new strategic companies has pushed all vendors to increase the pace of innovation. One major change in HR and talent management software has been the move toward cloud computing. Cloud computing, also known as Software as a Service (SaaS), is a model in which the software vendor hosts the application on the web, making it easy for you to securely access the application through any Web browser.

One key benefit of Web-based software is that users can access the system from anywhere. With this model, employees can log in and perform self reviews, view past reviews, view recent achievements against goals set and schedule reviews without bothering the busy folks in HR. Managers can set reminders, run performance reports, flag top talent for advancement and then easily share this information among departments. Traditionally, these activities were more limited to the HR department, where a much smaller set of employees had access to older client/server systems.
Employee review software functionality includes:


Performance notes


Goal tracking


Information sharing


Stack ranking


Electronic record-keeping


Interdepartmental communication


Real-time reporting


Performance rating



What Type of Buyer Are You?
Before reviewing employee performance evaluation software, it's important to assess what type of buyer you are. We believe that 90 percent of buyers fit into one of these categories:
Best-of-breed buyers. These buyers work for organizations looking for ways to specifically enhance their review processes. The organization may already have an HR system in place, but needs a better solution with measurable results to monitor, track and review employees. These buyers want straightforward, simple-to-use tools that can be implemented into their complex HR operation with minimal interruption. High functionality is key, and best-of-breed performance appraisals systems are the best place to start.
Integrated suite buyers. These buyers work for organizations where some of the HR processes have become disjointed and inconsistent. Their current processes for performance reviews may be outdated, and they struggle to easily identify and cultivate key performers. These buyers are interested in improving existing human resources systems across the board to create a more efficient, effective process for both managers and employees. Integrated HR suites with a robust portfolio of applications, including well-developed employee evaluation systems, offer the best solution for these buyers.
Cost-conscious buyers. These buyers work for organizations looking to roll out a modernized performance appraisal process that engages and motivates their talent to its fullest potential while keeping costs low. Although there are inexpensive on-premise options available, the SaaS model—which runs on a monthly service fee is changing the industry. That means organizations with more limited resources can now take advantage of feature-rich performance appraisal solutions for less.

Benefits and Potential Issues
Thanks to recent developments in the employee evaluation software market, updating processes to engage, energize and retain talent is less daunting. It’s just a matter of performing thorough performance management software comparisons and finding the right system that can handle your unique needs today and in the years to come. By implementing a new system and modernizing your approach to reviews and workforce development, your organization has a great opportunity to build culture, while attracting and retaining top talent.
Many managers lack the time required to effectively execute annual reviews. Reviewing paper records, submitting forms and manually tracking performance throughout the year can be a hassle. Consequently, organizations often miss out on the full value of the information generated in the review process. Not to mention, development and retention strategies are difficult to enforce, and top talent can slip through the cracks. By failing to take advantage of the performance appraisal software available to them, organizations run the risk of hurting their bottom line.

Market Trends to Understand
When researching employee performance review software, there are a number of market trends you should understand:
Software-as-a-Service. Cloud computing has changed the way we do HR. SaaS provides a user-friendly, Internet-based option for adding new functionality and accessibility for your employees. By giving them access to employee evaluation solutions anywhere they have Internet access, SaaS connects all parties involved, making the review process much more collaborative. With SaaS, HR solutions are also easier to implement than ever, which means faster adoption and improved user accessibility. Although the best-of-breed SaaS options offer best practices and allow for configuration to meet your needs, it's important to note that specific customization options can be limited.
Consolidation. Larger software companies have aggressively acquired many best-of-breed solutions to strengthen the arsenal of their integrated suites. For buyers, this means increased functionality and integration with the rest of your HR system. This is especially important in the employee review process, as it broadens the scope of reviews to encompass an employee’s entire lifecycle within an organization. Employee information that previously existed in silos is now centralized and highly visible for managers, enabling organizations to identify top performers and focus their retention efforts strategically. Be sure to lock in rates and service terms, though, as disruption in service can occur when vendors are acquired.
Strategic HR. Basic HR such as payroll, benefits management and human resource management systems (HRMS) now serve as the backbone for a much larger, more complex organism. This complex organism, or “strategic HR,” encompasses the functions and processes associated with talent management and workforce management. HR software developers have turned out a number of products aimed at making concepts like talent pooling, proactive management and strategic development more tangible and attainable for organizations. The emergence of SaaS has had a strong impact on the emerging relevance of strategic HR, and organizations would be wise to tap into performance appraisal systems that put the right tools in their hands.

The Good The Alta HR has a slim and stylish design with 7-day battery life, and all-day fitness and heart rate tracking.
The Bad It isn't water-resistant, and notifications can be difficult to read. You can't manually start workouts. Automatic exercise tracking and no buttons means no on-band controls.
The Bottom Line Long battery life and stylish design combined with improving app software make the Alta HR the best all-around fitness tracker for most people.

Fitbit Alta HR



Guess what: Fitbit's newest tracker is its best one yet. There are a lot of Fitbits to choose from, but after wearing all of them, the Fitbit Alta HR ($129.95 at Dell Home) wins our vote. It has almost all of the same features as the Charge 2 ($149.95 at Dell Home), our old favorite tracker, but in a design that is 25 percent slimmer with better battery life. The Alta HR has continuous heart-rate, basic phone notifications, and after wearing it for weeks it's proven to be a great fitness ($119.00 at Amazon.com) companion.For me, it's all about design. I've been wearing the Alta HR for almost a month and plan to continue wearing it even after this review. It's comfortable to wear and doesn't sacrifice any features, but what sold me was the seven day battery life. Now if only it were swim-proof like the Flex 2 ($99.95 at Dell Home), then it would have been a grand slam. The Alta HR costs $150, £130 or AU$250, the same price as the Charge 2. For most people, the Charge 2's extra few features probably aren't worth it. If you do care about manually tracking workouts or having a stopwatch, get the Charge 2, otherwise the Alta HR is the fitness tracker we recommend. A slim heart rate trackerFitbit's heart rate tracking has finally found its way into a smaller band. The Alta HR is the same size as the original Alta ($129.95 at Dell Home), and has all of the same features, plus heart rate. It can track steps, distance, calories burned, active minutes and sleep. To look at these stats, just tap the Alta HR's case below the screen (the display isn't touch-sensitive, but the Alta HR can detect forceful taps). Unfortunately, it doesn't do stair climbing or have a "Relax" mode like the Charge 2. The Alta HR (top) compared to the original Alta (bottom).

                                                The tracker's narrow monochrome LED will also display notifications for incoming calls, text messages and calendar alerts, and will provide reminders to move throughout the day. As I said with the original Alta, though, these notifications can be difficult to read due to the small display. The heart rate sensor measures heart rate at 5-second intervals continuously throughout the day. This is the same as the Charge 2 and Blaze ($199.95 at Dell Home), but both of those can also manually start workouts which increase the sample rate to once every second. In everyday use over a few weeks, I didn't miss that faster heart rate sampling, but serious workout warriors might.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                
The Fitbit app provides a graph of all-day heart rate and resting heart rate. It also displays a personalized Cardio Fitness score. This is the same score that debuted last fall on the Charge 2 and is slated to arrive on the Blaze. It's an estimate of overall health that is based on your VO2 Max, a widely accepted metric that is used to determine how well our bodies can use oxygen during workouts. A stylish tracker with long battery lifeThe Alta HR supports a wide variety of swappable bands. There are rubber ones in multiple colors and even more stylish leather and metal options. The straps from the original Alta will work with the Alta HR (and vice versa). Swappable bands also mean less wear and tear on the actual Fitbit device.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                While the straps are backward compatible, the clip-on proprietary charging cable isn't. Luckily, you won't have to charge it often. The Alta HR will last an entire week on a single charge, which is damn impressive given the small size.

The Good Continuous heart rate tracking. Slim design. Affordable price. Works with Windows, iPhone and Android phones. Fitbit's massive popularity means you'll be able to join up and compete with friends. Connects with many third-party fitness apps. Automatic sleep and activity tracking. Five-day battery life.
The Bad Design and fit aren't ideal for glancing at heart rate. Not shower or swim-friendly. OLED display turns off after a few seconds, which gets annoying. Heart-rate coaching and goal-setting isn't intuitive.
The Bottom Line Fitbit's Charge HR combines heart rate tracking, sleep tracking and fitness into an affordable, slim band with good battery life. It's a hard combination to beat.

Fitbit Charge HR



Editors' note (August 29, 2016): Fitbit has announced the Charge 2, a new tracker with a larger OLED display and swappable bands. The new model will replace the Charge HR reviewed here.I was a little bit wrong about the Fitbit Charge HR.While I liked it when it first debuted, I thought it could do better. The Charge HR is Fitbit's step-counting band, plus a round-the-clock heart-rate tracker. It tracks sleep at night, exercise during the day, and active heart-rate levels when resting or working out, and it syncs with nearly every major smartphone and computer on the planet.I expected more out of the Fitbit Charge HR's heart rate measuring, and how it translated that data into useful coaching. I wanted more app features, too. And I thought the band itself, a basic black device that doubled as a watch with its little LED display, could have been better designed.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                Most of a year has passed, and the fitness-wearable landscape hasn't been able to beat what the Fitbit Charge HR does. No heart-rate band costs this little, feels this small, and connects to as good an app. Fitbit folds nutrition-tracking, sleep-tracking, heart rate-tracking, and social challenges with friends into one pretty clean phone experience -- and syncing is fast and easy. The Charge HR fits well and has impressive battery life for its size: over four days, beating most continuous heart rate-tracking bands. And its little LED display-slash-clock is basic, but it's easy to lift your arm and see the time, or tap the display to see steps and other data.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                New software and firmware updates have improved syncing and tracking, adding automatic sleep and activity-session tracking awareness and making tweaks to how it measures heart rate. It's smoother and better than when I first reviewed it. And it now feels like a truly automatic band.It's the all-in-one fitness band I'd buy, especially for its low price ($150 in the US; in the UK, £120; or AU$180 in Australia) -- and it can be had even lower if you catch it on sale, which we've seen frequently. It's not perfect, but few wearable gadgets are -- and none of the other watches and bands have been able to beat it at its own fitness game.Editors' note: This review was originally published on January 29, 2015, and updated significantly on November 24, 2015. The rating has been raised from 7.8 to 8.0.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                Design: Basic, but it worksThe Charge HR looks nearly identical to the older Fitbit Charge, and the discontinued  Fitbit Force  before it. It has an innocuous rubberized wraparound band, with a narrow black LED display that tells time, steps, and other data. That LED display isn't always lit, but you can set the Charge HR to show the time when you raise your wrist, or show time and fitness data by tapping the screen. It's a functional but unattractive everyday watch.The band attaches with a standard watch buckle-type clasp, making it more secure and less likely to pop off. It fits snugly, but sometimes feels uncomfortable on my wrist: an optical heart-rate monitor with green LEDs bulges out of the bottom, pressing against the skin a bit when the Charge HR's properly secured.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                Fitbit recommends wearing the Charge HR a finger's length above the wristbone on your arm for ideal heart-rate readings, which is farther up my own arm than I prefer to wear things. But I found it generally worked no matter where I wore it.The Charge HR comes in several muted colors; my review unit was black. It comes in several sizes, too, although each can be adjusted significantly. 
The Charge HR comes with its own proprietary USB dongle for charging, plugging straight into the bottom. Don't lose it.
                                                    Sarah Tew/CNET
                                                Heart rate: All day on your wristOnce attached, the Charge HR immediately flashes its green LEDs to gather heart-rate data. It does it all the time. That, plus a built-in accelerometer and barometer gather data on steps, heart rate, elevation (steps climbed) and intensity of exercise (walking or running). It works automatically, from the moment it goes on your wrist. The Fitbit Charge HR found my heart rate quickly and held onto the reading, so I could access it quickly by pressing the side button or tapping the display, cycling through to heart-rate mode. Like many other on-wrist heart rate readers, they're more accurate when resting. The reading fluctuated during active exercise. That's true of Apple Watch, the Microsoft Band and many others; it comes with the territory. The Charge HR feels as good as those.

Pros:  we love its flexibility and the many automated features from e-mails to task assignments
Cons:  well, this is a tough one, but we wish there was a "User Manual" or a video depository for using the system, because there is soooooo much the system can do, and it can be a struggle to remember it all, especially as a new user
Overall:  Agileats has SAVED us from a mountain of manual on-boarding processes and work; we absolutely LOVE this system.  We outgrew our former ATS, which we've had for over 6 years because it was incapable of making some minor enhancements that would help us (HR), work much more efficiently and after repeated requests for this upgrade falling on "deaf" ears, we decided to research other ATS systems and thankfully, we found AgileHR......we have not looked back since.
From the communications and conversations with our sales rep. Melanie Webster to their implementation team, they have been TRUELY service oriented; it is an absolute pleasure working with them on our implementation, maintenance and customization for our needs....I cannot recommend this company and this system more....we are very pleased with our decision to partner with Agile, and am convinced you will be as well!
Recommendations to other buyers: I highly recommend this software; this is a "game changer" for us!

Pros:  The software is very user friendly even if you are not a techy person.
Overall:  My experience with Agile has been overwhelmingly the best! Everything from the start of our journey with getting things setup to following up just to check in has been the best. I have never worked with staff that have made me feel so secure in knowing that they are just an email or phone call away. There are not enough stars to give them. I would recommend them if you want the best for your company.

Pros:  Flexibility, simplicity in design, responsiveness and customer service.
Cons:  Improvements take change, change always comes with wrinkles.  I will take the ability to change and improve with a few wrinkles (that are always attended to) as opposed to stagnate functionality cemented-in for main stream uses - as opposed to our specific needs.
Overall:  Agile HR provides an excellent solution for our needs.  Instead of overpaying for a bunch of fixed functionality we will never use, Agile has continually worked with us to develop the perfect solution for our unique industry and business model.  The only reason for 4 as opposed to 5 stars regarding use and features is that there is still functionality being developed.  Agile HR has aptly named their company, they are flexible, responsive and incessantly working to evolve and expand their platform.

Pros:  User friendly, easy to pick up how to use system
Cons:  A lot of time is wasted because the system does not remember any time you "sort" so you have to constantly re-sort after you click on something.  Very cumbersome and time-consuming!  Reports are unable to generate by entire year if you have a lot of data, so you have to run one month at a time and combine all the excel spreadsheets!   Those are just the few that come to mind.
Overall:  The Agile system has been easy to learn but is lacking some of the basic features of an ATS.  Customer support is great but slow to implement some of our requests.  The price is excellent so we are giving it another year to work out the kinks.

Pros:  I like that it looks good on our website, and provides a good candidate experience.
Cons:  The support of the software could improve and some of the features could be made more obvious.
Overall:  Overall, we are satisfied with the product.  It is pretty easy to use, and Agile offers a broad range of products.  I think that the customer service response time or availability could be improved, as well as a few of the features that are not intuitive or obvious.  Overall, I think it is a 4/5.

Pros:  The ease of use and the customer service.
Cons:  The email component is sometimes a little fickle, but still works well, especially compared to what we had been using before this.
Overall:  After reviewing about a dozen ATS products, we landed with Agile HR.  You simply won't find a better ATS for the price.  If you're frustrating with the customer service you've been receiving with your current ATS product, wish you had better reporting, or wanted a more updated look for your applicants, do yourself a favor and give Agile HR a call.
Recommendations to other buyers: Looking forward to utilizing the upgrades for our AAP this year.













We love our new PM System!

Comments:   Eric and his team at Agile have provided us with an excellent product for our ATS needs. Agile quickly gives us the information we need on requisitions and candidates, and has proven to be extremely intuitive and easy to use. Our team appreciates the exceptional technical support they provide, as well as the willingness to make adjustments for our specific needs.

Pros:  Agile has the best customer service I have seen in an ATS company.  Always available at with a phone call and email, and very responsive to company specific requests.
Cons:  None observed.  This is not an "out of the box" product.  A company needs to be prepared to articulate their needs, but this is in no way a con.
Overall:  If you are looking for an affordable and flexible solution, this is it!

Pros:  Agile is easy to learn and easy to use.  They are building new functions into the product everyday.  They listen to their customers and if you need a report, a templete or a tweak, they can have it to you with no hassle within days.  Agile doesn't charge for these updates like some of the other companies.  They are very responsive to the needs of their customers and have outstanding customer service!
Cons:  I haven't found any yet.
Overall:  I highly recommend Agile ATS.

540 additional Human Resources products were named Runners Up for March 2017








What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing HR Software Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 560 human resource information system (HRIS) products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their price/cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of 3.0 for both capability and value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. They appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners sub-quadrant might be best. For example, buyers wanting a core system with a strong focus on personnel tracking and workforce management capabilities might consider software in the Contenders sub-quadrant, while those looking for a more comprehensive platform with features like performance management and applicant tracking might look in the Leaders sub-quadrant.
You can download the full FrontRunners for HRIS Management report. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 20 reviews and meet minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, to be considered for FrontRunners, HRIS products must offer personnel tracking, benefits administration and reporting capabilities.
From there, user reviews and other product performance details, such as the product's customer base and the features it offers, dictate the Capability and Value scores. Capability is plotted on the x-axis, and Value is plotted on the y-axis.

FrontRunners scores and graphics are derived from individual end-user reviews based on their own experiences, vendor-supplied information and publicly available product information; they do not represent the views of Gartner or its affiliates.







Runners Up
Providers listed as Runners Up were considered for inclusion in the quadrant, but were
                                ultimately not included for one or more reasons: they did not have enough reviews; they did
                                not meet the reviews score minimum; they did not meet the ultimate Value and Capability minimum
                                scores; or they did not meet our functionality requirements for the market.

What Is Human Resources Software?Overview of HR ApplicationsCommon Features of HR SoftwareWhat Type of Buyer Are You?Market Trends to UnderstandRecent Events You Should Know About

What Is Human Resources Software?
Human resources (HR) software solutions make managing a large or growing workforce more efficient. Vendors and buyers alike often refer to this category of software as human resources information systems (HRIS), human resources management systems (HRMS) or human capital management (HCM) software (though if you want to get specific, each of those categories has its own nuances).
What all HR solutions have in common is their ability to streamline the traditional HR functions of benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. But in addition to increasing your productivity by automating many of these administrative processes, HR software can also support you on a strategic level, by helping you to recruit, develop and manage your company’s most valuable resource: its people.

Overview of HR Applications 
Industry watchers break down the field of HR software into three main categories: Core HR, Workforce Management and Strategic HR—also called Talent Management or Talent Administration software.

Core HR encompasses the three traditional human resources management functions: benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. Every company will require these functions once it has reached a critical mass of employees. You need core HR functionality when, for instance, manually running payroll and managing employees with spreadsheets becomes too burdensome a task.
Workforce management, or Workforce administration as it is also called, comprises the range of software solutions intended to effectively schedule and track your workforce. These solutions are ideal for organizations whose employees work in shifts, and include applications to track time and attendance, monitor compliance with labor laws and usually include payroll functionality, or integrate well with other payroll software. It's important to note that there are industry-specific systems that offer attendance functionality outside of human resources software. Specifically, school administration software provides education organizations a means of tracking student attendance. This can include providing online portals for parents and teachers to monitor attendance online.
Strategic HR involves growing your company by attracting and developing the best people, as well as better managing your workforce overall. Strategic HR applications generally provide some combination of applicant tracking and recruiting, learning management as well as performance review functionality. This type of software streamlines these strategic processes to ensure that a company is using its staff as efficiently as possible, and also that employees are continuing to grow and develop—increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates.
Of course, core HR, workforce management and strategic HR functions often overlap. While there are best-of-breed solutions for individual functions in each category, there are also integrated suites boasting across-the-board functionality.

Common Features of HR Software
Core HR



Benefits administration
Manages employee benefits such as paid time off, medical/dental/life insurance policies and 401k participation. Example vendors: OmnipriseHRM, Epicor HR, Triton HR.


Personnel tracking
Centralizes employee data, such as SSN, contact information, past employment and demographic information. Example vendors: Sage HRMS, Ascentis, Lawson HR.


Payroll
Tracks employee salaries, bonuses, 401k contributions, health and other deductions; calculates withholding for taxes; and cuts paychecks. Most solutions provide integration for direct deposit as well. Example vendors: Halogen, Vista HRMS, Tribe HR.



Workforce Management



Time & attendance
Helps staff track employee attendance and absences, and enables employees to clock in and out. Many solutions also track PTO and sick days. Rules-based engines provide alerts when employees miss or perform established amounts of work. Example vendors: TimeForge Labor Management, LaborVIEW, Kronos.


Employee scheduling
Provides functionality for scheduling employee shifts and attendance to ensure compliance with staffing needs. Systems can schedule employees across departments, locations and projects, and provide alerts to employees when schedules change and when staffing levels are inadequate. Example vendors: Ascentis, Sage HRMS, UltiPro.



Strategic HR



Applicant tracking systems (ATS)
Provides a centralized database that lets recruiters store applicant information and employment applications throughout the application process. Features include candidate tracking, applicant status monitoring and direct integration with other HR applications. In addition, many vendors include on-boarding features, like the ability to perform background checks. Example vendors: iCIMS, MarketRate, NuViewHR.


Employee evaluation
Also known as performance review software, these applications offer a centralized system where supervisors can conduct and track reviews with employees. Features performance measuring, tracking and goal management. Example vendors: Empower by ECI, Cornerstone CSB, People-Trak.


Learning & development
Establishes a centralized hub to monitor new employee training and the ongoing skills development of existing employees. Features include content authoring and management, curriculum and certification path definition, testing and reporting. Example vendors: Prosperity LMS, Halogen Talent Management Suite, SmartTeam.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Given the wide variety of popular HR software available, the task of choosing one solution is daunting. To help you narrow the field, below we present four common buyer goals. One or more of these goals might align with your needs.
Streamline HR administrative tasks. If you’re a small to medium-sized company with no HR software, or you are using a few standalone solutions that you want to consolidate, you should consider an integrated HR suite. This will automate your more basic HR functions with a single system. Representative vendors: Sage HRMS, SAP - HR, Vista HRMS.  Boost efficiency when recruiting and hiring candidates. If you need to scale your workforce quickly, a best-of-breed recruiting and applicant tracking solution might be your best option. Many of these solutions can automatically post jobs to job boards and social media outlets, in addition to simplifying candidate tracking and on-boarding of new employees. With searchable databases of candidates and robust reporting capabilities, you can make the most of your current candidate pool, while expanding your talent base. Representative vendors: SuccessFactors, COMPAS, GoHire.  Manage a large pool of employees working in shifts. If you are faced with the task of staffing a workday with multiple shifts to assign and time-off requests to approve—such as the shift-work found at hospitals, grocery stores or restaurants—and need better tools to track your workforce, you need to build up the workforce administration pillar of your HRIS. Many solutions either feature a built-in payroll system to help when running massive payrolls, or integrate effectively with your current payroll software to ensure all hours worked by employees are compensated. Representative vendors: LaborView, TimeAttend, TimeForce.  Develop your workforce. You want to ensure that your best employees are recognized and rewarded so they stay with your company and continue to do great work. The broad category of talent management solutions help you do that, with everything from performance appraisal solutions, to systems for gathering peer feedback, to employee training tools. Benefits include increased retention rates, higher morale and greater employee productivity. Representative vendors: Halogen Talent Management Suite, Kenexa2x, NuView HR.

Market Trends to Understand
As you evaluate a human resources management system, it is helpful to understand a few current trends in this industry.
Consolidation of cloud-based HR software start-up vendors. Recently, there has been a trend in the HR software world toward consolidating as many applications as possible under one vendor. As such, companies have focused on developing integrated suites that allow HR departments to track an employee’s entire life cycle within an organization.
To that end, many best-of-breed providers have been acquired by larger vendors looking to extend the breadth of their integrated suite solutions. For instance, in 2012, SAP acquired SuccessFactors; Oracle bought Taleo (one of SuccessFactors’ competitors) and Salesforce.com completed its integration of Rypple, a social performance platform.
For buyers, this offers the opportunity to benefit from larger corporate resources, but it can also lead to disruptions as acquired companies are integrated and product offerings are rationalized. In anticipation, buyers should lock in rates and service/maintenance terms in their contract as this can save them a headache down the line.
Adoption of software as a service. HR software vendors have widely embraced the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or “Web-based,” deployment method. SaaS applications are easily implemented and updated, and can be accessed by HR staff and employees from almost any device with an Internet connection. Although most SaaS applications allow for some level of customization, it is important to realize that customization options to support your company’s unique needs can be somewhat limited.

Vendors such as TimeForce allow employees to request time-off through their Web-based system
Consumerization of HR software technology. A major shift in the development of enterprise software has been the emergence of consumer markets as a primary source of technology innovation—a trend called consumerization. From social media as a recruiting tool to mobile apps for managing HR on the go, consumer technologies are changing the way HR technology is being used. Vendors are beefing up collaborative capabilities in their systems and developing more intuitive user interfaces. When selecting the human resources system that’s best for you, third-party reviews of product features are a great way to distinguish which vendors will deliver.
 Vendors such as Bullhorn feature mobile accessibility

What Is the FrontRunners Quadrant?
A Graphic of the Top-Performing HR Software Products
FrontRunners quadrants highlight the top software products for North American small businesses. All products in the quadrant are top performers. Small businesses can use FrontRunners to make more informed decisions about what software is right for them.
To create this quadrant, we evaluated over 560 human resource information system (HRIS) products. Those with the top scores for their capability and value made the quadrant.
Scores are based largely on reviews from real software users, along with other product performance details (e.g., what features they offer, how many customers they have).
Is One Quadrant Better Than the Others?
Nope, Products in Any Quadrant May Fit Your Needs
Every product in this quadrant offers a balance of capability (how much the products can do) and value (whether they’re worth their price/cost) that makes them stand out in the race for small business software success.
FrontRunners has four sub-quadrants:

Upper Right = Leaders: Leaders are all-around strong products. They offer a wide range of functionality to a wide range of customers. These products are considered highly valuable by customers.
 
Upper Left = Masters: Masters may focus more heavily on certain key features or market segments than Leaders do. If you need a more specialized set of functionality without bells and whistles, then a product in the Masters quadrant might be right for you.
 
Lower Right = Pacesetters: Pacesetters may offer a strong set of features, but are not rated as highly on value. For example, a Pacesetter might offer greater functionality, but cost more.
 
Lower Left = Contenders: Contenders may focus on a more specialized set of capabilities that are priced at a higher point. This makes them ideal for companies willing to pay more for specific features that meet their unique needs.

Depending on the specific needs of a software buyer, a product in any of these sub-quadrants could be a good fit.
Why? To even be considered for this FrontRunners, a product had to meet a minimum user rating score of 3.0 for both capability and value. This means that all products that qualify as FrontRunners are top-performing products in their market. They appear in the quadrant in relation to how their peers performed.
For some buyers, a specific FrontRunners sub-quadrant might be best. For example, buyers wanting a core system with a strong focus on personnel tracking and workforce management capabilities might consider software in the Contenders sub-quadrant, while those looking for a more comprehensive platform with features like performance management and applicant tracking might look in the Leaders sub-quadrant.
You can download the full FrontRunners for HRIS Management report. It contains individual scorecards for each product on the Frontrunners quadrant.
How Are FrontRunners Products Selected?
Products Are Scored Based on User Reviews and Other Data
You can find the full FrontRunners methodology here, but the gist is that products are scored in two areas, Capability and Value.
To be considered at all, products must have at least 20 reviews and meet minimum user rating scores. They also have to offer a core set of functionality—for example, to be considered for FrontRunners, HRIS products must offer personnel tracking, benefits administration and reporting capabilities.
From there, user reviews and other product performance details, such as the product's customer base and the features it offers, dictate the Capability and Value scores. Capability is plotted on the x-axis, and Value is plotted on the y-axis.

One Last Thing—How Do I Reference FrontRunners?
Just Follow Our External Usage Guidelines
Check out the FrontRunners External Usage Guidelines when referencing FrontRunners content. Except in digital media with character limitations, the following disclaimer MUST appear with any/all FrontRunners reference(s) and graphic use:
FrontRunners scores and graphics are derived from individual end-user reviews based on their own experiences, vendor-supplied information and publicly available product information; they do not represent the views of Gartner or its affiliates.







Runners Up
Providers listed as Runners Up were considered for inclusion in the quadrant, but were
                                ultimately not included for one or more reasons: they did not have enough reviews; they did
                                not meet the reviews score minimum; they did not meet the ultimate Value and Capability minimum
                                scores; or they did not meet our functionality requirements for the market.

What Is Human Resources Software?
Human resources (HR) software solutions make managing a large or growing workforce more efficient. Vendors and buyers alike often refer to this category of software as human resources information systems (HRIS), human resources management systems (HRMS) or human capital management (HCM) software (though if you want to get specific, each of those categories has its own nuances).
What all HR solutions have in common is their ability to streamline the traditional HR functions of benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. But in addition to increasing your productivity by automating many of these administrative processes, HR software can also support you on a strategic level, by helping you to recruit, develop and manage your company’s most valuable resource: its people.

Overview of HR Applications 
Industry watchers break down the field of HR software into three main categories: Core HR, Workforce Management and Strategic HR—also called Talent Management or Talent Administration software.

Core HR encompasses the three traditional human resources management functions: benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. Every company will require these functions once it has reached a critical mass of employees. You need core HR functionality when, for instance, manually running payroll and managing employees with spreadsheets becomes too burdensome a task.
Workforce management, or Workforce administration as it is also called, comprises the range of software solutions intended to effectively schedule and track your workforce. These solutions are ideal for organizations whose employees work in shifts, and include applications to track time and attendance, monitor compliance with labor laws and usually include payroll functionality, or integrate well with other payroll software. It's important to note that there are industry-specific systems that offer attendance functionality outside of human resources software. Specifically, school administration software provides education organizations a means of tracking student attendance. This can include providing online portals for parents and teachers to monitor attendance online.
Strategic HR involves growing your company by attracting and developing the best people, as well as better managing your workforce overall. Strategic HR applications generally provide some combination of applicant tracking and recruiting, learning management as well as performance review functionality. This type of software streamlines these strategic processes to ensure that a company is using its staff as efficiently as possible, and also that employees are continuing to grow and develop—increasing employee satisfaction and retention rates.
Of course, core HR, workforce management and strategic HR functions often overlap. While there are best-of-breed solutions for individual functions in each category, there are also integrated suites boasting across-the-board functionality.

Common Features of HR Software
Core HR



Benefits administration
Manages employee benefits such as paid time off, medical/dental/life insurance policies and 401k participation. Example vendors: OmnipriseHRM, Epicor HR, Triton HR.


Personnel tracking
Centralizes employee data, such as SSN, contact information, past employment and demographic information. Example vendors: Sage HRMS, Ascentis, Lawson HR.


Payroll
Tracks employee salaries, bonuses, 401k contributions, health and other deductions; calculates withholding for taxes; and cuts paychecks. Most solutions provide integration for direct deposit as well. Example vendors: Halogen, Vista HRMS, Tribe HR.



Workforce Management



Time & attendance
Helps staff track employee attendance and absences, and enables employees to clock in and out. Many solutions also track PTO and sick days. Rules-based engines provide alerts when employees miss or perform established amounts of work. Example vendors: TimeForge Labor Management, LaborVIEW, Kronos.


Employee scheduling
Provides functionality for scheduling employee shifts and attendance to ensure compliance with staffing needs. Systems can schedule employees across departments, locations and projects, and provide alerts to employees when schedules change and when staffing levels are inadequate. Example vendors: Ascentis, Sage HRMS, UltiPro.



Strategic HR



Applicant tracking systems (ATS)
Provides a centralized database that lets recruiters store applicant information and employment applications throughout the application process. Features include candidate tracking, applicant status monitoring and direct integration with other HR applications. In addition, many vendors include on-boarding features, like the ability to perform background checks. Example vendors: iCIMS, MarketRate, NuViewHR.


Employee evaluation
Also known as performance review software, these applications offer a centralized system where supervisors can conduct and track reviews with employees. Features performance measuring, tracking and goal management. Example vendors: Empower by ECI, Cornerstone CSB, People-Trak.


Learning & development
Establishes a centralized hub to monitor new employee training and the ongoing skills development of existing employees. Features include content authoring and management, curriculum and certification path definition, testing and reporting. Example vendors: Prosperity LMS, Halogen Talent Management Suite, SmartTeam.




What Type of Buyer Are You?
Given the wide variety of popular HR software available, the task of choosing one solution is daunting. To help you narrow the field, below we present four common buyer goals. One or more of these goals might align with your needs.
Streamline HR administrative tasks. If you’re a small to medium-sized company with no HR software, or you are using a few standalone solutions that you want to consolidate, you should consider an integrated HR suite. This will automate your more basic HR functions with a single system. Representative vendors: Sage HRMS, SAP - HR, Vista HRMS.  Boost efficiency when recruiting and hiring candidates. If you need to scale your workforce quickly, a best-of-breed recruiting and applicant tracking solution might be your best option. Many of these solutions can automatically post jobs to job boards and social media outlets, in addition to simplifying candidate tracking and on-boarding of new employees. With searchable databases of candidates and robust reporting capabilities, you can make the most of your current candidate pool, while expanding your talent base. Representative vendors: SuccessFactors, COMPAS, GoHire.  Manage a large pool of employees working in shifts. If you are faced with the task of staffing a workday with multiple shifts to assign and time-off requests to approve—such as the shift-work found at hospitals, grocery stores or restaurants—and need better tools to track your workforce, you need to build up the workforce administration pillar of your HRIS. Many solutions either feature a built-in payroll system to help when running massive payrolls, or integrate effectively with your current payroll software to ensure all hours worked by employees are compensated. Representative vendors: LaborView, TimeAttend, TimeForce.  Develop your workforce. You want to ensure that your best employees are recognized and rewarded so they stay with your company and continue to do great work. The broad category of talent management solutions help you do that, with everything from performance appraisal solutions, to systems for gathering peer feedback, to employee training tools. Benefits include increased retention rates, higher morale and greater employee productivity. Representative vendors: Halogen Talent Management Suite, Kenexa2x, NuView HR.

Market Trends to Understand
As you evaluate a human resources management system, it is helpful to understand a few current trends in this industry.
Consolidation of cloud-based HR software start-up vendors. Recently, there has been a trend in the HR software world toward consolidating as many applications as possible under one vendor. As such, companies have focused on developing integrated suites that allow HR departments to track an employee’s entire life cycle within an organization.
To that end, many best-of-breed providers have been acquired by larger vendors looking to extend the breadth of their integrated suite solutions. For instance, in 2012, SAP acquired SuccessFactors; Oracle bought Taleo (one of SuccessFactors’ competitors) and Salesforce.com completed its integration of Rypple, a social performance platform.
For buyers, this offers the opportunity to benefit from larger corporate resources, but it can also lead to disruptions as acquired companies are integrated and product offerings are rationalized. In anticipation, buyers should lock in rates and service/maintenance terms in their contract as this can save them a headache down the line.
Adoption of software as a service. HR software vendors have widely embraced the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), or “Web-based,” deployment method. SaaS applications are easily implemented and updated, and can be accessed by HR staff and employees from almost any device with an Internet connection. Although most SaaS applications allow for some level of customization, it is important to realize that customization options to support your company’s unique needs can be somewhat limited.

Vendors such as TimeForce allow employees to request time-off through their Web-based system
Consumerization of HR software technology. A major shift in the development of enterprise software has been the emergence of consumer markets as a primary source of technology innovation—a trend called consumerization. From social media as a recruiting tool to mobile apps for managing HR on the go, consumer technologies are changing the way HR technology is being used. Vendors are beefing up collaborative capabilities in their systems and developing more intuitive user interfaces. When selecting the human resources system that’s best for you, third-party reviews of product features are a great way to distinguish which vendors will deliver.
 Vendors such as Bullhorn feature mobile accessibility

The idea was to move from using spreadsheets, physical documents, and Outlook calendars to manage recruiting and employee data. The idea will be that eventually managers will be able to view the hiring process and also external users will be able to apply for jobs.ProsReporting, out of the box and custom ones.Customization. For the most part the system can be modified to your liking.Support. The guys that you work with are great!Workflows for hiring/termination processes.Lots of modules.ConsAs much as I like the reporting, it could be a little more flexible. Can't add interview notes to reporting.Built on SharePoint, so any functionality limitations of SharePoint are going to be there.Support is great, but at times language barrier can be a little challenging.Had a bad experience with the US Sales team here. Wasn't responsive but finally got someone from another region to help us.Likelihood to Recommend8.0Lanteria HR is great for an HR department that's trying to get away from managing multiple spreadsheets or archaic systems. It allows you to store all your data in-house so it's not stored on some cloud server/service. Reporting and workflow setups are great and since it uses SharePoint, Active Directory integration works great as well.from Chris John's Full Review Johannes Kloch BadsbergImplementation Consultant | Information Technology and Services | 1-10 employeesLanteria HR Review: "IT & HR Partners"9 of 10  |  1/4/2016Invited By: VendorUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI am implementing the product for our clients.ProsEnd to end HRMS features that eases the workload at HR departments.Smoothly integrates with Microsoft Office and SharePoint intranets.Enables HR departments strenghts.Includes a Learning (LMS) platform.ConsDoesn't support SharePoint on Office365.Performance reviews should be more customizable.Likelihood to Recommend9.0The company should have an HR department with a manager who takes ownership of the system.from Johannes Kloch Badsberg's Full Review (2 More Sections)Lanteria HR Rating SummaryOverall Rating (2)8.0Likelihood to Recommend (2)8.0Feature Rating SummaryOnboarding (2)6.8New hire portal (1)8.2Manager tracking tools (2)5.2Compliance tracking and reporting (2)7.1Performance and Goals (2)8.0Corporate goal setting (2)8.0Subordinate goal setting (2)8.0Individual goal setting (2)8.0Line-of sight-visibility (2)8.0Performance tracking (2)8.0Performance Management (2)8.0Performance plans (2)8.0Plan weighting (2)8.0Performance improvement plans (2)8.0Review status tracking (2)8.0Rater nomination workflow (2)8.0Review reminders (2)7.8Workflow restrictions (2)7.8Multiple review frequency (2)8.1Reporting (2)8.0Succession Planning (2)8.1Create succession plans/pools (1)8.2Candidate ranking (2)8.0Candidate search (2)8.0Candidate development (1)8.2Recruiting / ATS (2)7.8Job Requisition Management (1)8.2Company Website Posting (2)7.9Publish to Social Media (1)6.4Job Search Site Posting (1)6.4Customized Application Form (2)8.0Resume Management (2)8.0Duplicate Candidate Prevention (1)8.2Candidate Search (2)8.0Applicant Tracking (2)8.0Collaboration (2)8.0Task Creation and Delegation (1)8.2Email Templates (1)8.2User Permissions (2)8.0Notifications and Alerts (2)7.9Reporting (2)8.0Lanteria HR DescriptionLanteria

What is HRMS?Core Human Resource (HR) Software, or Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS), encompasses benefits administration, personnel tracking and payroll. These systems are also referred to as back-end HR systems since they help manage key administrative HR tasks, and are essentially the employee system of record. These core tasks are distinct from strategic HR tasks like performance management, recruiting, talent management, and learning management. 
HR Software and the Emergence of HCM Suites
The dividing line between various HR software categories is blurring. Many core HR vendors are offering adjacent capabilities in order to capture the attention being given to categories that are seen as more strategic vs. administrative. Talent management software, for example, is focused on helping companies hire, train and keep the highest quality staff. A number of core HR vendors are adding talent management capabilities, just as some talent management vendors are adding in back-end core HR capabilities. Ultimate Software, Oracle, ADP, and SilkRoad all offer some combination of core HR and talent management features. Few Human Capital Management Suites provide equally strong capabilities across all areas, but convergence is an important trend.
Core HR Software Features & CapabilitiesThe Core HR features common to most products
in this category are as follows:
Human Resource Management

The primary function of Core HR
software is to provide a central database containing records for all employees
past and present, along with contractors. These records contain data on
employee personal information, employment history, job profiles, workflow for
transfers, promotions, pay raises, benefits information, etc.
Payroll Management

Payroll management capabilities
provide for calculation of employee pay and benefits, in addition to managing
direct deposit, salary revisions and payroll tracking.
Leave and Attendance Management

Leave and attendance management streamlines communication between HR and employees, and
facilitates efficient management of employee leave including requisitions,
approvals, balance calculation, and annual carry-forward
Employee Self-Service

Provision of an
employee portal allowing employees to view and update their personal
information. This removes considerable administrative burden from HR staff.
Asset Management

Some Core HR systems
have the ability to keep a record of assets such as laptops, pagers, cell
phones, etc. issued to employees. The record typically includes asset type,
number, serial number and date of issuance.
Reporting

HR
reporting has come to be seen as more important than ever as HR data is not
seen as strategic to the running of any business. Some vendors build their own
reporting capabilities, while others partner with BI vendors to embed 3rd-party
functionality.Core HR Listings Listings   All Types   ListingsSearchListings (1-25 of 112)Sort by: Reviews | Highest Rated | Lowest Rated | Alphabetical | Product | Service(591) 8.3UltiProUltimate Software delivers cloud-based HCM solutions that help businesses accelerate talent acquisition, simplify payroll computations, manage time and attendance, and support proactive, strategic talent management.Reviews (462)AlternativesUltiPro Product Tour(327) 7.0ADP Workforce NowADP Workforce Now is an cloud-based HR platform for mid-sized businesses.Reviews (160)AlternativesCompare ADP Workforce Now(160) 8.1TriNetTriNet is an HR solution designed for small and midsized businesses.

 (22 reviews)






Visit Website





            Appraisd is not your typical HR software.

We created Appraisd after listening to managers telling us how tedious and ineffective staff reviews can be. At the same time it's more vital than ever to help your employees grow and develop with feedback and goals.  Appraisd puts objectives, competencies, progress notes, personal development plans and feedback into the hands of staff themselves. That's how we get amazing ownership from employees and massively reduce the work required by HR.
            Learn more about Appraisd


            Appraisd will cut down on admin, track objectives & gather feedback in a beautiful appraisal system your staff will thank you for.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
