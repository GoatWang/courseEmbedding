As described in the Prospectus, the Notes will be issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust (the Issuer ), a trust formed by the Seller pursuant to a trust agreement between the Seller and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Delaware, as owner trustee. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an indenture (the Indenture ) between the Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as indenture trustee. In that connection, we are generally familiar with the proceedings taken or to be taken in connection with the proposed authorization, issuance and sale of the Offered Notes, and have examined and relied upon copies of such statutes, documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this opinion, including the Prospectus and current drafts of the Indenture (including the form of the Offered Notes included as an exhibit thereto) and an Amended and Restated Trust Agreement. Based on and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, with respect to the Offered Notes, when (a) the Indenture has been duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, (b) the Offered Notes have been duly executed and issued by the Issuer, Mayer Brown LLP operates in combination with other Mayer Brown entities with offices in Europe and Asia and is associated with Tauil & Chequer Advogados, a Brazilian law partnership.6 MAYER BROWN LLP Santander Drive Auto Receivables LLC Page 2 authenticated by the Indenture Trustee, and sold by the Seller, and (c) payment of the agreed consideration for the Offered Notes has been received by the Issuer, such Offered Notes will have been duly authorized by all necessary action of the Issuer and will be legally issued and binding obligations of the Issuer and entitled to the benefits afforded by the Indenture, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other laws relating to or affecting creditors rights generally (including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), and by general principles of equity, regardless of whether such matters are considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. Our opinions expressed herein are limited to the federal laws of the United States and the laws of the State of New York and the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit 5.1 to a Form 8-K filed in connection with the Prospectus and to the use of our name therein without admitting we are experts within the meaning of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

In that connection, we generally are familiar with the proceedings required to be taken in connection with the proposed authorization and issuance of the Offered Notes and have examined copies of such documents, corporate records and other instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purpose of this opinion, including the Prospectus, the Trust Agreement and the forms of the Indenture and other documents prepared in connection with the issuance of the Offered Notes (collectively, the Operative Documents ). The opinion set forth herein is based upon the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), Treasury regulations promulgated and Mayer Brown LLP operates in combination with other Mayer Brown entities with offices in Europe and Asia and is associated with Tauil & Chequer Advogados, a Brazilian law partnership.8 MAYER BROWN LLP Santander Drive Auto Receivables LLC Page 2 proposed thereunder, current positions of the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS ) contained in published Revenue Rulings and Revenue Procedures, current administrative positions of the IRS and existing judicial decisions.

Based on the foregoing and assuming that the Operative Documents are executed and delivered in substantially the form we have examined and that the transactions contemplated to occur under the Operative Documents in fact occur in accordance with the terms thereof, we are of the opinion that the statements, to the extent that they constitute matters of law or legal conclusions with respect thereto relating to United States federal tax matters, set forth in the Prospectus Supplement under the headings Summary of Terms Tax Status and Material Federal Income Tax Consequences and in the Base Prospectus under Material Federal Income Tax Consequences, which statements have been prepared by us, are correct in all material respects, and, to the extent such statements expressly state our opinions or state that our opinion has been or will be provided as to the Offered Notes, we hereby confirm and adopt the opinions set forth therein. We know that we are referred to under the captions referred to above included in the Prospectus, and we hereby consent to the use of our name therein and to use of this opinion for filing of this opinion as Exhibit 8.1 to a Form 8-K filed in connection therewith, without admitting that we are experts within the meaning of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued thereunder, with respect to any part of the Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

                            [Dow Jones & Company, Inc. · 2007-04-04] - The following is a press release  from Moody's Investors Service: Moody's Assigns Definitive Ratings To Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1 Asset Backed Notes $1.2 Billion of Asset-Backed Securities Rated.
                        

                            New York,  April 04, 2007 -- Moody's Investors Service has assigned ratings to the  notes issued by Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1.
                        

                            This  is the first subprime auto loan securitization for 2007 and the first  public transaction for Drive Financial Services Inc. (successor to Drive Financial Services LP).
                        

                            The complete rating action is as follows:
                        


                                Issuer: Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2007-1
                            

                                $204,000,000 5.324% Class A-1 Asset backed Notes, rated Prime-1
                            

                                $340,000,000 5.20% Class A-2 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $185,000,000 5.05% Class A-3 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            

                                $471,000,000 LIBOR + 0.05% Class A-4 Asset backed Notes, rated Aaa
                            


                            Moody's said the rating of Prime-1 for the Class A-1 notes is based primarily on the expected cashflows on the underlying receivables during the collection periods prior to the Class A-1 final maturity date, and partially on the financial guaranty insurance policy provided by Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC), whose insurance financial  strength rating is Aaa. The ratings of Aaa for the remaining classes of notes are based primarily on the FGIC policy. Moody's believes the risk  assumed by FGIC in insuring the notes is investment- grade at closing.

SANTANDER DRIVE AUTO RECEIVABLES LLC - S-3/A - 20070309 - RISK_FACTORS











	RISK FACTORS



	     An investment in the securities involves significant risks. Before you decide to invest, we
	recommend that you carefully consider the following risk factors.








	 


	 


	 








	You must rely for repayment only
	upon the issuing entitys assets
	which may not be sufficient to make
	full payments on your securities.




	 


	Your securities either represent
	interests solely in an issuing
	entity or indebtedness of an issuing
	entity. The issuing entity does not
	have and is not permitted to have
	any significant assets or sources of
	funds other than the contracts and
	the amounts on deposit in certain
	other accounts held by the indenture
	trustee on the securityholders
	behalf. Your notes will not
	represent an interest in or
	obligation of us, the originator or
	any other person. We or the
	originator may have a limited
	obligation to repurchase some
	contracts under some circumstances
	as described in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.
	Distributions on any class of
	securities will depend solely on the
	amount and timing of payments and
	other collections in respect of the
	related contracts and any credit
	enhancement for the securities
	specified in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. We cannot
	assure you that these amounts,
	together with other payments and
	collections in respect of the
	related contracts, will be
	sufficient to make full and timely
	distributions on your securities.
	The securities and the contracts
	will not be insured or guaranteed,
	in whole or in part, by the United
	States or any governmental entity
	or, unless specifically set forth in
	the applicable prospectus
	supplement, by any provider of
	credit enhancement.






	 



	 


	 






	The issuing entitys interest in the
	contracts could be defeated because
	the contracts will not be delivered
	to the issuing entity.




	 


	The servicer or its custodian will
	maintain possession of the original
	contracts in tangible form or
	control of the authoritative
	copies of the contracts in
	electronic form. If the servicer
	sells or pledges and delivers
	original contracts for the
	receivables to another party, in
	violation of its obligations under
	the agreements for the securities,
	this party could acquire an interest
	in the contract having a priority
	over the issuing entitys interest.
	Furthermore, if the servicer becomes
	the subject of a bankruptcy
	proceeding, competing claims to
	ownership or security interests in
	the receivables could arise. These
	claims, even if unsuccessful, could
	result in delays in payments on the
	securities. If successful, these
	claims could result in losses or
	delays in payment to you or an
	acceleration of the repayment of the
	securities.






	 



	 


	 






	The issuing entitys security
	interest in the financed vehicles
	will not be noted on the
	certificates of title, which may
	cause losses on your securities.




	 


	Upon the origination of a contract,
	the originator takes a security
	interest in the financed vehicle by
	placing a lien on the title to the
	financed vehicle. In connection
	with each contribution of contracts
	to the depositor, the originator
	will assign its security interests
	in the financed vehicles to the
	depositor, who will further assign
	them to the issuing entity.
	Finally, the issuing entity will
	pledge its interest in the financed
	vehicles as collateral for the
	securities. The lien certificates
	or certificates of title relating to
	the financed vehicles will not be
	amended or reissued to identify the
	issuing entity as the new secured
	party. In the absence of an
	amendment or reissuance, the issuing
	entity may not have a perfected
	security interest in the financed
	vehicles securing the contracts in
	some states. We or the originator
	may be obligated to repurchase any
	contract sold to the issuing entity
	which did not have a perfected
	security interest in the name of the
	originator in the financed vehicle.






	 



	 


	 





	 



	 


	We, the servicer, the originator or
	another entity may be required to
	purchase or repurchase, as
	applicable, any contract sold to the
	issuing entity as to which it failed
	to obtain or maintain a perfected
	security interest in the financed
	vehicle securing the contract. All
	of these purchases and

	repurchases
	are limited to breaches that
	materially and adversely affect the
	interests of the issuing entity or
	the securityholders in the contract
	and are subject to the expiration of
	a cure period. If the issuing
	entity has failed to obtain or
	maintain a perfected security
	interest in a financed vehicle, its
	security interest would be
	subordinate to, among others, a
	bankruptcy trustee of the obligor, a
	subsequent purchaser of the financed
	vehicle or a holder of a perfected
	security interest in the financed
	vehicle or a bankruptcy trustee of
	such holder. If the issuing entity
	elects to attempt to repossess the
	related financed vehicle, it might
	not be able to realize any
	liquidation proceeds on the financed
	vehicle and, as a result, you may
	suffer a loss on your investment in
	the securities.






	 



	 


	 






	The failure of contracts to comply
	with consumer protection laws may
	result in losses on your investment.




	 


	Federal and state consumer
	protection laws regulate the
	creation, collection and enforcement
	of consumer contracts such as the
	contracts. These laws impose
	specific statutory liabilities upon
	creditors who fail to comply with
	their provisions. Although the
	liability of the issuing entity to
	the obligor for violations of
	applicable federal and state
	consumer laws may be limited, these
	laws may make an assignee of a
	contract, such as the issuing
	entity, liable to the obligor for
	any violation by the lender. Under
	certain circumstances, the liability
	of the issuing entity to the obligor
	for violations of applicable Federal
	and state consumer protection laws
	may be limited by the applicable
	law. In some cases, this liability
	could affect an assignees ability
	to enforce its rights related to
	secured loans such as the contracts.
	We or the originator may be
	obligated to repurchase from the
	issuing entity any contract that
	fails to comply with these legal
	requirements. If we or the
	originator fails to repurchase that
	contract, you might experience
	delays or reductions in payments on
	your securities. See

	Material
	Legal Aspects of the Contracts 
	Consumer Protection Laws

	in this
	prospectus.






	 



	 


	 






	Changes to federal or state
	bankruptcy or debtor relief laws and
	other restrictions of law may impede
	collection efforts or alter timing
	and amount of collections, which may
	result in acceleration of or
	reduction in payment on your notes.




	 


	If an obligor sought protection
	under federal or state bankruptcy or
	debtor relief laws, a court could
	reduce or discharge completely the
	obligors obligations to repay
	amounts due on its contract. As a
	result, that contract would be
	written off as uncollectible. You
	could suffer a loss if no funds are
	available from credit enhancement or
	other sources and finance charge
	amounts allocated to the notes are
	insufficient to cover the applicable
	default amount. Furthermore, most
	states impose requirements and
	restrictions on foreclosure sales of
	vehicles and on obtaining deficiency
	judgments relating to such sales.
	The issuing entity may not realize
	the full amount due on a contract
	because application of those
	requirements and restrictions may
	create delays during which the
	financed vehicle may suffer damage
	or loss. The servicers credit and
	collection policy and the sale and
	servicing agreement do not require
	the servicer to force place
	collision and comprehensive
	insurance if the obligors fail to
	maintain such insurance.






	 



	 


	 






	Bankruptcy of the depositor or the
	originator could result in delays in
	payments or losses on your
	securities.




	 


	The originator intends that each
	contribution of contracts to the
	depositor will be a valid transfer
	and assignment of the contracts to
	the depositor. The depositor
	intends that its sale of the
	contracts to the issuing entity will
	be a valid transfer and assignment
	of the contracts to the issuing
	entity. If the originator or the
	depositor were to become a debtor in
	a bankruptcy case and a creditor or
	trustee-in-bankruptcy of the
	depositor or the originator were to
	take the position that the sale of
	contracts by the originator to the
	depositor or by the depositor to the
	issuing entity, as the case may be,
	should instead be treated as a
	pledge of the contracts to secure a
	borrowing of the depositor or the
	originator, delays in payments of
	collections on the contracts to you
	could occur. If a court ruled in
	favor of any such trustee, debtor or
	creditor, the court could reduce the
	amount payable to the issuing

	entity, which could result in losses
	in the securities. If the transfer
	of contracts by the originator to
	the depositor or by the depositor to
	the issuing entity is treated as a
	pledge instead of a sale, a tax or
	governmental lien on the property of
	the originator or the depositor, as
	applicable, arising before the
	transfer of the contracts to the
	issuing entity may have priority
	over the issuing entitys interest
	in those contracts. If the
	transactions are treated as
	transfers, the contracts would not
	be part of the originators or the
	depositors bankruptcy estate, as
	applicable, and would not be
	available to the depositors or the
	originators creditors.






	 



	 


	 






	The originator, the servicer and the
	depositor have limited obligations
	to the issuing entity and will not
	make payments on the securities.




	 


	The originator, the servicer, the
	depositor and their affiliates are
	not obligated to make any payments
	to you on your securities. The
	originator, the servicer, the
	depositor and their affiliates do
	not guarantee payments on the
	contracts or your securities.
	However, the originator and the
	depositor will make representations
	and warranties about the
	characteristics of the contracts.
	If a representation or warranty made
	by the originator with respect to a
	contract is untrue, or if the
	originator breaches a covenant with
	respect to a contract, then we or
	the originator may be required to
	repurchase that contract. If we or
	the originator fails to repurchase
	that contract, you might experience
	delays and/or reductions in payments
	on the securities. In addition, in
	some circumstances, the servicer may
	be required to purchase contracts.
	If the servicer fails to purchase
	contracts, you might experience
	delays and/or reductions in payments
	on your securities. See

	The
	Transaction Documents  Payments and
	Distributions on the Securities

	in
	this prospectus.






	 



	 


	 






	Interests of other persons in the
	contracts and financed vehicles
	could be superior to the issuing
	entitys interest, which may result
	in reduced payments on your
	securities.




	 


	The issuing entity could lose the
	priority of its security interest in
	a financed vehicle due to, among
	other things, liens for repairs or
	storage of a financed vehicle or for
	unpaid taxes of an obligor. None of
	we, the servicer, the originator or
	any other entity will have any
	obligation to purchase or
	repurchase, respectively, a contract
	if these liens result in the loss of
	the priority of the security
	interest in the financed vehicle
	after the issuance of securities by
	the issuing entity. Generally, no
	action will be taken to perfect the
	rights of the issuing entity in
	proceeds of any insurance policies
	covering individual financed
	vehicles or obligors. Therefore,
	the rights of a third party with an
	interest in the proceeds could
	prevail against the rights of the
	issuing entity prior to the time the
	proceeds are deposited by the
	servicer into an account controlled
	by the trustee for the securities.
	See

	Material Legal Aspects of the
	Contracts  Security Interests in
	the Financed Vehicles

	in this
	prospectus.






	 



	 


	 






	Commingling of assets by the
	servicer could reduce or delay
	payments on the securities.




	 


	The servicer will be required to
	deposit all collections and proceeds
	of the contracts collected during
	each collection period into the
	collection account within two
	business days of receipt. Until
	these funds have been deposited into
	the collection account, the servicer
	may use and invest these funds at
	its own risk and for its own benefit
	and will not segregate them from its
	own funds. The indenture trustee
	may not have a perfected interest in
	these amounts, and thus payment
	could be delayed or reduced if the
	servicer were to become subject to a
	bankruptcy proceeding. Further, if
	the servicer were unable to remit
	such funds, the securityholders
	might incur a loss.

	Extensions and deferrals of payments
	on contracts could increase the
	average life of the securities.




	 


	In some circumstances, the servicer
	may permit an extension on or
	deferral of payments due on
	contracts on a case-by-case basis.
	In addition, the servicer may from
	time to time offer obligors an
	opportunity to defer payments. Any
	of these deferrals or extensions may
	extend the maturity of the contracts
	and increase the weighted average
	life of the securities. The
	weighted average life and yield on
	your securities may be adversely
	affected by extensions and deferrals
	on the contracts. However, the
	servicer must purchase the contract
	from the issuing entity if any
	payment deferral of a contract
	extends the term of the contract
	beyond the latest final scheduled
	payment date for any class of
	related securities or breaches other
	tests described in the applicable
	prospectus supplement.






	 



	 


	 






	The application of the
	Servicemembers Civil Relief Act may
	lead to delays in payment or losses
	on your securities.




	 


	In some circumstances, the
	Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, as
	amended, or similar state
	legislation may limit the interest
	payable on a contract during an
	obligors period of active military
	duty. This legislation could
	adversely affect the ability of the
	servicer to collect full amounts of
	interest on a contract as well as to
	foreclose on an affected contract
	during, and in certain
	circumstances, after the obligors
	period of active military duty.
	This legislation may thus cause
	delays and losses in payments to
	holders of the securities. See

	Material Legal Aspects of the
	Contracts  Servicemembers Civil
	Relief Act

	in this prospectus.






	 



	 


	 






	The absence of a secondary market
	for the securities could limit your
	ability to resell your securities.




	 


	If you want to sell your securities
	you must locate a purchaser that is
	willing to purchase those
	securities. The underwriters intend
	to make a secondary market for the
	securities. The underwriters will
	do so by offering to buy the
	securities from investors who wish
	to sell. However, the underwriters
	will not be obligated to make offers
	to buy the securities and may stop
	making offers at any time. In
	addition, the prices offered, if
	any, may not reflect prices that
	other potential purchasers would be
	willing to pay, were they to be
	given the opportunity. There have
	been times in the past where there
	have been very few buyers of
	asset-backed securities, and there
	may be these times again in the
	future. As a result, you may not be
	able to sell your securities when
	you want to do so, or you may not be
	able to obtain the price that you
	wish to receive.






	 



	 


	 






	You may not be able to exercise your
	rights as a securityholder directly.




	 


	Each class of securities of a given
	series will be initially represented
	by one or more certificates
	registered in the name of Cede &
	Co., or any other nominee for The
	Depository Trust Company set forth
	in the applicable prospectus
	supplement and will not be
	registered in the names of the
	holders of the securities of such
	series or their nominees. Persons
	acquiring beneficial ownership
	interests in any series of
	securities may hold their interests
	through The Depository Trust Company
	in the United States or Clearstream
	Bank, société anonyme or the
	Euroclear System in Europe. Because
	of this, unless and until definitive
	securities for such series are
	issued, holders of such securities
	will not be recognized by the
	issuing entity or any trustee or
	indenture trustee as
	certificateholders or noteholders,
	as the case may be. Until
	definitive securities are issued,
	holders of such securities will only
	be able to exercise the rights of
	noteholders and certificateholders
	indirectly through The Depository
	Trust Company and its participating
	organizations. See

	The Securities
	 Book-Entry Registration, Global
	Clearance, Settlement and Tax
	Documentation Procedures

	in this
	prospectus.






	 



	 


	 






	Your share of possible losses may
	not be proportional.




	 


	Principal payments of the securities
	generally will be made to the
	holders of the securities
	sequentially so that no principal
	will be paid on any class of the
	securities until each class of
	securities with an earlier final scheduled

	payment date has been paid
	in full. As a result, a class of
	securities with a later maturity may
	absorb more losses than a class of
	securities with an earlier maturity.




	 
















	The ratings for the securities are
	limited in scope, may not continue
	to be issued and do not consider the
	suitability of the securities for
	you.




	 


	We will offer a class of securities
	only if that class receives the
	rating specified in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. The rating
	considers only the likelihood that
	the issuing entity will pay interest
	on time and will ultimately pay
	principal in full or make full
	distributions of the outstanding
	principal balance of the security or
	the final scheduled payment date. A
	security rating is not a
	recommendation to buy, sell or hold
	the securities. The rating agencies
	may revise or withdraw the ratings
	at any time without notice from the
	issuing entity, the depositor or
	Santander Consumer. Ratings on the

	CAPITALIZED TERMS



	     The capitalized terms used in this prospectus, unless defined elsewhere in this prospectus,
	have the meanings set forth in the glossary at the end of this prospectus.







	THE ISSUING ENTITIES







	     With respect to each series of securities the depositor, Santander Drive Auto Receivables LLC,
	a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Santander
	Consumer, will establish a separate issuing entity that will issue the securities of that series.
	Each issuing entity will be either a Delaware statutory trust formed pursuant to a trust agreement
	between the depositor and the trustee specified in the applicable prospectus supplement for that
	issuing entity or a common law trust in each case, established to issue the related series of notes
	and/or certificates, as specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. The fiscal year end of
	the issuing entity will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. The depositor will
	sell and assign the contracts and other specified Issuing Entity Property to the issuing entity in
	exchange for the securities of that issuing entity.






	     The issuing entity may issue notes and/or certificates, in one or more classes, in amounts, at
	prices and on terms to be determined at the time of sale and to be set forth in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. The notes and/or certificates of a series are collectively referred to as
	securities. Any notes that are issued will represent indebtedness of the issuing entity and will
	be issued and secured pursuant to an indenture between the issuing entity and the indenture trustee
	specified in the applicable prospectus supplement. Any certificates that are issued will represent
	beneficial interests in that issuing entity.


	     In addition to and to the extent specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the
	property of each issuing entity may include (collectively as follows, the

	Issuing Entity
	Property

	):





	 



	



	 


	the contracts and all monies due thereunder after the applicable Cut-Off Date;




	 




	 



	



	 


	security interests in the financed vehicles, all certificates of title to these
	financed vehicles and any related accessions;




	 




	 



	



	 


	any proceeds under certain insurance policies covering the financed vehicles or
	the obligors relating to the contracts and any proceeds from the liquidation of the
	contracts or the financed vehicles;




	 




	 



	



	 


	rights under the applicable transfer documents;




	 




	 



	



	 


	any dealer recourse relating to the contracts;




	 




	 



	



	 


	certain rebates of premiums and other amounts relating to insurance policies in
	effect as of the applicable Cut-Off Date;




	 




	 



	



	 


	the accounts owned by the issuing entity and the amounts on deposit in these accounts;




	 




	 



	



	 


	the contract files; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	the proceeds of any and all of the above.





	     To the extent specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, an insurance policy, surety
	bond, letter of credit, reserve account or other form of credit enhancement or liquidity may be a
	part of the property of any given issuing entity or may be held by the trustee or the indenture
	trustee for the benefit of holders of the related securities. To the extent specified in the
	applicable prospectus supplement, an interest rate swap, interest rate cap or guaranteed



	9









	Table of Contents





	investment contract may also be a part of the property of any given issuing entity or may be
	held by the trustee or the indenture trustee for the benefit of holders of the related securities.


	     If so provided in the applicable prospectus supplement, the Issuing Entity Property may also
	include a pre-funding account, into which the depositor will deposit cash from the proceeds of the
	sale of the securities and which will be used by the issuing entity to purchase contracts from the
	originator during a specified period following the Closing Date for the related series of
	securities. Any contracts so conveyed to an issuing entity will also be Issuing Entity Property of
	the issuing entity.


	     Prior to formation, each issuing entity will have no assets or obligations. After formation,
	each issuing entity will not engage in any activity other than acquiring and holding the related
	contracts and the Issuing Entity Property, issuing the related securities, distributing payments in
	respect thereof and any other activities described in this prospectus, in the applicable prospectus
	supplement and in the trust agreement or limited liability company agreement of the issuing entity,
	as applicable. Each issuing entity will not acquire any contracts or assets other than the Issuing
	Entity Property.







	THE TRUSTEE



	     The trustee for any issuing entity that is a trust will be specified in the applicable
	prospectus supplement. The trustees liability in connection with the issuance and sale of the
	related securities is limited solely to the express obligations of the trustee set forth in the
	related trust agreement. The trustee may resign at any time, in which event the administrator, or
	the depositor, will be obligated to appoint a successor trustee. The depositor or administrator of
	each issuing entity may also remove the trustee if:





	 



	



	 


	the trustee ceases to be eligible to continue as trustee under the related trust agreement; or




	 




	 



	



	 


	the trustee becomes insolvent.





	     In either of these circumstances, the depositor or administrator must appoint a successor
	trustee. If the trustee resigns or is removed, the resignation or removal and appointment of a
	successor trustee will not become effective until the successor trustee accepts its appointment.
	The depositor will provide (or cause to be provided) notice of such resignation or removal to the
	rating agencies.


	     The principal offices of each issuing entity and the related trustee will be specified in the
	applicable prospectus supplement.







	THE CONTRACTS




	The Contracts



	     The contracts consist of certain retail installment sales contracts and/or installment loans.
	These contracts are secured by new and used automobiles, light-duty trucks, vans, mini-vans and
	motorcycles. The contracts to be transferred to any issuing entity have been or will be purchased
	or originated by the originator. See

	Origination and Servicing Procedures

	in this prospectus.



	The Contracts Pools



	     The contracts to be purchased by each issuing entity, also known as the

	contracts pool,

	will
	be selected by the depositor based upon the satisfaction of several criteria, including that each
	contract:





	 



	



	 


	is secured by a financed vehicle that contractually was required to be insured;




	 




	 



	



	 


	was originated in the United States;






	10









	Table of Contents








	 



	



	 


	provides for level monthly payments which provide interest at the weighted
	average percentage rate and fully amortize the amount advanced under the contract
	toward the purchase price of the financed vehicle and any related costs over an
	original term to scheduled maturity specified in the applicable transaction document;




	 




	 



	



	 


	is attributable to the purchase of and secured by a new or used automobile,
	light duty truck, van, motorcycle or mini-van;




	 




	 



	



	 


	as of the applicable cut-off date has a remaining term to scheduled maturity
	specified in the applicable transaction document;




	 




	 



	



	 


	is not more than 30 days delinquent on the related cut-off date; and




	 




	 



	



	 


	satisfies any additional criteria specified in the applicable prospectus supplement.





	     The depositor will not use any selection procedures in selecting the contracts for each
	contracts pool that are materially adverse to the securityholders of that series.


	     The depositor will sell or transfer contracts having an aggregate outstanding principal
	balance specified in the applicable prospectus supplement as of the applicable cut-off date to the
	applicable issuing entity. The purchase price paid by each issuing entity for each contract
	included in the Issuing Entity Property of the issuing entity will reflect the outstanding
	principal balance of the contract as of the applicable cut-off date.


	     Additional information with respect to the contracts pool securing each series of securities
	will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement including, to the extent appropriate, the
	composition of the contracts, the distribution of annual percentage rates, the distribution by the
	states where the obligors reside and the portion of the contracts pool secured by new or used
	vehicles.







	ORIGINATION AND SERVICING PROCEDURES



	     The following is a description of the origination, underwriting and servicing of retail
	installment sales contracts by the originator as of the date of this prospectus. The applicable
	prospectus supplement will describe any material changes to this information with respect to the
	origination, underwriting and servicing of the pool of contracts transferred to the related issuing
	entity and will designate the entity acting as servicer with respect to that particular
	transaction.


	     The originator originates or acquires contracts through a variety of origination channels
	across a spectrum of credit quality obligors. Non-prime contracts, in general, are expected to
	have higher loss rates and may have higher delinquency rates than contracts that represent the
	obligations of prime credit obligors.



	Origination




	Contracts and Calculation Methods



	     The standard contract originated or purchased by the originator is a fully amortizing, fixed
	level monthly payment contract which will amortize the full amount of the contract over its term,
	assuming that the obligor does not pay any installment after its due date. Each contract provides
	for the allocation of payments according to the simple interest method of allocating a fixed
	level payment on an obligation between principal and interest, pursuant to which the portion of
	such payment that is allocated to interest is equal to the product of the fixed rate of interest on
	such obligation, multiplied by the unpaid principal balance multiplied by the period of time
	(expressed as a fraction of a year, based on the actual number of days in the calendar month and
	365 days in the calendar year) elapsed since the preceding payment under which the obligation was
	made and the remainder of such payment is allocable to principal.



	11









	Table of Contents





	     Under the simple interest method, payments on contracts are applied first to interest accrued
	through the date immediately preceding the date of payment and then to unpaid principal.
	Accordingly, if an obligor pays an installment before its due date, the portion of the payment
	allocable to interest for the payment period will be less than if the payment had been made on the
	due date, the portion of the payment applied to reduce the principal balance will be
	correspondingly greater, and the principal balance will be amortized more rapidly than scheduled.
	Conversely, if an obligor pays an installment after its due date, the portion of the payment
	allocable to interest for the payment period will be greater than if the payment had been made on
	the due date, the portion of the payment applied to reduce the principal balance will be
	correspondingly less, and the principal balance will be amortized more slowly than scheduled.


	     The contract term is determined by a number of factors which may include the age and mileage
	of the financed vehicle. Interest rates may be determined on the basis of the credit quality of
	the obligor and/or the maximum rate which may be charged by law. Contracts that represent the
	obligations of non-prime credit obligors interest tend to have higher interest rates than contracts
	that represent the obligations of prime credit obligors.



	Contract Origination Channels



	     The originator primarily originates contracts by purchasing motor vehicle installment sales
	contracts from dealers pursuant to a dealer agreement between the originator and the dealer.


	     In addition, the originator may originate contracts from time to time through pass-through
	arrangements in place with third parties.


	     Each dealer agreement, among other things, sets out the guidelines and procedures of the
	purchasing and origination process. These dealer agreements generally provide for the repurchase
	by the dealer of any contract for its outstanding principal balance, plus accrued but unpaid
	interest, if any representations or warranties made by the dealer relating to the contract are
	breached. The representations and warranties typically relate to the origination of a contract and
	the security interest in the related financed vehicle and not to the collectability of the contract
	or the creditworthiness of the related obligor.


	     Under the pass through arrangements, applications that do not meet the third partys
	underwriting criteria are directed to the originator who may approve the application for funding.
	In most cases, these pass through contracts are underwritten using the same processes and
	decision models as other types of receivables originated by the originator, although the specific
	underwriting criteria and contract terms may vary among programs.



	Underwriting



	     Credit underwriters have the ability to structure some contracts individually depending upon
	the risk profile of the obligor, with particular emphasis on the following underwriting criteria:
	(i) collateral type and quality; (ii) loan to value ratio (

	LTV

	); (iii) cash down payment; (iv)
	affordability (payment to income and debt to income); (v) obligor stability; and (vi) term.
	Ordinarily contracts are approved based upon the originators pricing and origination guidelines
	but underwriters have limited ability to approve exceptions. The total number of exceptions made
	by any one underwriter cannot exceed 5% of that underwriters monthly originations. Any exception
	to the underwriting guidelines must be approved by the underwriters supervisor.



	Credit Risk Management



	     

	Overview



	     The originators credit risk management department is responsible for monitoring origination
	activities and portfolio performance and supporting senior operations management. The department
	monitors and analyzes loan applicant and credit bureau data, credit score information, loan
	structures and pricing terms. The department is responsible for developing the originators credit
	scorecards and monitoring their performance.



	12









	Table of Contents





	     The credit risk management department monitors portfolio performance at a variety of levels
	including total company, market and dealer. The analysis of the results are the basis for ongoing
	changes to origination strategies including credit policy, risk-based pricing programs and eventual
	changes to the scoring system. The department also monitors adherence to underwriting guidelines.


	     

	Credit Scoring



	     The originator utilizes a proprietary credit scoring system to support the credit decision
	process and to differentiate applicant credit risk. Based on this risk-ranking, the originator
	determines the expected default rate for each applicant and is able to rank order credit risk
	accordingly, which enables the originator to evaluate credit applications for approval and tailor
	loan pricing and structure.


	     The credit scoring system was developed utilizing a statistical analysis of the originators
	consumer origination data, pooled data purchased from the national credit bureaus and subsequent
	portfolio performance. Prior to fourth quarter 2005, the originator did not use credit scoring to
	assess credit applications.


	     The credit scoring system considers data contained in the applicants credit application and
	credit bureau report as well as the structure of the proposed contract and produces a statistical
	assessment of these attributes. This assessment is used to segregate applicant risk profiles and
	determine whether risk is acceptable and the price the originator should charge for that risk. The
	originators credit scorecards are monitored through comparison of actual versus projected
	performance by score. While the originator employs a credit scoring system in the credit approval
	process, credit scoring does not eliminate credit risk.


	     

	Pricing Model



	     The originator utilizes a proprietary pricing model to develop risk-based pricing programs and
	credit policy, subject to corporate goals and constraints including credit losses and
	profitability. A score cut-off was introduced in the first quarter of 2006 for applicants with the
	lowest scores where profit thresholds are not met. Applicants scoring above the cut-off are
	underwritten against the risk-based pricing programs.


	     

	Funding



	     Completed contract packages are sent by the dealers to the originator. Key documentation is
	scanned to create electronic images and electronically forwarded to the originators centralized
	contract processing department. The original documents are subsequently sent to an outsourced
	storage location and stored in a fire resistant vault.


	     Upon electronic receipt of contract documentation, the contract processing department reviews
	the contract packages for proper documentation and regulatory compliance and completes the entry of
	information into the companys loan accounting system. Once cleared for funding, the contract
	processing department electronically transfers funds to the dealer or issues a check. Upon funding
	of the contract, the originator acquires a perfected security interest in the motor vehicle that
	was financed.



	Servicing



	     

	Overview







	     Santander Consumer USA Inc. will be the servicer. All servicing and processing for the
	contracts will be performed by the servicer. The servicer will have the right to delegate certain
	servicing and processing responsibilities of the contracts to another entity pursuant to the
	applicable sale and servicing agreement. The servicer will be responsible for billing, collecting,
	accounting and posting all payments received with respect to the contracts, responding to obligor
	inquiries, taking steps to maintain the security interest granted in the financed vehicles or other
	collateral, coordinating the ongoing liquidation of repossessed collateral, and generally
	monitoring each contract and the related collateral. The servicing is closely integrated with the
	origination platform of the originator. This results in the efficient exchange of information
	which aids both servicing and evaluation and modification of product design and underwriting
	criteria.

	Table of Contents





	     

	Collections



	     Collections are performed at the servicing center in Dallas, Texas. The servicing practices
	associated with non-prime contracts include: (i) placing reminder calls to new obligors three days
	prior to the first three payment due dates; (ii) attempting telephonic communication with all
	obligors one day after a missed payment; (iii) making evening and weekend collection calls; and
	(iv) continuing to make calls at least once a day until contact is made. In cases where an obligor
	has broken a promise to make a payment on a certain date, such obligor is called within a day. If
	the collection department is unsuccessful in contacting an obligor by phone, alternative methods of
	contact, such as location gathering via references, employers, landlords, credit bureaus or cross
	directories are pursued, generally within one to ten days of the account becoming delinquent.


	     The servicer uses monthly billing statements to serve as a reminder to obligors as well as an
	early warning mechanism in the event an obligor has failed to notify the servicer of an address
	change. Payments are received in the mail or through a lockbox. In addition to mailing in
	payments, obligors may make payments via the Internet, an interactive voice response system, third
	party payment processing services and verbally with the originators customer service and
	collections staff. Credit and debit cards are also accepted.


	     On a daily basis, the servicers integrated servicing system automatically forwards accounts
	to its automated dialer as well as its standard collections system based upon risk and projected
	loss severity. Risk assessment directs several courses of action, including delaying collection
	activity based upon the likelihood of self curing, directing an account to our automated dialer or
	forwarding the account for accelerated/specialty treatment (i.e. bankruptcy, repossessions,
	impounded units, skip tracing, etc.). To assist in the collection process, the servicers
	collection staff has the ability to access original contract documents through its imaging system,
	as well as having the availability to offer a due date change, deferment (three within the life of
	the loan) and in rare cases a hardship re-write.


	     The collection process is divided into stages. Early stage collections services contracts
	that are normally less than 40 days delinquent. The servicer outsources servicing on a portion of
	contracts at the earliest stages of delinquency (less than 20 days delinquent). These obligors are
	then called by a predictive dialer. Once a live voice responds to the automated dialers call, the
	system automatically transfers the call to a collector while simultaneously delivering the relevant
	account information to the collectors computer screen. Mid stage collections services contracts
	that are normally 40 to 60 days delinquent. Contracts within this stage are worked by an advanced
	collection unit that provides light skip work, as well as enhanced negotiating skills. The
	objective of mid stage collections is to limit the number of contracts that roll to late stage
	delinquency, as well as to mitigate loss. Late stage collections services contracts that are
	normally greater than 60 days delinquent. Contracts within this stage are worked by the servicers
	most experienced collectors. Late stage collectors employ heavy skip tracing and negotiating
	skills to determine the collectability of the contract. If the delinquency is not cured,
	repossession of the vehicle may be recommended, usually by the 90

	th

	day of delinquency.


	     At times, the servicer, in accordance with its servicing policies, offers payment deferrals or
	extensions to obligors who have encountered temporary financial difficulty. The collector reviews
	the obligors past payment history to assess the obligors desire and capacity to make future
	payments. The servicer also utilizes an internally generated behavior score to aid the collector
	in making the decision. The servicer currently utilizes an industry-standard deferment policy. A
	collector must obtain a written or recorded acknowledgment from the obligor before granting a
	deferral. No deferrals may be granted until at least six scheduled payments have been received
	under the related contract, and thereafter only one extension, not to exceed one month, may be
	granted each 12 months. No more than three extensions are permitted on any one contract.
	Exceptions to the deferral policy, including hardship re-writes, are limited and require management
	approval.


	     

	Charge-off Policy



	     

	Repossessions

	Contracts related to repossessed vehicles are charged off in the month during
	which the earliest of any of the following occurs: (a) liquidation of the repossessed vehicle; (b)
	91 days following the vehicles repossession date; and (c) 121 days of contractual delinquency.
	The amount of the initial charge-off shall be equal to the then current outstanding contract
	principal balance less: (i) the sum of the proceeds from the disposition of the vehicle, net of
	the costs incurred in repossession, storing and disposing of the vehicle; and (ii) an



	14









	Table of Contents





	estimated amount for warranty and insurance refunds to be received later. The initial
	charge-off may be adjusted for additional recoveries or charge-offs, to reflect the actual proceeds
	received from rebates or the cancellation of outstanding insurance policies and/or extended service
	contracts.


	     

	Bankruptcies

	If a notice of bankruptcy with respect to a contract is received, the contract
	will be charged off (at the time described in the next sentence) in an amount equal to the current
	outstanding principal balance of the account at the time of the notice. The charge-off will be
	made upon the earlier to occur of (a) the month in which the borrower is 121 days contractually
	past due or (b) receipt of notice of the results of the bankruptcy proceeding, indicating that a
	charge-off or adjustment for a cram down is appropriate. Any notice of the result of a
	bankruptcy proceeding received after the contract is charged-off will result in the reinstatement
	of the contract under the new terms or the recovered vehicle being sold following repossession, as
	appropriate. The resulting write-backs will be treated as recoveries.


	     

	Skips

	A skip, an account for which the servicer has been unsuccessful in locating either
	the obligor or the financed vehicle, charged off in an amount equal to the then current outstanding
	principal balance of the contract in the month the account becomes 91 days contractually
	delinquent. If continued collection efforts result in subsequent contact with the obligor or the
	financed vehicle, the financed vehicle is repossessed and sold, and proceeds from the disposition
	of the collateral, net of the costs incurred in the repossessing, storing and disposing of the
	vehicle, and/or rebates from the cancellation of the outstanding insurance policies and/or extended
	service contracts are recorded as recoveries.


	     

	Thefts or collisions

	Theft or collision accounts are charged off upon the earlier to occur
	of: (a) receipt of proceeds from an obligors insurance policy or (b) the month in which the
	account becomes contractually 121 days delinquent. The charge-off is equal to the then current
	outstanding balance of the contract. Insurance proceeds received after an account is charged-off
	are recorded as recoveries.


	     Contracts are placed in non-accrual status when they are greater than 60 days delinquent.
	Accrued and unpaid interest is reversed at the time the contract is placed in non-accrual status.
	Charged-off contracts are pursued for any deficiencies by the servicer until such time as it is
	judged that no further recoveries can be effected. The servicer has the ability to establish
	payment schedules for deficiencies and/or negotiate lump sum settlements of deficiencies. However,
	the servicer will be subject to certain limitations in the sale and servicing agreement with
	respect to any modifications of the contracts.


	     

	Repossessions



	     Repossessions are subject to prescribed legal procedures, which include peaceful repossession,
	one or more obligor notifications, a prescribed waiting period prior to disposition of the
	repossessed automobile and return of personal items to the obligor. Some jurisdictions provide the
	obligor with reinstatement or redemption rights. Repossessions are handled by independent
	repossession firms managed by Repossessions Consolidator companies contracted by the servicer.
	All repossessions, other than those relating to bankrupt accounts or previously charged-off
	accounts, must be approved by a collections manager. Upon repossession and after any prescribed
	waiting period, the repossessed automobile is sold at auction. The proceeds from the sale of the
	automobile at auction, and any other recoveries, are credited against the balance of the contract.
	Auction proceeds from sale of the repossessed vehicle and other recoveries are usually not
	sufficient to cover the outstanding balance of the contract, and the resulting deficiency is
	charged-off. The services pursues collection of deficiencies when it deems such action to be
	appropriate.


	     The decision to repossess a vehicle is influenced by many factors, such as previous contract
	history, reasons for delinquency, and cooperation of the obligor. As part of the collection
	process, all practical means of contacting the obligor are attempted. If at any point a collector
	feels that there is little or no chance of establishing contact with the obligor, or that the
	obligor will not make the required payments, the collector will submit such contract for
	repossession. All contracts submitted are evaluated by collection supervisors to determine if
	additional follow-up work is needed prior to repossession. If the collection supervisors recommend
	repossession, those contracts are sent to the special collections department who makes one more
	attempt to contact the obligor to ensure that repossession is absolutely necessary. If no progress
	is made, then the account is assigned for repossession. The decision to repossess will generally
	be made when the loan becomes approximately 90 days delinquent.

	Table of Contents





	     Once the decision to repossess a vehicle is made, the account is referred to an outside agency
	that handles the actual repossession. Most state laws require that the obligor be sent a Notice
	of Intent to Sell, which informs the obligor of the lenders intent to sell the repossessed
	vehicle. The various states provide for a period of time, generally 15 to 20 days, during which
	the obligor may have the right, depending on the applicable statute, to either reinstate the
	contract by making all past due payments and paying the repossession and storage expenses of the
	vehicle or by paying the contract in full. If the obligor does not exercise his right to reinstate
	the contract or redeem the vehicle, as provided by the applicable statute, the vehicle is sold at
	public auction or at a private sale. Prior to the sale, a repossessed vehicle undergoes evaluation
	and, if necessary, extensive reconditioning is performed in order to maximize recovery value. The
	vehicle is usually sold within 30 to 60 days after being repossessed. After the Notice of Intent
	to Sell expiration date, applications are made for rebates on any extended warranty or life,
	accident and health insurance policies that may have been financed as part of the vehicle purchase.


	     

	Perfection of Security Interests







	     Each contract contains a sale assignment with a clause granting the originator a security
	interest in the related financed vehicle. In each state in which the originator does business, a
	security interest is perfected by noting the secured partys interest on the financed vehicles
	certificate of title. Santander Consumer is, or Drive FS was recorded as lienholder on the
	financed vehicle titles. The dealer is required to complete the title work and take all the steps
	required to perfect the originators security interest. The contract is subject to repurchase by
	the originator if the title is not registered in the name of the originator or the originators
	security interest is not perfected.






	     The servicers quality control procedures include a title tracking system used to review and
	track title processing by dealers and state authorities until such time as the certificate of title
	has been received.


	     

	Insurance



	     Initially, all of the contracts owned by the issuing entity are covered by physical damage
	insurance policies maintained by the obligors and the originator is named as loss payee. The
	servicer does not use force-placed insurance if an obligor fails to maintain any required
	insurance. Since obligors may choose their own insurers to provide the required coverage, the
	specific terms and conditions of their policies may vary.


	     

	Prior Securitization Transactions







	     The servicers specific servicing policies and practices may change over time. None of the
	securitization transactions of Drive FS, the predecessor of Santander Consumer, or Santander
	Consumer have experienced early amortizations, servicer defaults or events of default. Certain
	contract performance triggers (relating to net losses, extensions and delinquencies) and financial
	covenants in certain securitization transactions sponsored by Drive FS that were negotiated
	privately with insurers have been breached, but all such breaches have been waived and/or cured
	and/or the triggers or covenants have been modified. Neither Santander Consumer nor the issuing
	entity can guarantee that there will not be any breaches of performance triggers, early
	amortizations, servicer defaults or events of default in the future.











	PRE-FUNDING ARRANGEMENT



	     To the extent provided in the applicable prospectus supplement for a series of securities, the
	related transfer agreement or indenture may provide for a pre-funding arrangement which will be
	limited to a period not to exceed twelve months. Under the pre-funding arrangement, the related
	issuing entity commits to purchase additional contracts from the depositor following the date on
	which the related securities are issued. With respect to a series of securities, the pre-funding
	arrangement will require that any subsequent contracts transferred to the issuing entity conform to
	the requirements and conditions in the related transfer agreement, including all of the same
	eligibility criteria as the initial contracts. If a pre-funding arrangement is utilized in
	connection with the issuance of a series of securities, the servicer will establish an account,
	known as the pre-funding account, in the name of the indenture trustee for the benefit of the
	securityholders. Up to 50% of the proceeds received from the sale of the securities may be
	deposited into the pre-funding account on the related Closing Date and thereafter funds will be
	released on one or



	16









	Table of Contents





	more occasions during a specified period to purchase subsequent contracts from the depositor.
	Upon each conveyance of subsequent contracts to the applicable issuing entity, an amount equal to
	the purchase price paid by the depositor to the originator for the subsequent contracts will be
	released from the pre-funding account and paid to the depositor. If funds remain in the
	pre-funding account at the end of the pre-funding period, those funds will be applied to prepay the
	securities in the manner set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement. Amounts on deposit in
	the prefunding account may be invested in Eligible Investments. Information regarding the
	subsequent contracts will be included under Item 8.01 in a Current Report filed by the issuing
	entity on Form 8-K with the SEC pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
	(the

	Exchange Act

	).


	     The utilization of a pre-funding arrangement for a series of securities is intended to improve
	the efficiency of the issuance of the securities and the sale of the contracts to the related
	issuing entity through the incremental delivery of the applicable contracts on the Closing Date and
	during a specified period following the Closing Date for that series of securities. Pre-funding
	arrangements allow for a more even accumulation of the contracts by the originator and the issuance
	of a larger principal amount of securities than would be the case without a pre-funding
	arrangement.


	     You should be aware that the initial contracts and the subsequent contracts may be originated
	using credit criteria different from the criteria applied to the contracts disclosed in the
	applicable prospectus supplement and may be of a different credit quality and seasoning. The
	credit quality of the subsequent contracts may vary as a result of increases or decreases in the
	credit quality of the related obligors within the predefined acceptable range, which variations
	could impact the performance of the overall pool of contracts. The portfolio of initial contracts
	may also be subject to greater seasoning than the subsequent contracts due to the length of time
	elapsed from the dates of origination of those contracts and the sale of those contracts to the
	related issuing entity. Accordingly, less historical performance information may be available with
	respect to the subsequent contracts. Moreover, following the transfer of subsequent contracts to
	the applicable issuing entity, the characteristics of the entire pool of contracts included in the
	Issuing Entity Property may vary from those of the contracts initially transferred to the issuing
	entity.







	MATURITY AND PREPAYMENT CONSIDERATIONS



	     The weighted average life of the notes and the certificates of any series will generally be
	influenced by the rate at which the principal balances of the contracts are paid, which payments
	may be in the form of scheduled payments or prepayments. Each contract is prepayable in full by
	the obligor at any time. Some contracts may require the obligor to pay a prepayment penalty if the
	obligor prepays all or a portion of the contracts. Full and partial prepayments on motor vehicle
	contracts included in the Issuing Entity Property of an issuing entity will be paid or distributed
	to the related securityholders on the next Payment Date following the Collection Period in which
	they are received. To the extent that any contract included in the Issuing Entity Property of an
	issuing entity is prepaid in full, whether by the obligor, or as the result of a purchase by the
	servicer or a repurchase by the originator or otherwise, the actual weighted average life of the
	contracts included in the Issuing Entity Property of the issuing entity will be shorter than a
	weighted average life calculation based on the assumptions that payments will be made on schedule
	and that no prepayments will be made. Weighted average life means the average amount of time until
	the entire principal amount of a contract is repaid. Full prepayments may also result from
	liquidations due to default, receipt of proceeds from theft, physical damage, credit life and
	credit disability insurance policies, repurchases by the depositor as a result of the failure of a
	contract to meet the criteria set forth in the related transaction documents as a result of a
	breach of covenants with respect to the contracts, or purchases made by the servicer as a result of
	a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant made by it related to its servicing duties in
	the related transaction documents. In addition, early retirement of the securities may be effected
	by the servicer exercising its option to purchase the remaining contracts included in the Issuing
	Entity Property of the issuing entity on any Payment Date as of which the Pool Balance, after
	giving effect to the principal payments and distributions otherwise to be made on that Payment
	Date, has declined to or below the percentage of the Original Pool Balance specified in the
	applicable prospectus supplement. See

	The Transaction Documents  Termination

	in this
	prospectus.


	     The rate of full prepayments by obligors on the contracts may be influenced by a variety of
	economic, social and other factors. These factors include the unemployment rate, servicing
	decisions, seasoning of loans, destruction of vehicles by accident, loss of vehicles due to theft,
	sales of vehicles, market interest rates, the availability of alternative financing and
	restrictions on the obligors ability to sell or transfer the financed vehicle



	17









	Table of Contents





	securing a contract without the consent of the servicer. Any full prepayments or partial
	prepayments applied immediately will reduce the average life of the contracts.


	     The originator cannot make a prediction as to the actual prepayment rates that will be
	experienced on the contracts included in the Issuing Entity Property of any issuing entity in
	either stable or changing interest rate environments. Securityholders of each series will bear all
	reinvestment risk resulting from the rate of prepayment of the contracts included in the Issuing
	Entity Property of the related issuing entity.







	NOTE FACTORS AND OTHER INFORMATION



	     Each class of notes will be assigned a

	Note Factor

	consisting of a six-digit decimal which
	the servicer will compute each month indicating the principal balance for each class of notes as a
	fraction of the initial principal balance of the corresponding class of notes. The Note Factor for
	each class of notes will be 1.000000 as of the closing date; thereafter, each Note Factor will
	decline to reflect reductions in the principal balance of each class of notes. As a noteholder,
	your share of the principal balance of a particular class of notes is the product of (1) the
	original denomination of your note and (2) the applicable class Note Factor.


	     Under the indenture, the securityholders will receive monthly reports concerning the payments
	received on the motor vehicle contracts, the aggregate contracts balance, the Note Factors and
	various other items of information. See

	Reports to Securityholders

	in this prospectus.







	POOL FACTOR AND POOL INFORMATION



	     For each issuing entity, the Pool Factor will be a six-digit decimal which the servicer will
	compute each month indicating the Pool Balance at the end of the month as a fraction of (1) the
	Original Pool Balance of contracts as of the initial cut-off date plus (2) the Original Pool
	Balance of any subsequent contracts added to the Issuing Entity Property as of the applicable
	subsequent cut-off date. The Pool Factor will be 1.000000 as of the Closing Date; thereafter, the
	Pool Factor will decline to reflect reductions in the Pool Balance. The amount of a
	securityholders pro rata share of the Pool Balance for a given month can be determined by
	multiplying the original denomination of the holders security by the Pool Factor for that month.


	     With respect to each issuing entity, the noteholders and certificateholders of record will
	receive monthly reports from the trustee or indenture trustee, as applicable, concerning payments
	received on the contracts, the Pool Balance, the Pool Factor and other relevant information. The
	Depository Trust Company (

	DTC

	) will supply these reports to securityholders in accordance with
	its procedures. Since owners of beneficial interests in a global security of a given series will
	not be recognized as noteholders and certificateholders of that series, DTC will not forward
	monthly reports to those owners. Copies of monthly reports may be obtained by owners of beneficial
	interests in a global security by a request in writing addressed to the trustee or indenture
	trustee, as applicable. Noteholders and certificateholders of record during any calendar year will
	be furnished information for tax reporting purposes not later than the latest date permitted by
	federal and/or state law. See

	The Securities  Statements to Securityholders

	in this prospectus.









	USE OF PROCEEDS



	     The net proceeds from the sale of securities of a given series will be applied by the
	depositor to (1) purchase the contracts from the originator; (2) pay the fees of credit enhancement
	providers, if applicable; (3) deposit certain amounts to the pre-funding account and to fund any
	other collateral accounts; (4) pay other expenses in connection with the issuance of the
	securities; and (5) repay certain warehouse debt. Any remaining amounts will be added to the
	depositors general funds.







	THE DEPOSITOR







	     The depositor, Santander Drive Auto Receivables LLC, a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary
	of Santander Consumer, was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of
	Delaware on February 23, 2006 as Drive Auto Receivables LLC and has a limited operating history.
	On February 20, 2007,

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Ladies and
Gentlemen:

     We
have acted as special counsel to Santander Drive Auto Receivables
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “
Seller ”), in connection with the offering of notes
(the “ Notes ”) described in the preliminary
prospectus supplement dated November 12, 2010 (the “
Preliminary Prospectus Supplement ”), the Supplement
to the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement dated November 17,
2010 (the “Supplement”) and the base prospectus dated
November 12, 2010 (the “ Base Prospectus ”,
and collectively with the Preliminary Prospectus Supplement and the
Supplement, the “ Preliminary Prospectus ”),

issuance and sale of the Notes, and have examined and relied upon
copies of such statutes, documents, corporate records and other
instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the
purposes of this opinion, including the Preliminary Prospectus and
