History[edit]
American Financial Group's major insurance division operates as the Great American Insurance Company, founded in 1872 and focuses on property and casualty insurance services. Other affiliates and subsidiaries include Great American Custom, Mid-Continent Group, National Interstate, and Republic Indemnity. Additional insurance specialties include (but are not limited to) equine, trucking, executive liability, fidelity and crime, and agribusiness. Great American Financial Resources is a wholly owned subsidiary of American Financial Group and supplies a range of annuities, life insurance products and supplemental insurances to individuals and enterprises.
The parent company, AFG, is owned principally by the family of financier Carl Lindner, Jr., who bought the company in 1973 and served as its chairman until his death in 2011. The senior Lindner's sons, Carl H. Lindner III and S. Craig Lindner serve as Co-Chief Executive Officers.
Awards, honors and publications[edit]
American Financial Group was ranked 486th on the Fortune 500 list in 2004. Through the years American Financial Group has owned a number of subsidiaries, real estate properties, and companies, including The Mountain View Grand Resort & Spa in Whitefield, New Hampshire, The Cincinnatian in Cincinnati, Ohio, The Biltmore in Coral Gables, Florida, Le Pavillon in New Orleans, Louisiana, and the Charleston Harbor Resort and Marina in Charleston, South Carolina. Great American Insurance Group partnered with the baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds, and Hamilton County to purchase naming rights for Great American Ball Park.
On December 6, 2006, American Financial sold assets acquired from successors to the dissolution of the Penn Central Railroad including the land under Grand Central Terminal and the 156 miles (251 km) of Metro North track leading to the New York City landmark to Argent Ventures. The company announced in December 2007 that they will combine their offices and move their headquarters to the brand new Great American Insurance Building at Queen City Square in 2011.
American Financial Group was one of the first publicly traded Fortune 500 companies to make political donations after corporations' freedom of speech rights were expanded to include donations as a result of the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission decision. Carl Linder, Jr is a longtime top Republican donor, comfortably donating millions of his personal income to candidates and political action committees,[4] which sent ripples in campaign finance circles during the 2010 mid-term elections. American Financial, of which Linder has a non-majority 42% share, donated $400,000 to the Republican-allied PAC American Crossroads.[5]

Craig Lindner - I Am ASEA - I Am ASEA














































































 


Craig Lindner
ASEA Double Diamond Executive

Craig Lindner was born, raised, and now lives on the big island of Hawaii. A custom home builder and real estate broker by profession, Craig has weathered the storms of being involved in both the real estate and construction industries in Hawaii. For him, ASEA is a solid foundation because he knows that his returns will equal or exceed his efforts. More importantly, Craig knows that with ASEA, his ability to help others is magnified.
Living on the beautiful island of Hawaii is a dream, come true; however, living in a place that’s a prime tourist destination also creates a unique economic climate with its own set of challenges. “We’re isolated on a little island and the only way to generate enough income is to go out of state or to work more than one job,” says Craig.
For 20 years, he was a custom home builder and real estate broker. “I worked too much, drank too much, slept too little, ate poorly, and didn’t enjoy my work or the people I was working with. It didn’t seem like there was any way out,” he says. For those 20 years, Craig was in a cycle—he would build a house, sell it, and then have to start over again. “Then the housing market changed and we couldn’t get loans or lines of credit, and mortgages were impossible to get,” he adds.
That’s when everything began to change for Craig. He was at a materials supply store and the store representative, who was a friend of his, told him about a new product. “I had never seen her that excited about anything,” he says. “She gave me a bottle of ASEA and I signed up.” After just three weeks, Craig noticed improvements in his health. That’s when he got serious about the business potential of ASEA.
In November 2009, he and a group of his colleagues flew in and met with ASEA Founders Verdis, Jim, and Gary. And although Craig’s initial draw to ASEA was based on his experience with the product, his decision to become a business builder was rock solid after meeting with the Founders. “They shared their vision with us and I knew that I had the chance to get in at the starting gates with this company. This meant there would be growing pains, but it’s also the most rewarding time,” he adds.
Craig returned to Hawaii and began sharing ASEA with others. “The great thing about living in Hawaii is that we’re a tight community and everyone here has connections to friends and family on the mainland or other parts of the world,” he says. Those connections are strong and helped Craig to reach out to his own community and beyond. In February 2010, Craig and his team opened an ASEA training center in Hilo for their weekly meetings. He says, “We also got involved locally by having booths at concerts and fairs and participating in the walks for cancer awareness.”
As Craig focused his efforts and time on helping others with their health and new ASEA businesses, he noticed something—his own life was transforming. The changes for good in Craig’s life have created a ripple effect throughout his entire family, and for that reason, he affectionately calls ASEA hope in a bottle. “Life before ASEA wasn’t too good. Now my life has completely changed—there’s no way to explain it. I have total time freedom, I met a good woman, I have good relationships with my family members, and many of them are in the business now.”
When Craig’s Dad was sick, he was able to go home and spend six weeks with him before he passed away, all while his ASEA business continued to grow. “There’s no way I could have ever been able to do that when I was building homes. I’m just so grateful!” Craig adds, “I’ve always wanted to be a part of something where I could make a difference, and now I can with ASEA. I never had that opportunity with real estate. You sell a house, you help one family. You help people with ASEA, you help a community. It makes a big difference!”
ASEA’s business model of helping others is an environment in which Craig thrives, and he is thankful for the mentoring he received from his upline leader, Paul Taira. “Paul has traveled with me to help me build my business and he has taught me a lot about network marketing and health. I’ve gone from drinking too much and eating poorly to now being conscious about my habits and I’ve lost 50 pounds!” Craig also appreciates the training and focus on personal development that ASEA has provided him. “Reading the book, The Anatomy of Peace, was a big deal for me because it allowed me to negotiate my way out of a partnership of 20 years and get to where I am now. I’ve discovered that life is a lot of fun if you don’t make yourself miserable and don’t get in your own way.”
Now Craig’s ambition is to help others to experience the freedom and happiness that comes from increased health, wellness, and a solid income stream from ASEA. He and ASEA leader Merle Lam are working with a local preacher to help single moms build a successful income. “We have set up a training center and a store at the church so when the women bring their children in for preschool, they have the opportunity to be trained and work in the store sharing ASEA with others.” He continues, “With this product and technology, I can teach my team that they can reach people all over the world.”
For Craig, telling others about ASEA can be summed up in three words—drink, care, share. “If you drink ASEA and care about people, then you’ll start sharing it with them. If you don’t drink it, then you have nothing to begin with. Everyone can recommend their favorite restaurant; this is the same thing.” Craig also tells his team members, “Don’t ever quit! We were at a concert the other night and we saw people who were 10 feet away from enjoying a free concert because they got tired and stopped walking. It’s the same with this business—people quit too soon, oftentimes when they’re only one or two people away from complete freedom.”
With ASEA, this Double Diamond Executive is finally able to build something he is excited about putting his whole heart into—a future of helping others build a solid foundation with ASEA. “My outlook has never been better,” he exclaims. “I have experienced more happiness, freedom, and personal growth in these last three years than I ever imagined. ASEA has transformed my life, and to see how ASEA is transforming the lives of others is a really emotionally rewarding thing. It’s a great celebration!”

AFG's Craig Lindner: Insurance reimbursements for mental health care 'shocking'

Craig Lindner

Craig Lindner, co-CEO of American Financial Group Inc., a Cincinnati-based insurance company, said today that it was shocking and illogical that reimbursements from most major insurance carriers and the federal government don't come close to covering the cost of treating people with mental illness.
Lindner, the founder and chairman of the board of UC Health's Lindner Center of Hope, a nonprofit mental health hospital in Mason, said the economic impact of mental illness is staggering.

He added that Cincinnati might have trouble attracting the best doctors possible if insurance reimbursements remain low not just for treating mental illness but also cancer and heart disease.
Cincinnati-based American Financial Group specializes in property and casualty insurance as well as annuities, not health insurance.
"As the co-CEO of a major company, I am well aware of the need to control health care costs," Lindner said. "But there is a fine line beyond which we are not taking appropriate responsibility for our employees' health. I am hopeful that our business leaders understand where that line is."
Lindner addressed the topic while giving the keynote speech during this year's Duffey Conway Ethical Leadership Series breakfast at the Westin hotel downtown, which was sponsored by Mount St. Joseph University.
The Lindner Center, which opened in 2008 and is the 23rd largest hospital in the Tri-State, draws patients from throughout the country and around the world. It recently kicked off a $15 million capital campaign to expand programs and services.
"The business side of a mental health hospital has been shocking to me," Lindner told the audience of about 200 people.
"Reimbursements from most major carriers and the federal government do not come close to covering the real cost of treatment," Lindner said. "There is no relationship between demand for services and reimbursement rates. The quality of care does not impact reimbursement rates. As a businessman, none of this is logical to me."
Lindner said Cincinnati has excellent medical care available but lags behind much of the rest of the nation is reimbursement rates.

"In Cincinnati, mental health care reimbursements are in the bottom 10 percent in the nation," Lindner said. "And it is my understanding that reimbursements for many other medical services … such as care for heart disease, cancer, et cetera, are in the bottom 30 percent.
"If that continues, I believe it will be difficult long term to attract the top doctors and to have facilities that are competitive with other cities that have much stronger reimbursements," he said.




 


In May, the Lindner Center of Hope completed a $3.5 million addition, which opened up space to begin a short-term residential program to diagnose and treat children with mental health and addiction issues. The center, which partners with Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, offers a similar program for adults.
Low reimbursements "make it very challenging to provide quality care and have a sustainable business model," Lindner said. "I now understand why mental health care is so deficient in this country."
He called psychiatric disorders the nation's No. 1 public health problem, affecting an estimated 26 percent of Americans 18 or older. Depression alone affects 15 million Americans.
"The economic impact of mental illness in terms of direct and indirect costs in lost productivity is staggering," Lindner said. "Mental illness is highly treatable, but under-treated. (That's) principally due to stigma and the lack of access to quality mental health services."
The goal of the Lindner Center of Hope is to address the unmet need in Greater Cincinnati, he said.
"I believe that excellent health care is vital to a strong community and an important consideration when people are deciding where they want to live, or when companies decide where to locate," Lindner said.
After his speech, Lindner told me that business leaders should work with politicians to try to rectify the problem of low reimbursements.
While acknowledging that most members of Congress appear disinclined to spend more on health care, Lindner said: "The cost of not giving proper care and treatment is far higher than giving a good quality of care."

The Family of Carl H. Lindner Jr. and American Financial Group Give $11M for New UC Lindner College of Business Building
Transformative Gift is Largest Ever for the Lindner College of Business
CINCINNATI - October 5, 2016 – The University of Cincinnati Carl H. Lindner College of Business has received the largest gift in its 110-year history from the family of the late Carl H. Lindner Jr., the college’s namesake, and Cincinnati-based holding firm American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG). The transformative $11 million gift will help create a new 225,000-square-foot building for the Lindner College of Business, which is expected to be completed by fall 2019.
The Lindner family, including Edyth Lindner, wife of the late Carl H. Lindner Jr., Carl III and Martha Lindner, S. Craig and Frances Lindner, and Keith and Courtney Lindner, generously contributed $6 million to the project and is considering naming opportunities around the new building and complex. AFG made the largest gift ever in its history, giving $5 million to the new building project. The Lindners hope the gift will inspire others to give back to the college while honoring the legacy of their beloved father and husband, Carl H. Lindner Jr.
“My family gives this gift out of love for our father, Carl H. Lindner Jr., the trajectory of the University of Cincinnati, and our longstanding relationship with UC.” said Carl H. Lindner III, Co-CEO of AFG, BBA ‘75.
“We are excited about the tremendous success of the Carl H. Lindner Jr. College of Business and are proud to support fundraising efforts for the innovative new building that continues our father’s legacy,” said S. Craig Lindner, Co-CEO of AFG, BBA ’77.
In early August, the university released preliminary renderings of the new building for the Lindner College of Business, designed by internationally renowned Henning Larsen Architects with Cincinnati-based KZF Design as the architect of record. Early designs feature a four-story building with glass facades, a grand atrium and lobby, open workspaces, a courtyard, a large café, lecture spaces, a teaching lab and more.
“Carl H. Lindner Jr. and his family have been instrumental in positioning our business school as one of the best in the nation, and with this transformational gift, they are ensuring our rise to preeminence with a best-in-class campus to educate the world’s next business leaders for generations to come,” said David Szymanski, dean of the Lindner College of Business. “Our   innovative and inspirational facility will be leading edge and will meaningfully advance the college and the university by creating new learning possibilities and solution-driven outcomes for students, faculty, alumni, and corporate and community partners. We are grateful for the Lindner family’s leadership support and look forward to continuing the extraordinary legacy of our college’s namesake.”
The new Lindner College of Business building is expected to cost about $120 million and will occupy the current site of the Russell C. Myers Alumni Center and Faculty Club building. Temporary and permanent locations are being considered for the Alumni Association.
“The Lindner family has made an unparalleled impact on the University of Cincinnati,” said UC Interim President Beverly J. Davenport. “From Carl H. Lindner Jr.’s visionary support of the Lindner College of Business to the family’s founding of the Lindner Center of HOPE to their game-changing contributions to Bearcats athletics, UC is truly grateful for our prized partnership with the Lindner family. The new home for our Lindner College of Business will be an exemplar of how 21st century learning spaces can transform the educational experience for our students and symbolize the rise to international prominence of both the University of Cincinnati and the Lindner College of Business. It is destined to become a global model for premier business schools focused on student-centered learning, innovation, collaboration and interaction with industry experts.”
Fundraising for the new building has been underway since August 2015, and more than $20 million has been raised for the project. The current building, located at 2925 Campus Green Drive, is nearly three decades old and unable to accommodate the college’s rapid growth. Enrollment in undergraduate and graduate business degrees have both increased, up 50 percent and 200 percent, respectively, since 2010. More than one third of business classes are now taught outside Lindner Hall.
“With this incredibly generous gift, the Lindner Family and AFG have issued a rallying cry for UC’s other partners to invest in the new building project for the Lindner College of Business,” said UC Foundation President Rodney Grabowski. “The new facility will benefit the university and city for decades to come, serving as a central hub for the intersection of business education and practice.”
In recent years, the Lindner College of Business has received numerous national accolades and is on a path toward preeminence. Its MBA program has earned the biggest three-year rankings jump in the country in U.S. News & World Report and the Lindner MBA was recently ranked the No. 1 best value MBA program in the United States by CollegeAtlas.org. Several of its undergraduates programs also are nationally ranked, including its marketing program, which Bloomberg Businessweek recently ranked No. 5 in the nation among public universities. The new building will help propel this growth and spur further national and international recognition.

His vision was to attract the best and brightest students to Greater Cincinnati by offering a first-class education. He was once-quoted saying, “My dream is to put UC’s business college on the map as one of the finest in the nation.”
Today, Carl H. Lindner Jr.’s legacy is carried on by his wife, Edyth, and three sons, Carl III, BBA ’75, Craig, BBA ’77, and Keith. The Lindner Center of HOPE, Richard E.

Chiquita Brands International is a company in the agri-food sector, resulting in 1989, a mere change of name of company United Fruit Company. The name change follows the desire to give a new image to the brand in order to reassure investors and consumers following a series of scandals related to corruption, human exploitation and trafficking of influence. In 2008, she still has interests in the following countries in Latin America: Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama.
History
In 1990, Chiquita Brands International is the largest banana company in the world, with 33% of the global market against 22% for Dole. It takes a spot that was previously [1].
In early 1995, she joins forces with the Rainforest Alliance, an international nongovernmental organization dedicated to protecting tropical forests, to improve safety and environmental practices on the plantations of the company. In 1997, 104 km2 of the company are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, meaning that they meet the requirements of environmental and social NGOs.
In 2001, Chiquita Brands International declares bankruptcy. Since 2002, a recovery attempt, she adopts a new code of conduct following the minimum standard required by the Social Accountability International on human rights and labor rights. After meeting with members of the International Federation of Labour (International Labor Federation) and COLSIBA, a union of banana workers in Latin America, the company accepts an enhancement of working conditions of employees.

Penn Central Transportation Company

The history of the status of the company [edit]
Pennsylvania New York Central Transportation Company was founded on 1 February 1968 following the takeover of the New York Central Railroad by the Pennsylvania Railroad. The name of Penn Central was filed, and May 8, the company was officially renamed the Penn Central Company. Penn Central Transportation Company was registered on 1 April 1969, and its shares were transferred to the new Penn Central Holding Company. On 1 October, the Penn Central Transportation Company was merged into Penn Central Company. The next day, the Penn Central Company was renamed the Penn Central Transportation Company, and Penn Central Holding Company became the Penn Central Company. The former Pennsylvania Company, a holding company created in 1870 and reconstructed in 1958, continued to exist despite the mergers. While the Penn Central Transportation Company was merged into Conrail in 1976, the holding company Penn Central Company continued to exist as a standalone company. In the years 1970 and 1980, the new Penn Central was a conglomerate made up largely by various companies acquired by the former Penn Central before the bankruptcy. When Conrail was created in 1976, The Penn Central Holding Company owned the Madison Square Garden (located above Penn Station), and its major tenants: the baseball team New York Knickerbockers and the hockey team of New York Rangers. The new Penn Central, which still possessed rights of way and stations, decided to liquidate its assets to strengthen one of its subsidiaries in insurance. 

  -> It's for Frances Lindner  

  The former Penn Central Corporation changed its name to American Premier Underwriters in March 1994. He joined the financial empire of Carl Lindner and his American Financial Group located in Cincinnati. On December 6, 2006, the United States Department of Transportation approved the transfer of 251 km of track, consisting of the Harlem-Hudson Line and those of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, Midtown TDR Ventures Financial Group LLC [ 1]. Although the subsidiaries of American Financial Group (AFG), have left the railway for many years, AFG is still owner in 2006 from Grand Central Terminal. The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority is currently the tenant of this station. It is stated that the MTA will be renegotiated lease Feb. 28, 2274. The New York Post dated July 6, 2007, reported that the group Midtown TDR was now controlled by Penson and Venture. The New York Post noted that the MTA should pay $ 2.24 million lease in 2007, would have first option on the station and its tracks in 2017, which would be proposed again 15 years later in 2032 [2]. The profitability of the station is limited. Destruction for a new development is currently impossible, since a law of conservation of historical monuments protects.
