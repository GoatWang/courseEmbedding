This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Resolution Performance Products LLC Announces the Election of David S. Graziosi as C.F.O.



Published on 2004-04-20. Author :
SpecialChem











 

HOUSTON -- Resolution Performance Products LLC, the leading
producer of epoxy resins and Versatic acids announced on 19th April, the
election of David S. Graziosi as Chief Financial Officer and Executive
Vice President, effective May 10, 2004. Mr. Graziosi is currently Vice
President and CFO of General Chemical Industrial Products Inc. He will
be replacing J. Travis Spoede who will be leaving the Company at the end
of May. It is anticipated that Mr. Spoede will be providing consulting
services to the Company on potential growth projects.
 "We appreciate the many contributions that Travis
Spoede has made during the formation and initial operations of Resolution,"
said Marvin O. Schlanger, CEO and Chairman. Schlanger added, "We
are very excited about having someone of the experience and caliber of
Dave Graziosi join RPP's executive management team as we move forward
into the future."
Resolution Performance Products (RPP) is the leading
worldwide manufacturer and developer of epoxy resins and is also the leading
global manufacturer of Versatic acids and derivatives. Epoxy resins are
chemicals primarily used in the manufacture of coatings, adhesives, printed
circuit boards, fiber reinforced plastics and construction materials.
The Company, with approximately 900 employees, has operations in the United
States, Europe and Asia. Additional information about the Company and
its financial results for annual, quarterly and current report filings
are available on its web site at www.resins.com under the corporate information
heading.
Certain statements in this press release may contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These statements are based on RPP's current expectations
and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause RPP's actual results
to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. The Company
can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct.
Factors that could cause the Company's results to differ materially from
current expectations include: general economic and business conditions,
industry trends, raw material costs and availability, changes in demand
for its products, actions of its competitors, substantial indebtedness
and the additional factors and risks contained in the Company's Registration
Statement on Form S-4 declared effective on February 4, 2004 (File No.
333-112016) and in its periodic reports filed with the SEC.

Top Honoree, Private Companies (revenue over $100 million)

	
	The genesis of Allison Transmission sounds like a recipe for disaster. Spun off from General Motors in August of 2007, it became an independent entity just in time for the start of the worst recession in decades.

	That perfect storm could have spelled disaster for its 2,900 employees, 1,550 worldwide distributors, and global facilities scattered everywhere from China to Brazil to India. The fact that it didn’t roll over is largely due to the Herculean efforts of executive vice president and CFO David Graziosi.



	“Under Graziosi’s leadership as CFO, Allison Transmission has successfully separated from GM, transformed its business operations, increased its market share, seen its revenue increase, created a financial infrastructure to support a $2 billion-sales-per-year multinational corporation and grown a commercial vehicle-related business during the worst economic climate since the Great Depression,” said Allison exec Melissa Sauer.

Graziosi assumed his position in November of 2007, three months after GM sold the company to the Carlyle Group and Onyx Corp. He faced a monstrous “to-do” list, including building a stand-alone financial organization, plus establishing myriad processes and infrastructure from scratch. For example, even though Allison employed thousands worldwide, it lacked a payroll department. Graziosi and his team took care of that little omission, and tackled others as well. Among a great many other things, he put together or oversaw the implementation of a treasury function and a tax department; repatriation of the accounts receivable and accounts payable processes; and creation of a financial reporting function, including debt/investor relations, where none had existed prior to 2007.

	By establishing strong financial and accounting processes, Graziosi and his team proactively identified operating and financial problems far in advance, enabling management to address them in an orderly manner.

	He got things shipshape just in time for an economic tsunami. But when the Great Recession hit, something unusual—perhaps even unprecedented—happened. The downturn left many automotive companies grinding metal. Yet Allison not only survived during the past three years, it expanded. Stronger today than when it entered the downturn, the company continues to meet or exceed its debt obligations, and it’s actually improved its credit ratings outlook. This was accomplished by, to put it simply, hoping for the best but planning for the worst.

	“The cost reduction and containment decisions made by Allison in late 2008 and early 2009 assumed conditions would be more challenging than external forecasts indicated,” Graziosi said. “Allison maintained high levels of operating flexibility to ensure customer requirements could be met and its brand promise fulfilled while remaining committed to the company’s long term investment/return objectives. The key is that you should plan for worse conditions and maintain the flexibility to execute for better conditions.”

	His technical skills, strategic planning and critical thinking helped position Allison as a premier manufacturer of hybrid propulsion systems and commercial-duty, fully automatic transmissions for civil and military applications. While retooling the product line, Graziosi and his team also retooled operations to properly support a $2 billion-a-year multinational company. That focus on streamlining internal practices and corporate policies proved critical to survival. For instance, much of the company’s business is tied to the medium-duty truck market in the NAFTA area—not exactly the firmest of markets.

	“Given this situation Allison is required to maintain high levels of operating flexibility with financial discipline and commitment to its long term investment and return objectives,” Graziosi said. “Despite these challenges Allison’s employees and management have worked diligently to support its customers and prudently control the capital structure.”

	In other words, hoping for the best but planning for the worst.•
