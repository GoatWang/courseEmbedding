It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

                    Port Charlotte, Florida is situated around one of my favorite places,  Charlotte Harbor, Florida's second-largest estuary system. The  unspoiled beauty and its livability, making it a destination of choice for both full-time residents and vacationers is what Port Charlotte/Charlotte County Florida is all about.

In spite of a growth explosion in recent years, Charlotte County has remained a delightful place to live, work and vacation.

The Greater Port Charlotte area has so much to offer from schooling, art, symphonies, fishing, golfing, boating, major league baseball spring training, and much, much more.   The area just provides a beautiful environment to live in.   There is something for everyone

One of the biggest plus of living in Florida is our unique wildlife.  If you love nature, which includes alligators, coyotes, foxes, panthers, bobcats, bears, great blue heron, dolphins (those beautiful creatures that they are), then look no further.  This is the place for you.
