Mutual Funds

















BMO Mutual Funds offers a comprehensive line-up of investment solutions to help you meet your savings and investment needs, whether you are looking for income or growth, or saving for a specific goal such as Retirement or Education.

What is a mutual fund?

A mutual fund is a pool of investments managed by a professional portfolio manager.  The portfolio manager invests the money on behalf of a group of investors who have similar investment goals.  Depending on the fund’s investment objective, a mutual fund can invest in stocks, bonds, cash, or other mutual funds or exchange traded funds.

Mutual Funds provide many benefits, including:


Professional money management
Diversification
Broad investment options across sectors, asset classes and geographies
Easy to buy and available with low minimum initial investment amounts

Mutual Fund Essentials





When it comes to investing, knowledge is power. Take the time to familiarize yourself with mutual fund basics and the wide selection of available funds before making investment decisions.













What is a Mutual Fund?



A mutual fund is an investment that pools your money with that of other investors to purchase a portfolio of individual investments. The mutual fund units you buy represent your share of the fund's investment portfolio.

Each fund is managed according to its investment objectives. Mutual funds offer many advantages, including:


Ease of investing
Professional management by investment experts
A wide selection of investments to meet all your needs
Diversification potential to maximize return potential and manage risk
The ability to buy and sell most funds on any business day











Your investment options



BMO offers a full range of fund choices whether you want to:


Invest in just one fund
Put together a diversified portfolio of individual funds
Make a one-stop investment in one of our Managed Programs to get a mix of funds tailored to your investment goals and risk tolerance


Use our Mutual Funds List to research the wide range of BMO fund possibilities so the investments you choose reflect your objectives.










How to choose Mutual Funds




Understand your investment goals. Our Investor Profiler can help you assess your needs and help you determine your level of risk
Carefully research fund possibilities
 Know the investment and taxation basics of Mutual Funds
Contact a BMO investment professional to help you select investments that fit with your plan.












Mutual Funds and Risk



When it comes to investing, risk is a fact of life. But risk can be managed. You can choose low-risk, "conservative" income-oriented investments or take on more risk through growth investments that offer higher return potential.

Think about how to balance your goals with the degree of risk you're comfortable with.

Our Investor Profiler can help you assess your needs and help you determine your level of risk.










How distributions work



There's more to mutual funds returns than unit prices. Funds also make cash distributions that enhance returns. These can be automatically reinvested in additional fund units or received as cash payments.

Depending on the type of fund, distributions may be made monthly, quarterly or yearly.










Mutual Fund Fees



We’re committed to bringing clarity around Mutual Fund fees, so that you can make smart decisions about your investments. Watch our 3 minute video



            We're sorry, but your device does not support this video player. 




 


















 about mutual fund fees, or read our Frequently Asked Questions and handy fact sheet to learn more.  
          










Taxes and your funds



Take the time to understand how taxes affect your investments. Taxes determine how much goes into your pocket after the government takes its share of investment profits. Consider these essential tax facts.


You could be liable for capital gains income taxes when you realize a profit on fund units
Fund distributions are taxable. How much tax you pay will depend on the type of fund distribution and your marginal tax rate
Investment growth is sheltered from tax inside a registered investment such as an RSP, RIF, RESP or TFSA

What are BMO ETF portfolios
 
 


ETF portfolios are an all-in-one solution that allow investors to target a specific risk level based on their investment goals. ETF portfolios combine several individual ETFs to build a well-diversified portfolio in a single mutual fund, where professional money managers strategically allocate money across various investment solutions.


BMO ETF Portfolios are comprised of award-winning BMO ETFs managed by our world class investment team. The investment team combines active fund management with passive ETF solutions to create innovative portfolios.

Use our ETF Portfolio Selector to find the right mix of equity and fixed income based on your client’s investment horizon.

Full market cycle performance
 
BMO ETF Portfolios are core investments that deliver returns based on your risk profile. BMO Global Asset Management uses leading edge proprietary techniques to carefully manage the risk of each ETF portfolio to offer participation when markets are moving higher and downside protection when markets are in decline.
 
 




 
 


Save on fees
 
In the example below, a client invested in Portfolio A pays 0.5% less per year in management fees than the client invested in Portfolio B. On an initial $100,000 investment that grows at 6% annually for 30 years, the client invested in portfolio A saves more than $75,000.
 
 


*Assumptions:




Two portfolios with an initial investment of $100,000 each
Portfolios are held for 30 years




Annual rate of return is 6% with no distributions
Portfolio A pays 0.5% less in fees each year

† Wealth management products and services may be offered by Bank of Montreal or by one or more of its affiliates.
* Some conditions apply.
**The $1.00 service fee that may have applied when you use Interac e-Transfer has been eliminated for customers with an Everyday Bank Plan. The monthly Plan fee may still apply.

1 Terms and conditions apply.
2 BMO Growth GICs are issued by Bank of Montreal Mortgage Corporation and guaranteed by Bank of Montreal. The principal amount of a BMO Growth GIC is guaranteed and is repayable upon maturity, but there is no guarantee of earning any return linked to the performance of the underlying securities. The rate of return for the term payable, if any, will be the return on the portfolio of investments which are the basis for calculating the return on the BMO Growth GIC (the “Reference Portfolio”) subject to the following: the rate of return for the term will not be less than zero or more than the maximum rate of return for the four-year term, which for the BMO Growth GIC series 115 is 16%. The return on the Reference Portfolio, if any, is determined without reference to any dividends or distributions paid on the securities and is the simple average of the percentage changes in the value of each underlying security in the Reference Portfolio over the term of the BMO Growth GIC. The rate of return for the term: (i) is not compounded; (ii) as set out in this advertisement is based on the BMO Growth GIC series 115 and the maximum rate of return for the term is subject to change between series; and (iii) is not an annual rate but is the rate of return over the entire term of the BMO Growth GIC. If market disruptions or other special circumstances affect the calculation of the return, the calculation agent may adjust or delay the calculation or payment of interest, estimate the value of an underlying security, replace a security and/or determine the amount of interest, if any, that may be payable in an alternate manner. The terms and conditions for BMO Growth GICs are available at your local BMO Bank of Montreal branch.
¶ Annualized return for BMO SelectTrust® Balanced Portfolio Series A: since inception 7.65%; 1-year 4.6%; 3-year 7.61%. Series A as at October 12th, 2016. Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the fund facts or prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compounded total returns including changes in unit value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemptions, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any unit holder that would have reduced returns. BMO Mutual Funds are offered by BMO Investments Inc., a financial services firm and separate entity from Bank of Montreal. Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
