Risk Disclosure: Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund invests in small and medium size companies, which carry greater risk than is customarily associated with larger, more established companies. With non-diversification risk, the Fund will typically invest in securities of fewer issuers, which exposes the Fund to greater market risk. Investing in ADRs (American Depository Receipt) carries risks of political and financial instability, less liquidity and greater volatility, as well as risks associated with the lack of reliable accounting and financial information. The Fund is also subject to other risks, such as REIT risk with possible real estate market declines, which are detailed in the Fund’s prospectus.

Each account can be customized and is managed separately in accordance with client objectives. We focus all of our energy on finding great companies for our clients to own over an extended period of time. We believe that wealth is created by long-term investments in successful and well-managed companies. We place great emphasis on quality of management and spend significant time getting to know and understand the people who run these businesses.
How We Add Value
•
Our Research – Perform independent, focused research to find undiscovered companies,
investigate them diligently, and avoid poorly managed companies.

Our Patience – Focus on the long-term investment horizon allowing the company to
manage the business, not the stock.

outperformance. Outsized positions prove our conviction in our names. Great team
communication allows for nimble portfolio management.

 Be sure you put

 — Abraham Lincoln  

 


 


Philosophy
 





Over time, we believe stock performance is highly correlated with growth in earnings. We are long-term investors in financially strong, well-managed companies with sustainable growth prospects. We are all cap growth managers who believe that the individual characteristics of a business are far more important than its size. We prefer to operate across the full market capitalization spectrum and invest in companies that are market leaders of an industry niche. Within these companies, we look for world-class management teams with superior execution skills who deliver on a consistent basis in varied environments. We prefer managements that do not draw large salaries but rather have meaningful equity positions in their companies.
By adhering to our disciplines of primary research, objective valuation analysis and patience, we have been able to achieve superior and consistent returns in managed portfolios. We firmly believe that the constant application of these disciplines protects our portfolios from the temptation of buying into investment fads and “popular” stocks.
Our objective is to provide our clients with long-term growth of their capital as owners of successful well-managed enterprises. To this end and in an effort to preserve capital, the DF Dent Equity Composite has experienced only four negative return years over the last 40 years versus seven negative return years for the S&P 500 Index. In three of those four down years, the DF Dent Equity Composite outperformed the S&P 500 Index. We structure portfolios to reduce exposure to a disappointing year resulting from any one market sector or mistakes in individual security selection. By sticking to our knitting and not getting caught up in short-term investment fads, our investments have demonstrated significant excess returns in both up and down markets.

What are analysts saying about Watsco stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Watsco stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Watsco expects to generate earnings growth and anticipates cash flow to exceed net income in 2017. The company’s strategic goals will help to further strengthen its leadership position, accelerate sales growth and extend reach to new geographies and sales channels. The company will benefit from the expansion of product offerings and growth potential in the replacement market. Improved selling margins and richer sales mix of higher-efficiency systems will also drive growth. Watsco's Carrier Enterprise business unit has recently acquired 35% ownership of Russell Sigler, Inc, a move that will strengthen its presence in the significant Western U.S. markets." (6/27/2017)
2. Stifel Nicolaus analysts commented, "Headline miss a tad surprising given strong 4Q results for most HVAC names, with other HVAC products negative. High expectation stock, as reflected in the underperformance today (down ~4% vs. +40 bps for the S&P 500). That said, we don't think underperformance will last for long. Under the hood, decent performance on GM and continued investment and return on technology investments. Waving in more of the Carrier JV is common sense to us. Given the increased income (net the increased interest expense) as a result of the Carrier JV (we are dialing ~$0.15 benefit for 2017E). We take our 2017E EPS estimate to $5.85 (from $5.70) and our 2018E EPS remains at $6.60, which could readily have upside due to Trump tax benefits or incremental M&A, for which management was quite bullish on the prospects. We are also introducing 2017 quarterly estimates. Reiterate Buy, $175 target price based on 26.5x our 2018E EPS of $6.60." (2/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Watsco (NYSE:WSO) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 2 Hold Ratings, 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.33)Consensus Price Target: $161.75 (7.51% upside)

What are analysts saying about Wayfair stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Wayfair stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Wayfair Inc. engages in the e-commerce business. It offers bedroom, living room, kitchen and dining, home entertainment, home office, game room and bar, patio, hallway and entryway, and bathroom furniture. The Company operates under the Wayfair.com, Joss & Main, AllModern, DwellStudio, and Birch Lane brands. It offers products and services primarily in the United States. Wayfair LLC is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.   " (5/16/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "The company is expected to report 1Q17 earnings on Tuesday, May 9, 2017, pre-market open and host a call with investors at 8am ET." (5/2/2017)
3. Piper Jaffray Companies analysts commented, "We are reiterating our OW rating and $51 price target following the conclusion of our Spring 2017 Piper Jaffray Women's Survey. Our survey includes responses from 1,050 women and is divided up into upper income (>$80k) and average income ($35k-$80k) responses. Importantly, results show a continued rise in Wayfair brand ranking, brand awareness, respondent purchases from Wayfair, and respondents' intent to purchase from Wayfair in the next 6 months. Survey results also show generally favorable intentions for overall home remodeling and redecorating activity. We are more confident in Wayfair's sales outlook for 2017 based on these results, stepped up advertising in the U.S. this year, and what we believe has been a recent improvement in sales trends from tax refund activity." (3/21/2017)
4. Wedbush analysts commented, "We forecast W to hit $1b in quarterly revenue for the first time in 4Q16, to be reported on February 23 BMO, outpacing guidance and consensus expectations. We also see upside for EBITDA margin, driven mainly by revenue upside. We would not be surprised if 1Q17 guidance comes up a bit short of consensus on revenue and EBITDA margin, but believe investors are braced for this conservatism that the company has demonstrated for the last two quarters. This data, combined with guidance to run-rate profitability later this year and a planned break-out near-term of U.S. results as intimated at ICR, should support W shares and leads us to raise our target price on W from $40 to $45. Slowing advertising leverage (particularly in light of new moves by Amazon in Google product listing ads) and declining orders per average customer are focal points to monitor." (2/15/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Wayfair (NYSE:W) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.50)Consensus Price Target: $63.32 (17.82% downside)
