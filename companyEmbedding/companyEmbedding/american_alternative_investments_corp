Alternative Investment Funds
We bring years of experience as a private equity investor.  This  alternative form of investing offers institutions ownership in a company with  equity securities not publicly available.
The term “private equity” is generally used to describe  investments in companies through private transactions in return for ownership  interests in those companies. While those companies may have some publicly  traded securities, private equity investors generally purchase non-publicly  traded securities.
Private equity investing benefits companies and individuals  by providing an additional or an alternative source of capital to the public  equity and debt markets. This capital may be used for a number of different  purposes, including financing product development or additional manufacturing  capacity, funding a joint venture, restructuring a company's operations or  balance sheet, or financing acquisitions.
American Private Equity Management (APEM) manages more than $230 million in a family of private equity funds of funds. The APEM platform consists of a series of three funds of funds vehicles that invest capital primarily in the middle market leveraged buyout space, with added exposure to other strategies (i.e., oil & gas and distressed debt). APEM engages American Beacon Advisors, Inc., a registered investment adviser, to provide management and administrative services to the funds of funds, and to source, evaluate, select and monitor underlying private equity funds.    
Please contact Mac Owens at 1.800.967.9009 x6224 to learn more about these investment opportunities.

Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

                Mutual funds and ETFs have evolved to offer alternative
investment opportunities to nearly every investor.
            









Alternatives Use Familiar Investments and Apply Differentiated Strategies





Alternative strategies generally use traditional investments, like stocks and bonds, and apply non-traditional investment approaches in an effort to provide differentiated returns. Alternative strategies can also access other asset classes, such as real estate or commodities.










Alternatives Are Now More Accessible





For many years, alternative investments were only available to institutions, like pensions and endowments, and certain individual investors. Today, nearly every investor can access the differentiated return characteristics of alternatives through mutual funds or ETFs, also known as liquid alternatives.

Views and opinions expressed are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a recommendation by GSAM to buy, sell, or hold any security. An investment in alternatives is not appropriate for all investors. Please see additional disclosures. Note that alternative investing is not suitable for all investors and liquid alternatives are not riskless investments, so investors can lose money.

Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set















Alternatives: Exploring a Broader Opportunity Set

 / 






















Broader Adoption of Alternatives Is Underway





Liquid alternatives industry assets and the number of available funds have grown tremendously as these strategies have become increasingly available in mutual fund format.










Source: Morningstar as of December 31, 2016. For illustrative purposes only. In an effort to distinguish funds by what they own, as well as by their prospectus objectives and styles, Morningstar developed the Morningstar Categories. While the prospectus objective identifies a fund's investment goals based on the wording in the fund prospectus, the Morningstar Category identifies funds based on their actual investment styles as measured by their underlying portfolio holdings (portfolio and other statistics over the past three years).







Taking an Alternate Path to Generate Returns

                Alternatives may help investors achieve a smoother investment experience over various market cycles, allowing for long-term outperformance.
            









Alternatives Have Often Outperformed Either Stocks or Bonds





A more flexible investment approach allows alternative strategies to access distinct drivers of return. As a result, they may behave more independently than traditional asset classes. Alternatives have historically provided differentiated returns and helped to stabilize investment portfolios over time.





Over the Past 27 Years, Alternatives Outperformed at Least One Element of an Investor’s Core Portfolio 67% of the Time.










Additional Returns









For Illustrative Purposes Only. Source: Bloomberg, GSAM. Underlying Indices: Core Equity – S&P 500 Index; Core Fixed Income – Barclays US Agg Bond Index; Alternatives – HFRIFOF Index. Please see additional disclosures. Time period shown is earliest common inception date (HFRI FoF inception 1/1/1990) through the most recent end of year. Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.











Alternatives Have Provided Additional Stability to Investors





Over the past 25 years, stocks have appreciated in value by a factor of ten, though the ascent has been rocky at times. Bonds have had more modest but stable appreciation. By diversifying sources of return and helping to provide stability in market downturns, alternatives may encourage investors to stay the course over various market cycles.

Diversification does not protect an investor from market risk and does not ensure a profit.










Solving a Return Conundrum

                After years of strong returns for stocks and bonds, the future may not resemble the past.
            









We Believe Now Is the Time to Diversify Your Portfolio with Alternatives





With stock prices and bond yields near record levels, we believe it is unlikely for current trends to continue. Alternatives have historically delivered attractive returns relative to stocks and bonds during challenging market environments.

How It Works | BitcoinIRA.com


























































 
























 






 















How Bitcoin IRA Works














Bitcoin IRA is a one-of-a-kind investment opportunity.
 We are a full-service company that ensures a safe transfer of your retirement account into an IRS-approved account for Bitcoin and Ethereum.







  

















Step 1
Complete Your IRA Application



We will send you an application to set up a new Bitcoin IRA account with our custodian to get started.















  











Step 2
Rollover Your IRA or 401k Funds



Once your account is set up, we request a transfer of your funds from your existing retirement account into your new Bitcoin IRA.





















  

















Step 3
Buy Your Bitcoins



After your funds arrive we’ll schedule a phone call with you to perform a live trade and buy your Bitcoins.















  











Step 4
Access Your Exclusive Bitgo™ “Cold Storage” Wallet



Your Bitcoins are stored securely in our exclusive digital wallet with Bitgo, the leader in multi-signature encryption technology. 





















  
















We Ensure The Highest Security
We created a multi-layer system to provide maximum security for your Bitcoin IRA.















Your Digital Wallet
Your Bitcoins are stored with BitGo, the leader in multi-signature encryption and digital security with over $1 Billion in transactions per month. Learn more about Bitgo.




Your Security Keys
Three unique keys are generated to ensure maximum security. These are kept with:
✓ Your digital wallet, BitGo
✓ Your Bitcoin IRA custodian, Kingdom Trust
✓ Your backup key provider, Keytern.al




ID + Voice Verification
Unlike cash Bitcoin transactions, we require additional layers of security including ID verification and voice confirmation when we perform your live trade. This ensures maximum security for your transfer and purchase.














  









 
Multiple keys protects your Bitcoin IRA funds against single machine compromise or single key losses.
A multi-signature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. These private keys are spread across multiple machines, essentially eliminating the opportunity of theft from malware or hackers since they are unlikely to simultaneously compromise your laptop, desktop and smartphone.


















Getting started is easy. Let us help.




Take advantage of one of the fastest growing investments in 2017.
