Today’s health-care delivery system is facing numerous challenges: How do we deliver care effectively at a significantly lower cost while increasing access, improving outcomes and enhancing the patient experience? At OSU Center of Health Sciences, we believe that the only way to tackle these complex challenges is through innovation and technology.As Tulsa’s only academic health center and Oklahoma’s leader in the training of health-care providers for rural and underserved Oklahoma, we are exploring, developing, testing and implementing creative approaches to delivering quality care to Oklahomans no matter where they live. We are examining the efficiency of the traditional model of health-care delivery and asking, “Can we bring the care to the patient instead of having the patient come to the provider?” We see an enormous opportunity to unleash the power of technology to move the delivery of care much closer to the patient’s communities.Many of us in Tulsa take for granted the ease and convenience of accessing health care. We make an appointment, take time off work and then drive a short distance to our doctor’s office. Rural Oklahomans and underserved Tulsans have a vastly different experience accessing health care. They face reliable transportation hurdles and often experience financial setbacks in seeking medical treatment.Accessing health care is particularly challenging for rural Oklahomans. Many small towns do not have a primary care physician much less a specialist physician. Rural Oklahomans often have to travel long distances to receive any type of medical treatment, primary or specialty care. Imagine having to drive 25 to 50 miles to see a primary care physician and having to drive even farther to see a specialist. Imagine having to request an uncompensated sick day from your employer to see a doctor. The inconvenience and expense associated with accessing care may result in underserved Tulsans and rural Oklahomans delaying or foregoing care until the situation becomes dire and necessitates a costly visit to the emergency room or an exorbitant transport to an urban medical center.There is a real need for innovation in health-care delivery to address challenges with health-care access, quality and affordability for underserved Tulsans and rural Oklahomans. At OSU-CHS, we are committed to leveraging our intellectual capital, creative energy, statewide infrastructure and technological assets to bringing quality care to Oklahomans regardless of where they live. Through a partnership with Dr. Sanjeev Arora, founder and director of the ECHO Institute at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine, OSU-CHS has launched the OSU-CHS Project ECHO. OSU-CHS Project ECHO is proud to offer service lines in the areas of psychiatry, addiction medicine, obesity medicine, HIV/AIDS and women’s health.Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) is a collaborative medical education learning and capacity building model developed by Dr. Arora. The model uses interactive videoconferencing to link specialist teams with primary care providers in underserved areas. Through weekly videoconferences, primary care providers in underserved areas gain the specialty knowledge and experience to treat their patient’s conditions that used to require a specialist. Consequently, patients gain access to specialty care from a provider they trust at a lower cost without having to leave their community.
We look forward to the next step in this effort, the Rural Health Leadership Summit, to be held on the OSU-CHS campus and featuring Dr. Sanjeev Arora as the keynote speaker. By leveraging technologically enabled health-care delivery models such as Project ECHO, OSU-CHS will transform the delivery of health care for the greater good of our state and community.Kayse M. Shrum, D.O., is president of Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences and dean of the OSU College of Osteopathic Medicine. She also holds the Saint Francis Health System Endowed Chair in Pediatrics and the George Kaiser Family Foundation Chair in Medical Excellence.

It would have been more informative to reduce the public relations verbiage and instead include a "case in point" about an actual patient benefiting from the program.

Write a Readers Forum column
Op/ed space in the Tulsa World is limited. To preserve the space for the pieces we think our readers will most appreciate, we have these guidelines for submissions: 
1. Op/eds should to be about public policy issues not personalities.  
2. They should be debatable in nature: They should take a stance that some but not all of our readers would agree with.  
3. They should not be in direct response to previous op/ed columns, syndicated columns, letters to the editor or Tulsa World editorials. The proper forum for such responses is our letter to the editor space.  
4. They should come from authors who are authoritative on the topic or offer some unique identifiable perspective.  
5. They should to be about 600 words long.  
6. They cannot be election endorsements or un-endorsements, although at times the editorial department will solicit op/ed columns on both sides of an election for publication.  
7. They cannot be product endorsement.  
8. They should come from an author who lives within our circulation area.  
9. They should not have been published elsewhere or submitted for publication elsewhere.  
10. They cannot be libelous, incendiary or offensive to broad portions of our readership.  
11. They should to be accompanied with an electronic photo of the author for publication. 
These are not hard-and-fast rules. Sometimes, typically because of relative light demand for op/ed space, the editorial editor may waive one or more of the guidelines. At times of high demand, he may not be able to do so. 
Columns should be submitted to: wayne.greene@tulsaworld.com

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedDr. Shrum does not have any conditions listed.

In 2013, she was promoted to her current position as president of  OSU-CHS, becoming the youngest and first female president and dean of a medical  school in the state of Oklahoma. President Shrum holds the George  Kaiser Family Foundation Chair in Medical Excellence and Service and the Saint  Francis Health System Endowed Chair of Pediatrics.

Under her leadership, OSU Center for Health  Sciences has experienced unprecedented growth. Student enrollment has more than  doubled as new academic programs have been established to meet the workforce  needs of Oklahoma. To fuel the growth of OSU-CHS, President Shrum has raised  more than $22 million in private support, including an $8 million  transformative gift from the A.R. and Marylouise Tandy Foundation to support  the construction of a state-of-the -art clinical skills simulation building.  During her tenure, she has made addressing the healthcare workforce shortage in  rural Oklahoma a top priority for OSU-CHS. A fervent champion of rural health  and primary care medicine, President Shrum led the strategic efforts to create  a sustainable rural primary care physician pipeline program, which starts with  rural high school outreach programs and culminates with rural-based residency  training programs.  President Shrum launched  award-winning high school recruiting programs like Operation Orange and Blue  Coat to White Coat, established the Rural Medical Track (a rural-focused  medical curriculum), and  expanded the  number of residency training programs in Oklahoma by securing a $3.8 million grant from the  Oklahoma Tobacco Settlement Endowment Trust and a $5.6 million grant from the  Oklahoma Health Care Authority. 

President Shrum is active in a variety of  professional and charitable organizations. She currently serves on the Oklahoma  State Regents’ Task Force on the Future of Higher Education and holds  leadership positions in osteopathic professional organizations including Vice  President of the Oklahoma Osteopathic Association, Chair of the American  Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics, and committee positions on the American  Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine Board of Deans and the American  Osteopathic Association House of Delegates. She is also a board member of the  Children’s Hospital Foundation at Saint Francis, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of  Oklahoma, BankSNB and Southwest Bancorp, PLICO, Oklahoma State University  Medical Authority and Trust, and OSU Center for Health Systems Innovation.  President Shrum has been recognized for her leadership and many contributions  to improving health outcomes in Tulsa and Oklahoma. She was named a finalist  for the Journal Record’s 2015 Woman of Year award and was inducted into Connors  State College Athletic Hall of Fame in 2013. She also received the Oklahoma  Osteopathic Association’s Outstanding & Distinguished Service Award in 2014  and the Tulsa Mayor’s Commission on the Status of Women’s Pinnacle Award for  Health in 2012.
