Dorsal Capital Management Chooses Citi for Hedge Fund Administration Services
New York, NY - May 11, 2010 – Citigroup today announced that Citi® Investor Services, part of Citi's Global Transaction Services business, has been chosen by Dorsal Capital Management to provide a suite of administrative services for their hedge fund launched in Q4 of 2009.  The fund administration solutions Citi is providing include fund accounting and transfer agency. 
"We selected Citi because of its reputation as a premier service provider and its many excellent products and services," said Jeff Barnett, Chief Financial Officer, Dorsal Capital Management, whose investment partners were formerly portfolio managers at SAC Capital.  "We believe that having Citi as our fund administrator will offer value to our current investors and bolster our capital-raising efforts in the future."
"Dorsal Capital – with its SAC Capital heritage and management strength -- was a highly anticipated west coast hedge fund launch in 2009," said Neeraj Sahai, Global Head, Securities and Fund Services, Citi. "We are very pleased to be selected to provide these fund services, and we look forward to delivering superior administrative solutions to support the funds initial development and continued growth."
