Investment Guidance



Our fiduciary duty is to provide advice and guidance on appropriate and prudent solutions for a client’s financial life.  Our advisors take the time to develop a relationship of mutual trust and respect before any discussions of implementing solutions.  We recognize the importance of sound financial advice, and take our role in the process seriously as a guide for our clients.
We are solution professionals.  Recommendations are presented after careful portfolio diagnostics and thoughtful planning, and after examining the suggested implementation in light of current and relevant economic and stock market environments.  Our internal teams of strategists and analysts communicate continually with our advisors so that we remain current in our approach.
Designing a portfolio for a client based on fundamental principals, economic relevancy and unique goals and objectives  is a responsibility, a challenge and an honor – and we welcome opportunities to provide this guidance.









Insurance Guidance



People view their Investment Portfolio with great scrutiny.  We believe they should do the same with their Insurance Portfolio.
Our team of professionals will guide you in identifying, managing, and monitoring your Life, Long Term Care, and Disability Insurances.
We develop an unbiased, independent analysis of your current policies and Estate Plan.  This provides an objective overview of how you should realistically expect your policies to perform in the future.  If you determine an opportunity exists to improve your insurance portfolio, we will guide you through options and provide the information necessary to make informed decisions on an appropriate strategy.
We are not affiliated with any insurance company, so our interests are appropriately aligned with you throughout the process.









Financial Planning



You are unique in so many ways.  Shouldn’t your financial plan be as well?
Through a comprehensive planning process, we will guide you in identifying your objectives, organizing your resources, considering new financial strategies, optimizing the strategies to be most efficient, implementing your action plan, and monitoring your results as your world continues to change.
Your financial plan is designed to provide the resources you need, when you need them, to guide you in making important decisions that affect your financial future.
Life is an adventure, and adventures are better navigated with a plan.  Let us lead your financial adventure so you can focus on enjoying it!
