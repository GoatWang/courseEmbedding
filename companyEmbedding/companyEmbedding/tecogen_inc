Reimagining Energy Efficiency
At Tecogen, we pride ourselves on being the leading manufacturer of clean energy solutions



 







	About






Next-Generation Manufacturer of Distributed Generation Products The original designer of packaged combined heat and power (“CHP” or “cogeneration”) equipment, for over three decades Tecogen has pioneered the development of efficient, reliable and clean technologies for on-site energy production. With over 2,400 units shipped, the company has an industry-leading reputation for delivering quality, technically superior products that reduce energy costs, cut greenhouse gas emissions and alleviate congestion on the national power grid. 









Pioneering cleaner and more affordable energy
Environmental concerns, economic viability, grid and building resiliency, policy initiatives and social responsibility are all factors driving the need for increased use of reliable, clean and efficient on-site energy systems. For over 30 years we have been helping customers integrate distributed energy resources into their facilities. We share our customers’ pioneering passion for reliable, cleaner and more affordable energy. 







Specifically trained personnel focused on supporting our CHP products
We have multiple service centers located in California, the Midwest and the Northeast. Our support organization is a distinctive competency, with personnel specifically trained and focused on supporting Tecogen’s gas engine-driven systems alone. Tecogen takes great pride in its exceptional care of equipment and customers, well beyond the date of sale. 









Applications  Our clean energy and emissions control systems are well suited for a wide variety of facilities ranging from residential and educational buildings to recreational and commercial facilities. Facilities that Benefit from our Products








Cutting Edge Technology 
All of our Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems use cutting edge technology to generate electrical power, along with thermal power recovered from the natural gas engine. Though a valuable source of energy, thermal power is usually lost in electrical production in the form of waste heat. However, captured and recycled thermal power can be used for very energy demanding heating processes, such as heating spaces and water. How our Technology Works








Ultra Efficient Products  Our ultra-efficient products include cogeneration modules, which provide electricity and heat, and chillers, which provide air-conditioning and optional free hot water. Our products supply electrical power or mechanical power for cooling, as well as free engine heat that gets recovered and purposefully used at customer facilities. Broadly speaking, they are all considered Combined Heat and Power (CHP) systems.                       
Our design team focuses on the development of standardized, modular, small-scale products, with a limited number of product configurations and a high degree of factory pre-packaging, so that quick and successful application in a wide variety of customer facilities can be achieved, simplifying field installation and avoiding costly custom design. Start Producing Cleaner Energy








A History of Market-Leading Innovations 
We pride ourselves on having been there first, with innovative, new and better ideas, on numerous occasions. We commercialize, refine and support these pioneering concepts over the long haul for the benefit of our customers. What We’ve Been Up To Since the 1960s









Industry Affiliations 
We are an active and leading member of numerous industry associations that support clean CHP and energy efficiency. 




























Leadership
Our team proudly boasts more than 100 years of combined industry experience.

CHP Products Offer “Two for the Price of One”
Combined Heat & Power (CHP) is truly a way to get “two for the price of one.” CHP is also sometimes referred to as electrical or mechanical cogeneration. With CHP, you can make the electricity or cooling power that you need, plus capture much of the thermal energy that is normally lost during the energy conversion into power. With CHP, the “waste” thermal energy is captured and put to good use on site, for heating water or building spaces. A normally very energy intensive task (heating), is now accomplished at no additional cost to the customer or environment. This double-duty translates into significant energy and cost savings for you, as well as proportional decreases in carbon footprint and greenhouse gas emissions.
With efficient cogeneration, you get the electricity and heat that your building needs (or, alternatively, the chilled water and heat), for a lot less money and a lot more reliably.







A Variety of Products to Suit Your Facility’s Needs










CHP









Chillers









Water Heaters









Emissions Control











CHP
With our CHP system, you get both electricity and heat for your building, from a single fuel source, resulting in dramatic savings on your energy bills. The engine’s mechanical energy is used to drive a generator that produces electricity while at the same time the engine’s free waste heat gets recovered to satisfy building heating needs. This is sometimes referred to as “electrical” cogeneration. View CHP Products



 
















Chillers
With a TECOCHILL chiller system, you get both chilling and heat for your building, from a single fuel source, resulting in dramatic savings on your energy bills. The engine's mechanical energy is used to drive a compressor that produces chilled water, while the engine's free waste heat can be recovered to satisfy simultaneous building heating needs. This is sometimes referred to as "mechanical" cogeneration. Because your chillers are powered by natural gas - your facility can stay cool, even in a blackout. View Chiller Products











Gas Heat Pumps
ILIOS offers a progressive approach to water heating fueled by clean burning, plentiful natural gas or propane. Cut your gas bill in half by replacing or supplementing a conventional boiler with an Ilios water heater. View Gas Heat Pump Products



 
















Emissions Control
Our Ultera low emissions control kits deliver simple, cost-effective and robust solutions for meeting even the most stringent emissions standards. The patented Ultera system is available as an option on all our clean energy equipment, bringing emissions of harmful pollutants down to near-zero levels, or for installation on select rich-burn natural gas engines and standby generators from other manufacturers.
