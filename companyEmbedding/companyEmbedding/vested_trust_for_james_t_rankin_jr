ORDER
DUFFY, District Judge.
This matter is currently before the court on Defendant GreatBanc Trust Company's ("GreatBanc") Motion for Summary Judgment of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint. GreatBanc's chief argument for summary judgment is that neither Larry Register nor Esther Houlihan have standing to bring a breach of fiduciary claim against it because neither former employee is a "participant" in the plan at issue.
Defendants Hagemeyer North America, Inc. ("Hagemeyer"), Cameron & Barkley Company ("C & B"), M. Joel Bateman, J. Randall Bishop, Paula P. Greer, Kenneth B. Sands, William T. Tamsberg, James Warren, Paula P. Greer, Debra J. Guest, David G. Gundling, Sandra Gussman, Deborah B. Holden, Andros Neocleous, Christopher C. Nowell, Kim Palmer, Raymond Perlock, and Jeffrey S. Rosenberg (collectively, the "C & B Defendants")1 have also  filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, adopting the reasoning set forth in Defendant GreatBanc's Memorandum, as have Defendants Cambar Software, Inc. ("CSI"), Mary Lou Fox, David L. Lea, Steven L. Raber, Thomas A. Skelton, Cecil Duffie, Cheryl Blocker, Allison Mahoney, Amy Mahoney, and Thomas Stallings (collectively, the "CSI Defendants").2
In these Motions, Defendants3 raise various arguments in favor of summary judgment; however, because the standing challenge first raised by Defendant GreatBanc calls into question this court's subject matter jurisdiction, it is appropriate to address this issue at the outset. And because the court, after careful consideration, finds that Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue this action, Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment are granted.
BACKGROUND4
The facts of this case, as supported by the evidence and viewed in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, are as follows:
C & B was a distributor of maintenance, repair and operating products to the electrical construction industry. It formed C & B Employee Stock Ownership Plan ("C & B ESOP") in 1975. C & B ESOP was an employee pension benefit plan within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 1002(2)(A), and was administered in South Carolina.
C & B created Cambar Software, Inc. ("CSI") in 1981. CSI employees were eligible to and did participate in the C & B ESOP. As a result, certain participants in the C & B ESOP were allocated shares of both C & B and CSI stock, as well as a share of the C & B ESOP's other assets. Other participants were allocated shares of either C & B or CSI stock, but not both, as well as a share of the C & B ESOP's other assets.
In or around September of 2000, C & B entered into an agreement whereby Hagemeyer would acquire complete ownership of C & B, but not CSI ("Merger Agreement"). Because Hagemeyer was not interested in purchasing CSI, the Merger Agreement separated the C & ESOP into two plans, the C & B ESOP and a new CSI ESOP. Participants were classified as either "C & B Participants" or "CSI Participants," depending on where they were currently or last employed. CSI Participants, and their accompanying assets and liabilities, were to be spun off to the new CSI ESOP. C & B Participants were to remain in the C & B ESOP, which was to be incorporated into a profit sharing 401(k) plan sponsored by Hagemeyer.
Upon consummation of the merger, each share of C & B's common stock was converted into $736.45 per share in cash and the contingent right to receive a pro rata share of the amount to be distributed from an indemnity escrow fund. At this point, the still intact C & B ESOP contained' only CSI common stock and other assets, including cash from the conversion of the C & B stock. C & B Participants were given the option of rolling over their share of the distribution either into a 401(k) plan or into an individual retirement account  ("IRA"). CSI Participants' distributions were placed into an account for other CSI assets under the C & B ESOP.
Using the cash from the sale of C & B stock, CSI then bought back common shares in itself from the C & B Participants. For purposes of this exchange of CSI stock for cash, the CSI stock was severely overvalued. This overvalued stock plummeted in value after the spin-off. As a result, CSI Participants' retirement funds are worth less than what they were worth prior to the merger and spin-off.
While the merger was still pending, some participants were awaiting distributions from the C & B ESOP. On December 11, 2000, at the direction of the C & B ESOP's Advisory Committee, GreatBanc made a distribution to Rufus Barkley, an officer or member of the Board of Directors of C & B. For the distribution, C & B ESOP cashed out Barkley's account which had been allocated a total of 2113.11 shares of CSI stock. At the time, the C & B ESOP fiduciaries had valued CSI stock at the inflated price of $28.64 per share.5 On December 22, 2000, the C & B ESOP Advisory Committee authorized the payment of benefits to other participants awaiting distributions. These participants also received distributions for their allocations of CSI stock at the inflated price of $28.64 per share. As a result of these distributions, certain current and past executives and employees of C & B received a profits wind-fall, while CSI Participants were left with CSI stock worth far less than it had originally been worth.
Plaintiffs Larry Register and Esther Houlihan are former employees of Defendants C & B and CSI. As employees, Plaintiffs participated in these companies' ESOPs. During the spin-off, both Plaintiffs were classified as CSI Participants. Both individual Plaintiffs voluntarily terminated their employment with C & B and CSI. Plaintiff Register requested distribution of his CSI ESOP account, and his account balance was rolled over into the IRA he designated on April 15, 2002. He subsequently received a check for the balance of his CSI ESOP account on September 27, 2004. Plaintiff Houlihan received her benefits on October 1, 2004.
Plaintiffs originally filed this ERISA action against Defendants on August 15, 2003. On August 11, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, in which they asserted the following ERISA-based causes of action6 against the fiduciaries of the C & B ESOP and the CSI ESOP:7
(I) breach of fiduciary and co-fiduciary duties by authorizing and making exchanges of CSI stock for what the fiduciaries knew or should have known was more than the fair market value in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)-(D) and 29 U.S.C. § 1105 [Count I, Complaint ¶ 56];
(II) breach of fiduciary duty to monitor the plan and duty of loyalty to the plan in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)-(B) [Count II, Complaint ¶¶ 65-68];
(III) breach of fiduciary duty with respect to offsets of accrued pension  benefits with artificially inflated CSI stock in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)-(D) [Count III, Complaint ¶¶ 75-78];
(IV) breach of fiduciary and co-fiduciary duties by failing to monitor the conduct of the investing fiduciaries and failing to disclose to the investing fiduciaries material facts concerning CSI's financial condition in violation of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. § 1104(a)(1)(A)-(B) and 29 U.S.C. § 1105 [Count IV, Complaint ¶¶ 82-84]; and
(V)" Defendant CSI violated ERISA § 104(b)(4), 29 U.S.C. § 1024(b)(4),8 by failing to promptly respond to Plaintiffs' request for the governing Summary Plan descriptions.
As a result of the Defendant fiduciaries' breaches of their duties, Plaintiffs allege that the value of the stock the CSI Participants received in the merger and spinoff of the plans was wrongfully diminished. As such, they and the other CSI Participants' suffered actual losses to their individual CSI ESOP accounts. [Complaint ¶¶ 61, 74, 77, 86.] Because the fiduciaries' violations of ERISA allegedly resulted in real losses to Plaintiffs and to the other participants of the CSI ESOP, Plaintiffs seek in Counts I, II, III, and IV both (1) equitable relief pursuant to ERISA §§ 502(a)(3), 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(3), and (2) recovery for losses to the Plan caused by Defendants' breaches of their fiduciary duties pursuant to ERISA § 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(2), and § 409(a), 29 U.S.C. § 1109(a). [Complaint ¶¶ 58, 59, 62, 69, 79, 87.] Further, in Count V of the Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that they were prejudiced by CSI's failure to timely provide plan documents, in violation of ERISA § 104(b)(4), 29 U.S.C. § 1024(b)(4). [Complaint ¶ 91.] Accordingly, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to $110 per day commencing thirty days after the first request for information was made to the date of Defendant CSI's response to the request, as provided by ERISA § 502(c); 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).9 [Complaint ¶ 92.]
On December 13, 2006, Defendant GreatBanc filed a Motion for Summary Judgment, contending that Plaintiffs are former employees who have received their full distribution from the ERISA-based. Plan; accordingly, they no longer have standing as "participants" to pursue a civil action under ERISA § 502, 29 U.S.C. § 1132.
DISCUSSION
This case involves the question whether Plaintiffs are "participants" in a CSI employee benefit plan, as defined under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The civil actions asserted by Plaintiffs may be  brought under ERISA only by a plan "participant," "beneficiary," or "fiduciary." 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) -(3); 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c).10 This is both a standing and a subject matter jurisdictional requirement. Stanton v. Gulf Oil Corp., 792 F.2d 432, 434 (4th Cir.1986). Plaintiffs, who are former employees and former members of the CSI ESOP, purport to bring this action as "participants." In order to do so, Plaintiffs must meet the statutory definition of participant at the time the action was brought and maintain that status throughout their lawsuit. LaLonde v. Textron, Inc., 418 F.Supp.2d 16, 19 (D.R.I. 2006) (citing Crawford v. Lamantia, 34 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1994) (plaintiffs status at the time the injury occurred is not relevant for standing purposes)).
ERISA defines "participant" as "any employee or former employee of an employer . . . who is or may become eligible to receive a benefit of any type from an employee benefit plan which covers employees of such employer . . . or whose beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit." 29 U.S.C. § 1002(7). The Supreme Court has elaborated on this definition by explaining that former employees may be participants if they have (1) a reasonable expectation of returning to covered employment, or (2) a colorable claim to vested benefits. See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 117, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). Thus, if a plaintiff has a legitimate claim for vested benefits, he has standing irrespective of having received his full distribution from the ERISA-based Plan. Id.; see, e.g., Swinney v. General Motors Corp., 46 F.3d 512, 518 (6th Cir.1995) (explaining the "but for" exception and noting that a plaintiff who has divested himself of his plan holdings because of actions by the defendant has standing if he can show that he will prevail in a suit for benefits or that eligibility requirements will be fulfilled in the future); see also, Rankin v. Rots, 220 F.R.D. 511 (E.D.Mich.2004) (finding that plaintiff who divested herself of her plan holdings still had a colorable claim for vested benefits). In Sommers Drug Stores Co. Employee Profit Sharing Trust v. Corrigan, which is cited by both Plaintiffs and Defendants, the Fifth Circuit explained that the line between "vested benefits" and "damages" is not always clear. 883 F.2d 345, 347-50 (5th Cir.1989). The Court attempted to articulate the distinction as follows: an allegation that benefits were wrongly computed clearly states a claim for vested benefits; on the other hand, a claim for an unascertainable amount, with no demonstration that recovery would directly effect payments to the plaintiff, states a claim for damages. Id. at 349-50.
Here, Plaintiffs assert that, despite the fact that they have received all of their benefits under the plain terms of the ESOP, they still have a "colorable claim to vested benefits."11 [Response to GreatBanc's Mot. at 6.] Specifically, they assert that they "are not seeking damages based on what their assets might have accrued to in the future had the fiduciaries not acted imprudently[; r]ather, . . . they both seek the value of their vested benefits in the C & B ESOP at the time of the fraudulent activity." Accordingly, Plaintiffs ask the court to require Defendants to compensate the ESOP, and therefore, all participants, for the value their shares lost due to Defendants' allegedly imprudent valuation of the CSI stock in the spin-off.
 The court finds, however, that even if Plaintiffs can definitively prove the correct valuation of the CSI stock at the time of the spin-off,12 the court can only speculate as to what the value of the assets following the spin-off would have been but for the incorrect valuation. As such, Plaintiffs can not identify a definite ascertainable value lost due to the fiduciaries' breach of duty. Many courts have deemed similar requests for "lost value" to be too speculative to amount to a legitimate claim for "vested benefits." See, e.g., Crawford v. Lamantia, 34 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir.1994) (plaintiffs request that the court use its "equitable powers" to allocate funds to him and other ESOP members who were "cashed out" after defendants' going-private transaction did not establish the value the ESOP lost in the transaction and was deemed too speculative to amount to a legitimate claim for "vested benefits"); Kuntz v. Reese, 785 F.2d 1410, 1411 (9th Cir.1986) (finding plaintiffs were not plan participants "[b]ecause, if successful, the plaintiffs' claim would result in a damages award, not in an increase of vested benefit") (emphasis added); Yancy v. Am. Petrofina, 768 F.2d 707, 709 (5th Cir.1985) (the plaintiffs claim for a sum that could not have been earned "cannot be considered as vested under ERISA"); In re AEP Erisa Litigation, 437 F.Supp.2d 750, 759 (S.D.Ohio 2006) (having divested himself of his holdings in ERISA plan after he filed ERISA suit asserting breach of fiduciary duty, former employee lacked standing to bring suit under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2) because his asserted right to sum that possibly could have been earned by prudent investment decisions sought damages that were too speculative to be considered vested under ERISA); LaLonde v. Textron, Inc., 418 F.Supp.2d 16 (D.R.I.2006) (finding that where plaintiffs did not claim that certain benefits were withheld or miscalculated, but rather, that Defendants' improper investment decisions concerning defendants' stock resulted in diminished plan value, their claim was not a claim for vested benefits); Hargrave v. TXU Corp., 392 F.Supp.2d 785 (N.D.Tex.2005) (plaintiffs' allegations that the plan had been undervalued was a claim for "additional damages that might have accrued but for the Defendants' alleged misconduct"; these damages are too speculative to be considered "vested" under ERISA); In re Guidant Corporation ERISA Litig., 2006 WL 2828882 (S.D.Ind. Sept. 15, 2006) (where plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew from the Plan after filing suit, and did not claim that their distribution was less due to an error in calculation, plaintiffs had no "colorable claim for benefits"). But see Sommers, 883 F.2d at 349 (holding that where plaintiffs asserted that the amount of money received and distributed to plan participants pursuant to the stock sale did not reflect the full value of benefits due under the terms of the plan, plaintiffs had essentially stated a claim for the unpaid value of vested benefits (i.e. the value not reflected in the stock's selling price); thus, the court found the claim "close to a simple claim that benefits were miscalculated," and held that plaintiffs were "participants," having standing under ERISA).
 The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has not yet weighed in on whether a claim for value lost due to a fiduciaries breach of duty is a claim for vested benefits or for damages. In a recent case from this Circuit, however, the Honorable Judge Frederick Motz of the District of Maryland was presented with the issue of whether former participants in an ERISA plan had standing under circumstances similar to those presented here. In re Mutual Funds Invest. Litig., 2006 WL 2381056, *1 (D.Md. Aug. 15, 2006). In that case, plaintiffs were former employees of defendants who had participated in defined contribution plans sponsored by their employees. Id. These former employees, who had received distributions from the plans after terminating their employment, claimed that, while they were still invested in the plans, the defendants breached their fiduciary duties under ERISA and caused substantial losses to the plans. Id. As a result of these losses, the plaintiffs' distributions were less than they should have been. Id. The plaintiffs thereafter brought a cause of action under ERISA § 502(a)(2), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2), seeking to recover from the fiduciaries the "losses to the Plan." Id. Judge Motz noted that "numerous courts have found that former participants in an ERISA plan lack standing under circumstances similar to those presented here." Id. (citing Graden v. Conexant Sys., Inc., No. 05-0695, 2006 WL 1098233 at *3, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16176 at *8 (D.N.J. Mar. 31, 2006); In re RCN Litig., No. 04-5068(SRC), 2006 WL 753149 at *14 (D.N.J. Mar. 21, 2006); Holtzscher v. Dynegy, Inc., No. Civ. A. 05-3293, 2006 WL 626402 at *5 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 13, 2006); LaLonde v. Textron, C.A. No. 02-334S, 2006 WL 519671 at *5 (D.R.I. Mar. 1, 2006); In re Admin. Comm. Erisa Litig., No. C03-3302 PJF, 2005 WL 3454126 at *5 (N.D.Cal. Dec. 16, 2005)). Judge Motz, concurring with the decisions in the above-cited cases, concluded that, "[a]lthough . . . the question is a close one," the causes of action asserted in this action were "more in the nature of claims for damages than for payment of a vested benefit." In re Mutual Funds Invest. Litig., 2006 WL 2381056, *1. Accordingly, Judge Motz dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Id.
In the case sub judice, it is uncontested that Plaintiffs are former employees who received distribution of their vested benefits under the CSI ESOP on September 27, 2004 and October 1, 2004. Plaintiffs do not allege that their distributions were improperly computed; rather, they allege that Defendants' breach of their fiduciary duties caused the Plan's assets at the time of the distributions to have been diminished. The difference between what Plaintiffs' accounts might have been worth had the CSI stock been properly valued during the spin-off and what the accounts actually were worth at the time of distribution is not a benefit that is promised under the terms of the ESOP. Under these facts, the court finds that the recovery requested is more in the nature of claims for damages than for payment of a vested benefit. Accordingly, because Plaintiffs have no reasonable expectation of returning to CSI as employees, and have failed to prove that they have a "colorable claim" to "vested benefits" within the meaning of ERISA, Plaintiffs are not "participants" as meant by ERISA and therefore lack standing to pursue their claims pursuant to ERISA § 502; 29 U.S.C. § 1132.
CONCLUSION
It is therefore ORDERED, for the foregoing reasons, that Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment are GRANTED. It is further ORDERED that all other  motions currently pending before the court are DISMISSED AS MOOT.
AND IT IS SO ORDERED.


FootNotes 
1. At all times relevant to this action, M. Joel Bateman, J. Randall Bishop, Paula Greer, Kenneth B. Sands, William T. Tamsberg, and James Warren were members of the C & B ESOP Advisory Committee. Paula Greer, Debra J. Guest, David G. Gundling, Sandra Gussman, Deborah B. Holden, Andros Neocleous. Christopher C. Nowell, Kim Palmer, Raymond Perlock, and Jeffrey Rosenberg were members of the Administrative Committee of the Hagemeyer Plan or its predecessor, the Cambar 401(k) Plan.

2. At all times relevant to this action, Mary Lou Fox, Thomas A. Skelton, and Steven L. Raber were member of the CSI Board of Directors. David L. Lea was the President and/or acting Chief Executive Officer of C & B. Cecil Duffie is the current Chief Executive Officer of CSI. Cheryl Blocker, Allison Mahoney, Amy Mahoney, and Thomas. Stallings were members of the CSI ESOP Advisory Committee.

3. For purposes of this order, the court refers to GreatBanc, the CSI Defendants, and the C & B Defendants collectively as "Defendants."

4. In describing the facts of this case, the court limits its discussion to those facts relevant to deciding the issue of standing.

5. Since its inception in 1988, CSI's stock was consistently valued in the range of $10 to $15.

6. The Second Amended Complaint also asserted causes of action for quantum meruit recovery, violation of federal securities laws, and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The court dismissed these causes of action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) by Order dated November 3, 2006.

7. In paragraph 52 of the Complaint, Plaintiffs assert that C & B, CSI, and each of the named Defendants are fiduciaries under ERISA.

8. Section 104(b)(4) of ERISA provides that "[t]he administrator shall, upon written request of any participant or beneficiary, furnish a copy of the latest updated summary, plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated."

9. ERISA § 502(c) 29 U.S.C. § 1132(c) provides that "[a]ny administrator . . . (B) who fails or refuses to comply with a request for any information which such administrator is required by this Act to furnish to a participant or beneficiary (unless such failure or refusal results from matters reasonably beyond the control of the administrator) by mailing the material requested to the last known address of the requesting participant or beneficiary within 30 days after such request may in the court's discretion be personally liable to such participant or beneficiary in the amount of up to $100 a day from the date of such failure or refusal, and the court may in its discretion order such other relief as it deems proper." For purposes of this paragraph, . . . each violation described in subparagraph (B) with respect to any single participant or beneficiary, shall be treated as a separate violation.

10. The Secretary of Labor is also authorized to bring a civil action pursuant to 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(2).

11. Plaintiffs do not contest that they have no reasonable expectation of returning to CSI as employees.

12. Defendants assert that Plaintiffs have presented no evidence of the correct valuation of the CSI stock. They claim that Plaintiffs were required to retain their own expert witness to ascertain a value of the CSI shares as of the dates they claim the stock was overvalued, and may not rely on the Report provided by the Secretary of Labor's expert, Randolph Whitt. Plaintiffs demur, asserting that their reliance on the report of expert Randolph Whitt is proper due to the consolidation of the Secretary's case with their own case. For the reasons stated above, the court reaches its ultimate conclusion without ruling upon the admissibility of Mr. Whitt's Report.

What advisors want from retirement plan record-keepers

At the end of the second quarter of 2016, total assets in defined contribution plans hit $7 trillion, according to research from the Investment Company Institute and BrightScope.

Retirement plan offered by Trump pick Puzder sheds light on Labor rule

Fast food executive Andy Puzder, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to head the Labor Department, could be in a position to undermine the agency's new rule on retirement advice which has long been opposed by the financial industry.

The plan is less generous than some of its fast food competitors, according to data and analysis from Brightscope Inc, a research company that rates 401k plans.

In 2015, CKE opted not to match the retirement contributions of the plan's participants, according to Labor Department data.

The plan also carries high-fee investments, has low participation and generally scores worse than many of its rivals even in the notoriously high-turnover, low-benefit fast-food industry, according to Brightscope.

The CKE plan suggests that Puzder will bring "more of an industry-friendly perspective to the office," said Mike Alfred, managing director at Brightscope, which ranks it below those at Jack in the Box, McDonalds and Yum! Brands Inc.

Mum on DOL rule, Labor chief appointee Andy Puzder's 'check-the-box' 401(k) plan at CKE Restaurants speaks volumes

The newly announced Secretary of Labor is best known for his stance on keeping minimum wages minimal but his actions as a plan sponsor of a 20,200-employee firm show he is inclined to minimize 401(k) participation and matching, too.

Subject to Senate confirmation, Andy Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc., the parent company of fast food chains Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr., will be the next Secretary of Labor. 

"They’re really saying ‘we checked the box,’ getting by with the bare minimum in their offering," says Mike Alfred, co-founder and CEO of BrightScope Inc. about CKE's pension plan. See: RIAs are set to capture chunks of the $26 billion that GM is spinning out of its pension plan.

981 F.2d 6816 Employee Benefits Cas. 1112

Thomas B. HEALY, Jr., Plaintiff-Appellant,v.RICH PRODUCTS CORP., Defendant-Appellee.

 No. 86, Docket 92-7398.

United States Court of Appeals,Second Circuit.

 Argued Sept. 14, 1992. Decided Dec. 7, 1992.

Bettina B. Plevan, New York City (Myron D. Rumeld, Roberta K.Chevlowe, Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, New York City, of counsel), for plaintiff-appellant.Paul B. Zuydhoek, Buffalo, N.Y. (Hugh M. Jones, Mark E. Brand, DavidR. Hayes, Phillips, Lytle, Hitchcock, Blaine & Huber, of counsel), for defendant-appellee.Before MINER, ALTIMARI and WALKER, Circuit Judges.MINER, Circuit Judge:1Plaintiff-appellant Thomas B. Healy, Jr. appeals from a judgment entered onMarch 5, 1992 in the United States District Court for the Western District of  New York (Elfvin, J.) rejecting on summary judgment motion plaintiff's claimthat certain pension plan benefits were preserved by the terms of an exceptionto a general release executed in connection with a stock purchase agreement,and rejecting after trial plaintiff's claim to reform the release exception for mutual mistake and fraud. In an order entered on April 1, 1991, 1991 WL46514, Judge Elfvin partially granted defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment, ruling, as a matter of law, that the meaning of the exception languagefound in the general release clause of the stock purchase agreement (the"Purchase Agreement") entered into between Healy and defendant RichProducts Corp. ("Rich Products") was governed by the Employee RetirementIncome Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. § 1001 et seq. (1988), ("ERISA"), and
























 

BACKGROUNDthat the language did not preserve Healy's right to receive certain pension plan benefits. Judge Elfvin denied both parties' cross-motions for summary judgment on the issue of reformation of the release exception and scheduled a bench trial. After the bench trial, on March 5, 1992, 1992 WL 50924, JudgeElfvin rejected the reformation claim and directed the entry of judgmentdismissing Healy's complaint.2From 1961 until 1987 Healy was an employee and officer of Rich Products. He,his wife Joanne, and their children held thirty-six percent of the common stock of Rich Products as a result of gifts of stock made over the years by Joanne'sfather, Robert Rich, Sr. ("Rich"), Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Rich Products. Rich at all times held voting control of the company. In the Fallof 1987, Joanne Healy, on the advice of her counsel, Francis J. McConnell,refused to sign a Buy-Sell Agreement and a Shareholder Agreement submittedto her by her father. The agreement contained voting and transfer restrictions onher Rich Products stock that were designed to insure that the company wouldremain under the control of the Rich family. Joanne Healy's refusal to signthese agreements resulted in a rift between Rich and the Healy family,culminating in Thomas Healy's resignation in December 1987.3At the time of his resignation and since 1978, Healy was a participant in two benefit plans provided by Rich Products: a Deferred Compensation Agreement(the "DCA") and an Incentive Compensation Plan (the "ICP") (collectively the"Plans"). He also was a participant in a 401(k) pension plan, which is not atissue here. Pursuant to the terms of the DCA, Healy was entitled to certainannual benefits for fifteen years following his retirement, disability, death or other termination of employment. The ICP, also known as the phantom stock  plan, provided that Healy would periodically be awarded "units," each of whichentitled him to future payments based on the company's book value, divided by1,000,000. Healy was to receive payments upon his retirement, disability, deathor other termination of employment. The ICP benefits were to be paid annuallyfor ten years, and an administrative committee was formed to oversee thedistribution of payments. Both Plans contained "no-competition" provisions,the violation of which could result in forfeiture or suspension of benefits. Under the DCA, participants agreed not to compete with Rich Products for two yearsfollowing the termination of employment. The ICP prohibited competition for an unlimited period of time. Both Plans also provided that the benefits were notsubject to assignment, alienation or encumbrance.4In the Spring of 1988, after his resignation, Healy received the first installment



















 

of benefits due under the DCA--$44,615, and the first installment due under theICP--$30,564. After these initial payments, $624,610 under the DCA and$275,076 under the ICP remained to be paid. Healy was paid $281,053 fromthe 401(k) pension plan in a lump sum upon his resignation.5In May 1988, Jonathan Golden, Rich Products' attorney, contacted McConnellto propose an immediate buy-out of the Healys' Rich Products stock and relatedinterests. After extended negotiations, the parties ultimately agreed that Richwould pay twenty-five million dollars for the Healys' interests. Prior to thedrafting of the agreement, a question arose concerning the earnings of certainSubchapter-S corporations in which the Healys owned shares of stock. Theshares were scheduled to be transferred as part of the agreement. The earningsof these corporations had not been distributed to any of the stockholders, andthe Healys' share of undistributed earnings amounted to $134,821.43. AlthoughRich was adamant about paying "twenty-five million dollars and not one centmore," Healy inquired as to whether his family's share of such earnings would be paid despite the Purchase Agreement. Rich initially refused. However,Golden explained that even if Rich refused to pay the Healys their shares of thedistributions, the Healys' pro rata share of the distributions would be imputed tothem as taxable income. Thus, the Healys would incur a tax liability of twenty-eight percent of the earnings, effectively reducing the twenty-five million dollar  purchase price. Considering these facts, Rich agreed to pay an additionalamount equal to the tax liability of the Subchapter-S corporations attributableto the Healys.6Golden prepared the first draft of the Purchase Agreement and transmitted it byfacsimile to McConnell on August 9, 1988. The draft included a provision for the execution of a General Release, releasing Rich Products from any and allliabilities and claims. Healy testified that after he reviewed the first draft, hespecifically told McConnell that he wanted to make it very clear that he did notwant to release his benefits under the Plans. McConnell testified that he advisedGolden that Healy did not want to release his remaining benefits or continuing benefits under the Rich Products pension and profit-sharing plans. McConnelltestified that when Golden asked which plans McConnell was referring to, hereplied by describing in detail both plans and the specific amount of benefitsavailable to Healy under each plan. He told Golden that Healy already hadreceived the first installment under each plan. McConnell's testimony issupported by the contemporaneous notes he wrote in the margin of the draft:"not waiving continuing pension benefits, 15 years and profit-sharing, earlyretirement." McConnell further testified that although he did not specify thePlans by name when he first proposed an exception to the General Release, heidentified both plans by name to Golden in a later conversation relating to the

  Directors
 Each Federal Reserve Bank has a nine member board: three Class A and three Class B directors, who are elected by the stockholding member banks, and three Class C directors, who are appointed by the Board of Governors. 
 Class A directors represent the stockholding member banks in each Federal Reserve District. Class B and Class C directors represent the public and are chosen with due, but not exclusive, consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumers; they may not be officers, directors, or employees of any bank or bank holding company. In addition, Class C directors may not be stockholders of any bank or bank holding company. 
 For the election of Class A and Class B directors, the member banks of each Federal Reserve District are classified into three groups. Each group, which comprises banks with similar capitalization, elects one Class A director and one Class B director. Annually, the Board of Governors designates one of the Class C directors as chair of the board and Federal Reserve agent of each District Bank, and it designates another Class C director as deputy chair. 
 Federal Reserve Branches have either five or seven directors, a majority of whom are appointed by the parent Federal Reserve Bank; the others are appointed by the Board of Governors. One of the directors appointed by the Board is designated annually as chair of the board of that Branch in a manner prescribed by the parent Federal Reserve Bank. 
The chairs and deputy chairs of the Reserve Bank boards of directors, and the chairs of the Branches, are listed in the preceding table, titled "Officers." The directors of the Banks and Branches are listed in the following table. For each director, the class of directorship, the director's principal organizational affiliation, and the date the director's term expires are shown.

Board of Governors Advisory Councils

In this Section:


Federal Advisory Council
Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council
Model Validation Council







The Federal Reserve System uses advisory committees in carrying out its varied responsibilities. Three of these committees advise the Board of Governors directly: the Federal Advisory Council, the Consumer Advisory Council, and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council. These councils, whose members are drawn from each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, meet two to four times a year. The individual Reserve Banks have advisory committees as well, including thrift institutions advisory committees, small business committees, and agricultural advisory committees. Moreover, officials from all Reserve Banks meet periodically in various committees. To learn more, visit www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/advisorydefault.htm.
Federal Advisory Council
The Federal Advisory Council--a statutory body established under the Federal Reserve Act--consults with and advises the Board of Governors on all matters within the Board's jurisdiction. It is composed of one representative from each Federal Reserve District, chosen by the Reserve Bank in that District. The Federal Reserve Act requires the council to meet in Washington, D.C., at least four times a year. Three members of the council serve as its president, vice president, and secretary. In 2012, it met on February 2-3, May 10-11, September 13-14, and December 13-14. The council met with the Board on February 3, May 11, September 14, and December 14, 2012.

Model Validation Council
The Model Validation Council was established in 2012 by the Board of Governors to provide expert and independent advice on its process to rigorously assess the models used in stress tests of banking institutions. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act required the Federal Reserve to conduct annual stress tests of large bank holding companies and systemically important, nonbank financial institutions supervised by the Board. The Model Validation Council provides input on the Board's efforts to assess the effectiveness of the models used in the stress tests. The council is intended to improve the quality of the Federal Reserve's model assessment program and to strengthen the confidence in the integrity and independence of the program.

Federal Reserve Bank Branches

In this Section:


Reserve Bank and Branch Directors
Reserve Bank and Branch Officers
Officer Conferences







To carry out the day-to-day operations of the Federal Reserve System, the nation has been divided into 12 Federal Reserve Districts, each with a Reserve Bank. As required by the Federal Reserve Act of 1913, each of the Reserve Banks is supervised by a board of directors who are familiar with economic and credit conditions in the District. Similarly, each of the 24 Reserve Bank Branches has a board of directors who are familiar with conditions in the area encompassed by the Branch.
Reserve Bank and Branch Directors
Each Federal Reserve Bank has a nine-member board with three different classes of directors: three Class A directors, who are nominated and elected by the member banks in that District to represent the stockholding banks; three Class B directors, who are nominated and elected by the member banks to represent the public; and three Class C directors, who are appointed by the Board of Governors to represent the public. Class B and Class C directors are selected with due, but not exclusive, consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor, and consumers. For the election of Class A and Class B directors, the member banks of each Federal Reserve District are classified into three groups. Each group, which is comprised of banks with similar capitalization, elects one Class A director and one Class B director. Directors are elected or appointed to three-year terms on a rotating basis so, barring any unexpected resignations, one position becomes available for each class of director each year. Annually, the Board of Governors designates one Class C director to serve as chair, and another Class C director to serve as deputy chair, of each Reserve Bank board.
Pursuant to the Federal Reserve Act, Class B and Class C directors may not be officers, directors, or employees of any bank, and Class C directors may not hold stock in any bank. In order to give full and meaningful effect to these restrictions, as well as the requirement that Class B and Class C directors be selected with consideration for sectors of the economy beyond banking, it is the Board's policy that Class B and Class C directors may not be affiliated with, and Class C directors may not hold stock in, certain other institutions that are also subject to the System's supervision.
Each Federal Reserve Bank Branch also has a board with either five or seven directors. A majority of the Branch directors are appointed by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the remaining directors appointed by the Board of Governors. Branch directors appointed by the Reserve Bank are subject to the same eligibility requirements as Class A or Class B directors. Board-appointed Branch directors must meet the same requirements as Class B directors.
For more information on Reserve Bank and Branch directors, see www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/directors/about.htm.
The directors of the Banks and Branches are listed below. For each director, the class of directorship, the director's principal business, and the expiration date of the director's term are shown.

Reserve Bank and Branch Officers
As mentioned, each Federal Reserve Bank and its branches has a board of directors. The officers of each Bank and Branch are drawn from this pool of directors. Specifically, two directors of each Reserve Bank are designated by the Board of Governors as chair 1 and deputy chair, respectively, of their nine-member board. Each Reserve Bank also has a president and first vice president, who are appointed by the board of directors of the Bank, subject to approval by the Board of Governors. Additionally, each District Branch also has a chair, who is selected from among those Branch directors appointed by the Board of Governors.
