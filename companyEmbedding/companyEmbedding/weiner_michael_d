Michael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), better known by his professional name Michael Savage,[1] is an American radio host, author, activist, nutritionist, and conservative political commentator. He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.[2][3] Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.[8]
Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism,[9] while critics have characterized them as "fostering extremism."[10] He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.
Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner[1] in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,[15] Jewish emigrants from Russia.[15][16][17][18] He described his childhood as difficult.[16] His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.[19] Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57[17] in 1970,[20] and his mother died in 2003.[15]
After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[21][22] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[17] After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself.[16] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[23][24] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[25] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[26]
Shift in political opinions[edit]
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s.[27] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a "calling card."[16][27] Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[16][28] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."[18] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[16]
Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[27] Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[27] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."[18] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[29] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[30] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic.[31] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[32] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.[27] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[33]
Career as commentator[edit]
Main article: The Savage Nation
Radio[edit]
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[27][34] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.
In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10 million listeners per week,[35] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein."[36] Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."[18]
By 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[2][3] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[17][37]
On September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles.[38] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."[39] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[40]
On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[30] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.
On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.[41] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[42] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[43] On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[44][45]
In January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[46]
MSNBC television show[edit]
Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"[28] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."[47]
Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.[48][49]

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.[50]
Political views[edit]
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."[36] He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence.[51] Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias.[9] He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[52]
In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush "quite reluctantly, incidentally."[53] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[52] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[54]
Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had "great ideas" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee.[55] On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich "1 million dollars" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a "quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist" and a possible foreign usurper,[56] in the 2012 election.[57]
Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[58] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[59]
Activism[edit]
Legal defense contributions[edit]
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[60] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[61] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[62] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.
In November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.[63]
Lieutenant Michael Behenna[edit]
Main article: Michael Behenna
On his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.[64]
Michael Savage Scholarship[edit]
In July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question "What Does It Mean to Be an American?" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.[65]
Awards and criticism[edit]
Awards[edit]
On June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.[66]
National Radio Hall of Fame
In 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left."[67] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation "is an act, a put-on."[51] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[47][68][69]
On April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?"[70] This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[71]
In the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[72] The assertion prompted criticism,[72] but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life.[73] A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call.[73] After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund.[73] The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days.[citation needed] Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.[72]
Catholic Church and Immigration[edit]
In March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").[74] Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology."[75]
On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.[76]
C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award[edit]
When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.[66] Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was "censorship" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[77]
Dispute with CAIR[edit]
In early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need deportation", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."[78] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.
On November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[79]
Savage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[80] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".[81] On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations."[82] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[83][84][85] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.[86]
Autism[edit]
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."[87] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

Now, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, "Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot."[88]

In July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[88][89] WOR issued a statement saying, "We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners."[87] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[90] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[91] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left Stalinists" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[87][92] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.[93]
Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[94]
Banned from entering the United Kingdom[edit]
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence".[95][96][97][98] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a "lunatic".[99]
During a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".[100] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."[101] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a "foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[100]
Of the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: "America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."[102] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."[103] While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."[71]
On July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.[104][105]
Veteran PTSD[edit]
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military."[106]
Personal life[edit]
While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[33] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.
Savage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[107] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[16] Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher.[27] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[27] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.[27][108][109]
During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley.[17] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[110] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: "... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't."[111]
Books[edit]
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times bestsellers and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list.[5][6][7] Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally[112] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.
His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS.[113] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[113]
His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.
In 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[114] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "reverse discrimination", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[115]
In January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gay activists, and liberals.
In January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.[citation needed]
In April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.
In October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."[116]
In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".[117]
In October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments "[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country." It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List[118] for six weeks.
In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[119]

Michael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), better known by his professional name Michael Savage,[1] is an American radio host, author, activist, nutritionist, and conservative political commentator. He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.[2][3] Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.[8]
Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism,[9] while critics have characterized them as "fostering extremism."[10] He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.
Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner[1] in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,[15] Jewish emigrants from Russia.[15][16][17][18] He described his childhood as difficult.[16] His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.[19] Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57[17] in 1970,[20] and his mother died in 2003.[15]
After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[21][22] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[17] After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself.[16] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[23][24] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[25] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[26]
Shift in political opinions[edit]
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s.[27] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a "calling card."[16][27] Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[16][28] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."[18] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[16]
Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[27] Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[27] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."[18] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[29] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[30] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic.[31] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[32] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.[27] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[33]
Career as commentator[edit]
Main article: The Savage Nation
Radio[edit]
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[27][34] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.
In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10 million listeners per week,[35] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein."[36] Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."[18]
By 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[2][3] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[17][37]
On September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles.[38] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."[39] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[40]
On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[30] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.
On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.[41] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[42] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[43] On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[44][45]
In January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[46]
MSNBC television show[edit]
Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"[28] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."[47]
Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.[48][49]

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.[50]
Political views[edit]
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."[36] He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence.[51] Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias.[9] He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[52]
In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush "quite reluctantly, incidentally."[53] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[52] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[54]
Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had "great ideas" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee.[55] On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich "1 million dollars" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a "quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist" and a possible foreign usurper,[56] in the 2012 election.[57]
Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[58] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[59]
Activism[edit]
Legal defense contributions[edit]
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[60] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[61] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[62] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.
In November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.[63]
Lieutenant Michael Behenna[edit]
Main article: Michael Behenna
On his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.[64]
Michael Savage Scholarship[edit]
In July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question "What Does It Mean to Be an American?" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.[65]
Awards and criticism[edit]
Awards[edit]
On June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.[66]
National Radio Hall of Fame
In 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left."[67] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation "is an act, a put-on."[51] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[47][68][69]
On April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?"[70] This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[71]
In the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[72] The assertion prompted criticism,[72] but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life.[73] A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call.[73] After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund.[73] The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days.[citation needed] Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.[72]
Catholic Church and Immigration[edit]
In March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").[74] Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology."[75]
On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.[76]
C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award[edit]
When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.[66] Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was "censorship" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[77]
Dispute with CAIR[edit]
In early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need deportation", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."[78] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.
On November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[79]
Savage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[80] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".[81] On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations."[82] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[83][84][85] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.[86]
Autism[edit]
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."[87] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

Now, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, "Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot."[88]

In July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[88][89] WOR issued a statement saying, "We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners."[87] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[90] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[91] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left Stalinists" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[87][92] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.[93]
Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[94]
Banned from entering the United Kingdom[edit]
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence".[95][96][97][98] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a "lunatic".[99]
During a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".[100] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."[101] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a "foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[100]
Of the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: "America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."[102] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."[103] While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."[71]
On July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.[104][105]
Veteran PTSD[edit]
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military."[106]
Personal life[edit]
While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[33] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.
Savage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[107] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[16] Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher.[27] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[27] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.[27][108][109]
During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley.[17] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[110] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: "... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't."[111]
Books[edit]
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times bestsellers and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list.[5][6][7] Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally[112] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.
His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS.[113] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[113]
His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.
In 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[114] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "reverse discrimination", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[115]
In January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gay activists, and liberals.
In January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.[citation needed]
In April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.
In October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."[116]
In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".[117]
In October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments "[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country." It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List[118] for six weeks.
In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[119]

Michael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), better known by his professional name Michael Savage,[1] is an American radio host, author, activist, nutritionist, and conservative political commentator. He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.[2][3] Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.[8]
Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism,[9] while critics have characterized them as "fostering extremism."[10] He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.
Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner[1] in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,[15] Jewish emigrants from Russia.[15][16][17][18] He described his childhood as difficult.[16] His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.[19] Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57[17] in 1970,[20] and his mother died in 2003.[15]
After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[21][22] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[17] After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself.[16] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[23][24] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[25] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[26]
Shift in political opinions[edit]
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s.[27] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a "calling card."[16][27] Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[16][28] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."[18] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[16]
Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[27] Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[27] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."[18] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[29] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[30] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic.[31] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[32] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.[27] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[33]
Career as commentator[edit]
Main article: The Savage Nation
Radio[edit]
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[27][34] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.
In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10 million listeners per week,[35] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein."[36] Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."[18]
By 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[2][3] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[17][37]
On September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles.[38] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."[39] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[40]
On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[30] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.
On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.[41] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[42] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[43] On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[44][45]
In January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[46]
MSNBC television show[edit]
Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"[28] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."[47]
Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.[48][49]

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.[50]
Political views[edit]
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."[36] He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence.[51] Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias.[9] He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[52]
In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush "quite reluctantly, incidentally."[53] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[52] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[54]
Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had "great ideas" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee.[55] On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich "1 million dollars" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a "quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist" and a possible foreign usurper,[56] in the 2012 election.[57]
Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[58] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[59]
Activism[edit]
Legal defense contributions[edit]
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[60] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[61] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[62] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.
In November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.[63]
Lieutenant Michael Behenna[edit]
Main article: Michael Behenna
On his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.[64]
Michael Savage Scholarship[edit]
In July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question "What Does It Mean to Be an American?" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.[65]
Awards and criticism[edit]
Awards[edit]
On June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.[66]
National Radio Hall of Fame
In 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left."[67] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation "is an act, a put-on."[51] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[47][68][69]
On April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?"[70] This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[71]
In the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[72] The assertion prompted criticism,[72] but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life.[73] A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call.[73] After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund.[73] The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days.[citation needed] Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.[72]
Catholic Church and Immigration[edit]
In March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").[74] Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology."[75]
On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.[76]
C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award[edit]
When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.[66] Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was "censorship" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[77]
Dispute with CAIR[edit]
In early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need deportation", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."[78] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.
On November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[79]
Savage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[80] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".[81] On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations."[82] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[83][84][85] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.[86]
Autism[edit]
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."[87] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

Now, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, "Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot."[88]

In July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[88][89] WOR issued a statement saying, "We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners."[87] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[90] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[91] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left Stalinists" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[87][92] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.[93]
Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[94]
Banned from entering the United Kingdom[edit]
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence".[95][96][97][98] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a "lunatic".[99]
During a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".[100] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."[101] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a "foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[100]
Of the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: "America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."[102] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."[103] While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."[71]
On July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.[104][105]
Veteran PTSD[edit]
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military."[106]
Personal life[edit]
While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[33] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.
Savage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[107] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[16] Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher.[27] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[27] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.[27][108][109]
During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley.[17] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[110] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: "... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't."[111]
Books[edit]
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times bestsellers and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list.[5][6][7] Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally[112] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.
His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS.[113] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[113]
His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.
In 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[114] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "reverse discrimination", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[115]
In January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gay activists, and liberals.
In January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.[citation needed]
In April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.
In October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."[116]
In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".[117]
In October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments "[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country." It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List[118] for six weeks.
In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[119]

Michael Alan Weiner (born March 31, 1942), better known by his professional name Michael Savage,[1] is an American radio host, author, activist, nutritionist, and conservative political commentator. He is the host of The Savage Nation, a nationally syndicated talk show that aired on Talk Radio Network across the United States until 2012, and in 2009 was the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.[2][3] Since October 23, 2012, Michael Savage has been syndicated by Cumulus Media Networks. He holds master's degrees from the University of Hawaii in medical botany and medical anthropology, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in nutritional ethnomedicine. As Michael Weiner, he has written books on nutrition, herbal medicine, and homeopathy; as Michael Savage, he has written four political books that have reached The New York Times Best Seller List.[8]
Savage has summarized his political philosophy in three words: borders, language, and culture. Savage has characterized his views as conservative nationalism,[9] while critics have characterized them as "fostering extremism."[10] He opposes illegal immigration to the United States, supports the English-only movement and argues that liberalism and progressivism are degrading American culture. Although his radio delivery is mainly characterized as politically themed, he also often covers topics such as medicine, nutrition, music, literature, history, theology, philosophy, sports, business, economics, and culture, and tells personal anecdotes.
Since 2009, Savage has been barred from entering the United Kingdom, for "seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred."[14]

Early life and education[edit]
Savage was born Michael Alan Weiner[1] in the Bronx, New York, one of three children of Benjamin and Rae Weiner,[15] Jewish emigrants from Russia.[15][16][17][18] He described his childhood as difficult.[16] His little brother, Jerome, was born with developmental disabilities and was unable to hear or speak.[19] Jerome died in 1969. His father, the owner of an antiques shop, died of a heart attack at age 57[17] in 1970,[20] and his mother died in 2003.[15]
After graduating from Jamaica High School in 1958,[21][22] Savage attended Queens College, where he earned a bachelor's degree in biology in 1963.[17] After college Savage taught high school for several years in New York City. His first marriage in 1964 to Carol Ely ended in divorce, and he remarried in 1967 after meeting his current wife, Janet. During this time Savage also worked for famous psychedelic drug advocate Timothy Leary as keeper of the stone gatehouse on the Hitchcock Cattle Company estate in Millbrook, New York, to which Leary had been given access. Leary hired him to the post because Savage did not use LSD himself.[16] Savage then studied at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, earning a Master of Science in botany in 1970 and a Master of Arts in anthropology in 1972.[23][24] He obtained a PhD in 1978 from the University of California, Berkeley, in nutritional ethnomedicine.[25] His thesis was titled Nutritional Ethnomedicine in Fiji.[26]
Shift in political opinions[edit]
Savage introduced himself to certain writers in the North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s.[27] He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz, also an acquaintance of Savage from this time, reported Savage possessed a photograph of himself and Ginsberg swimming naked in Hawaii and used the photograph as sort of a "calling card."[16][27] Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University.[16][28] One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could "hear and see and know why I adore your public image."[18] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.[16]
Acquaintance Robert Cathcart says that by 1980, in his private conversations with Savage, he knew him to have conservative political views.[27] Schwartz stated Savage became alienated from the North Beach scene in the early 1980s. Savage had intense arguments with his liberal friends.[27] When asked about his shift in politics and other views, Savage replied, "I was once a child; I am now a man."[18] Savage has cited many occurrences in his life that helped shape his conservative views. Savage states that his opinions on welfare were partly shaped by his first job out of college as a social worker.[29] He described one incident in which his supervisor had him deliver a check to a welfare client to furnish their apartment, while his own apartment was furnished with cardboard boxes.[30] Another turning point occurred for him as a writer of health and nutrition books in the 1980s, when he experienced what he saw as "political opposition" after making the suggestion that the closure of homosexual bathhouses might be necessary in response to the emerging AIDS epidemic.[31] In 1994 his final health and nutrition manuscript, Immigrants and Epidemics, was rejected by publishers for being inflammatory.[32] In 1996, Savage applied to become the Dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley. The University instead selected award-winning journalist and China scholar Orville Schell. Savage sued the University, contending discrimination for being conservative.[27] Savage later dropped the lawsuit.[33]
Career as commentator[edit]
Main article: The Savage Nation
Radio[edit]
The rejection by publishers of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage to record a demo tape with a mock radio talk show about the contents of the work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host.[27][34] On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host. At the time, his slogan was "To the right of Rush and to the left of God." On January 1, 1995, he was given his own show during the drive-time hours on sister station KSFO. The show quickly became a local hit. During his time at KSFO, Savage reached #1 in Arbitron ratings among both adult men and women over 18 during afternoon drive-time in San Francisco and became top talk host in his time-slot.
In mid 2006, Savage had 8–10 million listeners per week,[35] which made his show the third most widely heard broadcast in the United States at that time. Savage has described his listeners as "literate callers with intelligence, wit, and energy." He has described his show's production as one with a "... hard edge combined with humor and education ... Those who listen to me say they hear a bit of Plato, Henry Miller, Jack Kerouac, Moses, Jesus, and Frankenstein."[36] Mark de la Viña of the San Jose Mercury News wrote of Savage: "In contrast to Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity and Laura Schlessinger, Bay Area-based Savage mixes conservative diatribe and blunt observations with acerbic humor and the gift of gab."[18]
By 2009, The Savage Nation had an audience of 8 to 10 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States, making it the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country at the time.[2][3] Around that time, Savage asked his audience for their opinion prior to consenting to a profile interview by Kelefa Sanneh of The New Yorker; Savage eventually accepted that offer and the New Yorker profile, titled "Party of One", was published in the August 3, 2009, issue, which covered Savage's life and personality in great detail.[17][37]
On September 10, 2009, KNEW-AM (910 kHz) in Savage's home market of San Francisco announced that it was dropping his program and replacing him with John and Ken from sister station KFI-AM (640 kHz)/Los Angeles.[38] John Scott, program director of KNEW said in an e-mail that the station was headed "... in a different philosophical and ideological direction, featuring more contemporary content and more local information."[39] According to Arbitron monthly ratings, KNEW-AM dropped in the ratings since Savage was let go. San Francisco station KTRB picked up the program for the San Francisco market, and saw a ratings boost in the afternoon drive. However, the program was among the first casualties when KTRB went into receivership in September 2010.[40]
On January 22, 2010, Savage revealed to his audience that a writer for Playboy had contacted him via email to do a lengthy interview, and again asked his listeners if he should accept the offer. During the show, Savage read from personal emails between the Playboy writer and himself. The writer admitted to being a listener of the Savage Nation but a critic of the profile done by The New Yorker. The writer also stated that the purpose of the interview was to "rattle" Playboy's readers. On May 12, 2010, Savage revealed that he had granted the interview at his home. Playboy published the interview in June 2010.[30] He read from a pre-publication copy of the 8,000-word Playboy interview, in which the writer expressed animosity for Savage and his views. Savage said that he was disappointed at the lack of journalistic objectivity, but did not harbor hatred for the writer. He referred back to the New Yorker interview by Kelefa Sanneh, and praised Sanneh as a "real writer" who had understood his subject.
On September 27, 2012, Savage's talk show left the airwaves after he won a legal battle with Talk Radio Network, his longtime employer, and his attorney said discussions with new networks were under way.[41] Savage began an occasional series of video webcasts via Ustream on September 30, 2012. On October 17, 2012, Savage and his new syndicator Cumulus Media Networks announced that they had made a deal and the program, after several weeks off the air, would be returning as of October 23, 2012.[42] By April 2013, according to the radio industry's Talkers Magazine, Savage had 3.5+ million weekly listeners, putting him in a six-way tie for sixth place, and six talk show hosts getting 7.5+ million weekly listeners.[43] On September 26, 2013 Cumulus Media Networks announced that Michael Savage's radio show, The Savage Nation, would move to the 3p-6p ET time-slot beginning in January 2014. This time slot had been occupied by Sean Hannity.[44][45]
In January 2015, it was announced that Savage and Westwood One had reached agreement on a long-term contract renewal for The Savage Nation.[46]
MSNBC television show[edit]
Savage was hired by MSNBC president Erik Sorenson to do a one-hour show beginning March 8, 2003, despite Savage's previous criticism of the network in his book The Savage Nation and the objections of NBC employees including news anchor Tom Brokaw, who asked NBC executives, "Is this the sort of man who embodies the values of NBC?"[28] Sorenson, at the time, called Savage "brash, passionate and smart," and promised that he would provide "compelling opinion and analysis with an edge."[47]
Four months later, on July 7, Savage was fired from his MSNBC television show after remarks made in response to a caller, later identified as prank caller Bob Foster, who insulted Savage's teeth. Savage then asked if Foster was a "sodomite", to which the caller answered, "Yes, I am." Savage then said to the caller,

Oh, so you're one of those sodomites. You should only get AIDS and die, you pig; how's that? Why don't you see if you can sue me, you pig? You got nothing better to do than to put me down, you piece of garbage? You got nothing to do today? Go eat a sausage, and choke on it. Get trichinosis. Now do we have another nice caller here who's busy because he didn't have a nice night in the bathhouse who's angry at me today? Put another, put another sodomite on ... no more calls? ... I don't care about these bums; they mean nothing to me. They're all sausages.[48][49]

The day after being fired, Savage apologized on his radio program and on his website. He explained that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller and that he was off the air at the time of the offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult the caller, not all people with AIDS.[50]
Political views[edit]
Michael Savage calls himself an "independent-minded individualist" and says that he "fits no stereotype."[36] He has also cited Barry Goldwater as an influence.[51] Savage criticizes big government as well as liberalism and liberal activism, and accuses the mainstream news media of liberal bias.[9] He considers the three aspects that define a nation as borders, language, and culture; those aspects inspired the motto of the Paul Revere Society.[52]
In 2003, Savage said that he voted in 2000 for George W. Bush "quite reluctantly, incidentally."[53] In 2004, Savage and the Revere Society hosted a party at Schroeder's Cafe in San Francisco celebrating the re-election of Bush.[52] Savage donated $5,600 to the campaign of Democratic candidate Jerry Brown in the 2006 California Attorney General election.[54]
Regarding candidates for the 2012 Republican primaries, Savage said that Ron Paul had "great ideas" but expressed hope that Rick Perry would be the nominee.[55] On December 12, 2011, he offered Newt Gingrich "1 million dollars" to withdraw from the United States Presidential contest. He stated that only Mitt Romney had a chance to beat Barack Obama, a man he had previously described as a "quasi-pseudo-crypto Marxist" and a possible foreign usurper,[56] in the 2012 election.[57]
Savage strongly supported Donald Trump, a regular guest on his talk show, since Trump's June 2015 announcement of his candidacy in the United States 2016 presidential election.[58] Trump has claimed to be a listener and a fan of Savage's show, and an April 2016 Salon article described Savage as having been a major influence on Trump's campaign.[59]
Activism[edit]
Legal defense contributions[edit]
Savage has regularly donated money toward the legal defense of the Marines accused of murdering civilians in Haditha, Iraq; occasionally, Savage will offer proceeds from any sales through his website. Savage had regular contact with the attorneys of the accused and criticizes their treatment at Camp Pendleton.[60] Most recently, Savage has donated over $10,000 to the U.S. Marines Charity Defense Fund at the Thomas More Law Center[61] On April 25, 2007, he pledged $1 for each copy of Healing Children Naturally and Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's purchased from his website to be donated to the U.S. Marines Defense Fund.[62] The Marines were ultimately found not guilty.
In November 2014, Dr. Savage helped reunite a wounded soldier with his K-9 partner as well as donating money to purchase an SUV.[63]
Lieutenant Michael Behenna[edit]
Main article: Michael Behenna
On his nationally syndicated talk radio program, Michael Savage announced that he had sent another $50,000 to aid in the defense of First Lieutenant Michael Behenna, who has been sentenced to 15 years in prison for murdering alleged terrorist Ali Mansur Mohammed while serving in Iraq with the 101st Airborne Division in 2008. Savage has previously given $50,000 to Behenna's defense from the Savage Legal Defense Fund and his own personal contributions. According to Vicki Behenna, the lieutenant's mother, additional contributions from listeners since Savage brought up this topic on his program have amounted to over $40,000. This brings the total contributions from Savage and his listeners to nearly $150,000.[64]
Michael Savage Scholarship[edit]
In July 2015, Savage announced the five winners of his essay contest based on the question "What Does It Mean to Be an American?" The college students will each receive a $20,000 scholarship over a two-year period. The winners, announced on The Savage Nation radio show, were selected from approximately 1,700 entries. Savage launched the $100,000 scholarship fund in early 2015 with the intention of promoting traditional American values among conservative college students.[65]
Awards and criticism[edit]
Awards[edit]
On June 9, 2007, Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," and he accepted it with a pre-recorded speech.[66]
National Radio Hall of Fame
In 2016 Michael Savage was named as an inductee to the National Radio Hall of Fame in the category of Spoken Word On-Air Personality. He was selected over other nominees Sean Hannity, Diane Rehm and Mike Francesa. [1]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2005, former CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg ranked Savage as number 61 in his book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America. Goldberg wrote that "Savage's brand of over-the-top bile ... puts him right in there with the angriest haters of the Left."[67] David Klinghoffer, a National Review columnist, speculated that The Savage Nation "is an act, a put-on."[51] Various progressive advocacy groups such as GLAAD and FAIR accuse Savage of racism, homophobia, transphobia, and Islamophobia because of his controversial statements about homosexuality, Islam, feminism, sex education, and immigration.[47][68][69]
On April 17, 2006, he said on the topic of Muslims, "They say, 'Oh, there's a billion of them.' I said, 'So, kill 100 million of them, then there'll be 900 million of them.' I mean, would you rather die—would you rather us die than them?"[70] This was taken from an argument dealing with the possibility of a nuclear conflict in that region. This was repeated in the media after Savage was barred from entering the UK.[71]
In the wake of the actor Robin Williams' suicide, Savage said that suicide is an "aggressive act" that shows no consideration for loved ones left behind.[72] The assertion prompted criticism,[72] but a caller to The Savage Nation said the radio host's frank talk about the subject helped him decide to not take his own life.[73] A caller who identified himself as Joe told Savage he had been contemplating suicide for the past several months, and especially in the most recent week previous to the call.[73] After Savage discovered that Joe was suffering financially, he asked his audience to join in helping Joe get through the rest of the month by donating through the Savage Legal Defense Fund.[73] The Fund raised over $10,000 in just a few days.[citation needed] Another caller from Detroit had given Savage a jolt by referring to his days as a phone line crisis counselor as being predominantly dealing with suicide calls. The advice that the Detroit caller had given - "you are taking a permanent solution for a temporary problem" encouraged Savage to reach out to the suicidal caller he had.[72]
Catholic Church and Immigration[edit]
In March 2006, Savage criticised Roman Catholic assistance to illegal immigrants (in response to statements by Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles calling it "pastoral support").[74] Bill Donohue of the Catholic League canceled an appearance on the show, saying "what is not fine is Savage's diatribe about the 'greedy pigs' in the Catholic Church and how 'the institution is rotten from the top to the bottom.' He owes all Catholics an apology."[75]
On March 28, 2006, Savage encouraged his listeners to burn Mexican flags to counter pro-immigration rallies in California.[76]
C-SPAN broadcast of Talkers Award[edit]
When Talkers Magazine awarded Savage with the publication's annual "Freedom of Speech Award," C-SPAN opted not to broadcast a pre-recorded speech that had been sent by Savage.[66] Although the award ceremony had received coverage in previous years, C-SPAN did not televise it due to its policy of televising such speeches only when delivered in person. Savage stated that C-SPAN's decision was "censorship" and he told his listeners to express their ire to C-SPAN through calls and e-mails to the organization.[77]
Dispute with CAIR[edit]
In early November 2007, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) called on radio listeners to contact companies that advertise on Savage's program to express their concerns about his comments concerning Muslims. Savage was quoted as saying Muslims "need deportation", and that adherents of Islam would do well to "take your religion and shove it up your behind" because "I'm sick of you."[78] On his show and website, Savage answered by accusing CAIR of supporting Hamas.
On November 8, 2007, following a campaign by CAIR meant to get Savage off the air by alerting his sponsors to the nature of his comments, Citrix Systems, Inc. pulled its advertisements from his show.[79]
Savage sued CAIR for copyright infringement for using excerpts from his show on CAIR's website.[80] The suit alleged that CAIR's repackaging of Savage's comments was "deliberately designed to obscure the specific message conveyed by Michael Savage". The excerpts included Savage's characterization of the Qur'an as "a throwback document" and a "book of hate". CAIR called the suit "bizarre, sloppy and baseless".[81] On July 25, 2008, the United States district court dismissed Savage's suit against CAIR, holding that the posting of the audio clip was protected under the First Amendment doctrine of fair use, as it was used to "comment on and rebut derogatory statements regarding their organization and their religious affiliations."[82] The court gave Savage the opportunity to file an amended complaint if he wanted to try to cure the defects in his suit. That amended complaint alleged that CAIR was a RICO conspirator in support of terror, including the 9/11 terror attack on the World Trade Center. Permission was granted to allow that filing but on August 14, 2008, however, Savage's lawyer, Daniel Horowitz, announced that Savage would not file an amended complaint and would drop the case.[83][84][85] CAIR then sought attorneys fees against Savage but U.S. District Court judge Susan Illston denied that request.[86]
Autism[edit]
In July 2008, Savage said that the increasing rate of autism diagnoses was the result of "a racket" designed to get disability payments for "poorer families who have found a new way to be parasites on the government."[87] He returned to the subject on his July 16, 2008, show with the following remarks:

Now, the illness du jour is autism. You know what autism is? I'll tell you what autism is. In 99 percent of the cases, it's a brat who hasn't been told to cut the act out. That's what autism is. What do you mean they scream and they're silent? They don't have a father around to tell them, "Don't act like a moron. You'll get nowhere in life. Stop acting like a putz. Straighten up. Act like a man. Don't sit there crying and screaming, idiot."[88]

In July 2008 the progressive pressure group Media Matters for America picketed the studios of WOR in New York, along with parents of autistic children.[88][89] WOR issued a statement saying, "We regret any consternation that his remarks may have caused to our listeners."[87] Also that day, the insurance company Aflac pulled its advertising,[90] and the Supertalk Mississippi radio network dropped Savage's program, replacing it with The Dennis Miller Show.[91] Later that evening, Savage devoted his entire three-hour program to the subject, taking calls from parents who took issue with his comments. On that show Savage stated that his remarks had been "ripped out of context" by "far left Stalinists" who want him off of the air. He appeared on Larry King Live with Glenn Beck as the substitute host for Larry King, and said that the real issue he was commenting on was the overdiagnosis of children due to pharmaceutical companies' drive to drug children for higher profits.[87][92] On July 25, 2008, Autism United advocates gathered to announce that several advertisers, including RadioShack, Sears, Home Depot, and DirectBuy, will discontinue their support for Savage's show.[93]
Savage's syndicator, Talk Radio Network, has responded by releasing a lengthy statement, along with a selection of 20 audio clips drawn from Savage's discussions of autism, to show that the comments were taken out of context.[94]
Banned from entering the United Kingdom[edit]
On May 5, 2009, it was announced by then-Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that Savage was on a list of individuals banned from entering the United Kingdom as he is "considered to be engaging in unacceptable behaviour by seeking to provoke others to serious criminal acts and fostering hatred which might lead to inter-community violence".[95][96][97][98] During his radio broadcast on that same day, Savage declared that he would sue Smith personally for defamation, calling her a "lunatic".[99]
During a subsequent NPR talk show, Savage said that he has never advocated violence and repeatedly invoked the United States Constitution's First Amendment. After host Neal Conan pointed out that the U.S. Constitution does not apply to the United Kingdom, Savage replied, "No. Thank God I'm an American. But for this lunatic ... to link me up with Nazi skinheads who are killing people in Russia ... to put me in league with Hamas murderers who killed Jews on buses, is astonishing".[100] Savage also called on his listeners to support him by canceling travel and business in Britain as well as by boycotting British-made goods, commenting, "If they want to play hardball, we'll play hardball."[101] When a caller challenged Savage about his talk show rhetoric, Savage called him a "foaming lunatic ... someone in pajamas in a mental asylum ... You're nobody and I'm not going to talk to you!" At that point, Neal Conan invited him to leave.[100]
Of the banning, the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, wrote: "America still has a constitutional protection of free speech, and I have been amazed ... to see how few people in this country are willing to stick up for that elementary principle ... a country once famous for free speech is now hysterically and expensively sensitive to anything that could be taken as a slight."[102] In The Guardian, Catherine Bennett wrote: "The ban on Savage is so far from being a comprehensible act, so staggeringly capricious and stupid, as to defy evaluation."[103] While Sam Leith wrote: "Barring this shock-jock from Britain risks turning a rabid blabbermouth into a beacon for free speech."[71]
On July 12, 2010, the new Coalition government, of which the Conservative Party's David Cameron was Prime Minister, announced that it will continue to ban Savage from entering the UK.[104][105]
Veteran PTSD[edit]
On October 14, 2014, Savage criticized veteran sufferers of post traumatic stress disorder, accusing them of "weakness". According to Savage, "Everyone has depression in their life. But if the whole nation is told, 'boo-hoo-hoo, come and get a medication, come and get treatment, talk about mental illness.' You know what you wind up with? You wind up with Obama in the White House and liars in every phase of the government. That's what you wind up with. It's a weak, sick, nation. A weak, sick, broken nation. And you need men like me to save the country. You need men to stand up and say stop crying like a baby over everything ... No wonder we're being laughed at around the world. No wonder ISIS can defeat our military."[106]
Personal life[edit]
While in the South Pacific, he became fascinated with the 19th-century sailor Charles Savage, who was believed to have been the first man to bring firearms to Fiji.[33] That fascination led to Weiner's name change to Savage.
Savage and his second wife, Janet, have two children, a daughter and a son; his son, Russell Weiner, is the founder of the company that produces the Rockstar energy drink.[107] Russell's mother, Janet, served as CFO of his company until July 2009.[16] Daughter Rebecca Lin Yops has worked as an elementary school teacher.[27] In 1974, Savage and his family moved to Fairfax, California after Savage completed his master's degree at the University of Hawaii.[27] Savage has homes in Larkspur and Tiburon in Marin County, California, an apartment in San Francisco, as well as residences in Beverly Hills and West Palm Beach, Florida.[27][108][109]
During the 1980s, Savage attended Friday night services at a Chabad house in Berkeley.[17] In a 2003 interview on The O'Reilly Factor, Savage has said that although he believes in God, he attends houses of worship only once or twice a year.[110] In his 2012 book Trickle Down Tyranny, Savage wrote: "... I'm not religious. Do I believe in God? Sometimes I do, sometimes I don't."[111]
Books[edit]
In total, Savage has written 40 books, twenty under his real name of Michael Weiner, and twenty under his pseudonym of Michael Savage. As Michael Savage, his works include two #1 New York Times bestsellers and three additional books which made the New York Times bestseller list.[5][6][7] Two of his books as Michael Weiner, Reducing the Risk of Alzheimer's and Healing Children Naturally[112] have also been reprinted under his alias of Michael Savage.
His earlier books as Michael A. Weiner, Ph.D., are focused around his doctoral expertise in the field of nutritional ethnomedicine. In them, he advocates nutritional, herbal, and homeopathic options to approach the prevention and treatment of diseases such as poor diet, aging, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, allergies, cocaine addiction, the common cold, and AIDS.[113] He has also written about tree planting, beer-tasting, and nutritional cooking.[113]
His more recent books as Michael Savage are political in nature and published by a variety of different companies. His recent works also include holiday family stories and thrillers.
In 1991, Savage self-published The Death of the White Male, an argument against affirmative action, through Quantum Books.[114] In the book, Savage, calls affirmative action "reverse discrimination", and demonstrates his emerging philosophy. This eventually led to his starting the Paul Revere Society and he continues to sell the book to raise money for this group.[115]
In January 2003, Savage published The Savage Nation: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture, his first major book under the pseudonym Michael Savage. The book quickly reached the top of the New York Times Best Seller list, earning Savage, as noted above, a commentary show on MSNBC. The book directs attacks at "liberal media bias", the "dominating culture of 'she-ocracy'", gay activists, and liberals.
In January 2004, Savage published his second political book The Enemy Within: Saving America from the Liberal Assault on Our Schools, Faith, and Military. His next book, Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder, was released on April 12, 2005. Unlike The Savage Nation, both of these books cited sources for some of the more controversial claims made.[citation needed]
In April 2006, Savage released The Political Zoo. The book contains satirical profiles and cartoons of different public figures, most of whom are liberal political figures and celebrities, who are depicted in caricature as animals in the "Political Zoo", with Savage himself portrayed as the zoo keeper.
In October 2010, Savage released Trickle Up Poverty: Stopping Obama's Attack on Our Borders, Economy, and Security. Released through the HarperCollins imprint of William Morrow and Company, Savage argues in the book that "Americans are boiling mad over the way Congress and this Marxist/Leninist-oriented President are manipulating the current economic crisis to nationalize businesses."[116]
In November 2010, it was confirmed that Savage had signed a deal to write two thrillers for publisher St. Martin's Press. The first political thriller, Abuse of Power, was released on September 13, 2011. The novel is based on "My fictionalized account of being banned from Britain and hunted by overbearing governments is set in the San Francisco only I know", said Savage. It is set in San Francisco, mainly in North Beach, as well as London, and Tel Aviv. It tells the story of a failed carjacking that reveals a government cover-up. A dark plot involving British officials and a terrorist group known as "the Hand of Allah". The publisher has described the novel by saying, "will make 9/11 look like child's play".[117]
In October 2014, Savage released Stop the Coming Civil War, in which he comments "[The United States] is in real trouble and the seeds of a second conflagration have been sown. Not between the states - but between true patriots who believe in our nation's founding principles and those he believes are working every day to undermine them and change the very nature of the country." It was listed on the NY Times Bestseller List[118] for six weeks.
In March 2017, Savage released what he said would be his last political book, Trump's War: His Battle For America. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times Best Seller List.[119]

You don t have to live with depression.Everyone faces bad times and difficult situations. Why doesn t everyone getdepressed? Are there specific skills that you can develop that will protect youfrom depression and even prevent future episodes? The answer is yes. You canbreak the patterns of depression with the new perspectives and skills containedhere.Dr. Yapko contradicts the widely held belief that depression is a disease besttreated with medication or extensive psychotherapy. Successful and reliabletreatments for depression have been developed, and they provide a legitimatebasis for claiming that the majority of depression sufferers can be helped. In Breaking the Patterns of Depression, Dr. Yapko brings both twenty yearsof experience as a clinician and the most effective treatmentmethods--previously published only in professional circles--directly to thedepression sufferer.Depression is complex. The path to recovery can be created by learning to thinkrealistically about depression and how it affects you and why, and by activelyhoning the skills to change the thoughts, feelings, and behavior that adverselyaffect you. This book isn t emotional popcorn. It s a serious guide tobecoming and remaining depression-free.Have you ever felt so depressed that you had trouble concentrating on your job, talking with your family, even getting out of bed? Twenty to thirty millionAmericans suffer from some form of diagnosable depression, and their ranks aregrowing. Psychologist Michael D. Yapko explains that in order to find relief, more than the current episode of depression must be examined. In Breakingthe Patterns of Depression, he presents skills that will help youunderstand andultimately avert depression s recurring cycles. Focusing onfuture prevention as well as initial treatment, the book includes over onehundred activities to help you learn the skills necessary for becoming andremaining depression-free. Breaking the Patterns of Depression begins by translating the clinicalliterature on psychotherapy and antidepressant medication into language you canuse to enhance your understanding of depression and to personalize your cure.Using a conversational, anecdotal approach, Dr. Yapko encourages you to take anactive and experiential approach to helping yourself. Special activity sectionsentitled Learn by Doing and Shifting Perspectives help you to develop theskills necessary to manage difficult experiences. In this way, you will learnhow to solve problems effectively, anticipate the likely consequences of youractions, think and act in a direct and goal-oriented fashion, balance differentareas of your life, and use self-knowledge to stay out of hurtfulsituations.Realistic and enormously helpful, Breaking the Patterns of Depression allows you to recognize your triggers for depression and, best of all, toclarify what you can do about them. With this knowledge in hand, you cancontrol your depression rather than having your depression control you.Michael D. Yapko, Ph.D. is the author of seven previous books on brief, directive psychotherapy. He is a clinical psychologist in private practice inSolana Beach, California, and is known nationally and internationally for hiswork on treating depression with active, brief therapy methods. Acknowledginghis expertise, the Encyclopaedia Britannica commissioned Dr. Yapko to writesections on depression, clinicalhypnosis, and the repressed memory controversyfor their medical and health annuals. Dr. Yapko and his wife, Diane, enjoytraveling and hiking in their spare time. If depression has you in its grip, if your spirits need lifting, iftomorrow holds no promise of a better day, don t waste another minute: there san antidote to feeling lousy and it s this book, Breaking the Patterns ofDepression.

Item Description: Taylor & Francis Inc. Hardback. Book Condition: new. BRAND NEW, Chronic Pain: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Management, Michael Margoles, Richard S. Weiner, Chronic pain affects every aspect of life-physical well-being, mood, stamina, and feelings of self worth and self respect. This book focuses on conquering pain and its related problems through proper management. It offers numerous tools and concepts with which to attack chronic pain and win the battle that more than 35 million people in the U.S. alone fight every day. Virtually all specialists in the health care field must be concerned with pain management-this complete reference offers them strategies for helping their patients, and for patients to help themselves. Chronic Pain: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Management presents a variety of therapies for combating chronic pain, including: * Applying external therapy * Changing the way patients perceive pain through psychotherapy or other cognitive means * Physical therapy and exercises * Over-the-counter or prescription medicines to relieve pain, stress, and insomnia caused by discomfort * Surgical options The book also contains never before published information on how to prescribe and administer opioids and opioid-containing analgesics for chronic, intractable, and non-malignant pain patients. There is hope for those suffering from chronic pain. This book outlines commonly overlooked problems that, if properly addressed, can make the difference between a patient recovering or effectively managing their pain-or not. Chronic Pain: Assessment, Diagnosis, and Management is full of practical advice and options for anyone suffering from chronic pain and for the doctors who treat them.

Item Description: John Murray, 1934. Hardcover. Book Condition: Near Fine. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition. First edition. A NEAR FINE( a small inked "3cp" notation on the front free endpaper; trace of foxing to bottom page edges; spot of soil to top edges) book in just VERY GOOD- jacket. The thick though brittle jacket has separated ta front fold and spine fold. Archival tape has been used at spots to re-enforce the jacket, now in jacket protector. A SCARCE publication outlining Hitler's rise to power and before anyone truly realised what he planned for Germany under the Nazi Party. Many copies were recalled by the publsher after a lawsuit, for libel, had been initiated by an English doctor mentioned in the publication. Of the few copies held by libraries worldwide, most are proofs in wraps. One hardcover copy in jacket is held by the Weiner Library in London and another signed copy in jacket is in a private collection in Canada. Chapters on "The Jewish Question" & "Organized Immorality". Biographical sketches of principals in the Nazi regime are in included. Along with Hitler , others, mentioned along with their "nicknames" are Hermann ( Blood & Thunder) Goring; Dr Joseph ( Mickey Mouse) Goebbels, and Rudolph Hess ! The author finishes with a prophetic paragraph," Whatever the outcome of the conflict between a decayed Liberalism and a vigorous National Socialism, the luminous fact remains that the future of the entire civilised world is indissolubly merged with the future of the Third Gerrman empire." Little did he know! UNCOMMON in jacket.  Bookseller Inventory # JD3961

Anthony David Weiner (/ˈwiːnər/;[1] born September 4, 1964) is a former American politician. As a congressman, he represented New York's 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011. He won seven terms as a Democrat, never receiving less than 59% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after the first of several sexting scandals became public. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty in federal court to transferring obscene material to an underage girl.[2][3]
A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools, and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998, and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.

Early life, education, and family[edit]
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, as the middle son of his Jewish parents: Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.[4][5][6] The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. His older brother, Seth, was killed at age 39 by a hit-and-run driver on May 20, 2000.[7][8] His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.[9]
Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981.[10] He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,[11] and spent his junior year as an exchange student at The College of William and Mary where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart;[12] Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun of him during the sexting scandal in 2011.[13] His interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.[8]
Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.[14]
New York City Council[edit]
After working six years for Schumer, Weiner's first chance at political office came in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.[15] Considered a long-shot, Weiner faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.[5][15] Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by less than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "Hymietown", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.[16][17][18]
Weiner won the November general election, widely considered a formality, with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. At the time, he became the youngest councilman in the city's history, at age 27.[5][15] Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.[5][19]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
Weiner ran for Congress in 1998 from New York's 9th congressional district, the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district which included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.[20][21]
Domestic issues[edit]

He received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, indicating a strong pro-choice voting record.[22] He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the health reform bill, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.[23]
In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus.[24] Weiner received an "A" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[25] In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.[26] He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.[28][29] He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,[30] private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.[31] In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.[32]
When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, he said it would help towards reducing costs, and set up a website to push for the option.[31] He attracted wide attention when described the Republican Party as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry",[33] and proclaimed in front of Congress in February 2010 that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."[34]
Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,[35][36] which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal felony, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."[36]
On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.[37]
In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.[38] Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.[39]
Foreign policy[edit]
Weiner voted for the authorization to use force against Iraq in 2002.[40] In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar entry by the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.[41]
On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.[42]
Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "hatred of Christians and Jews" to its schoolchildren.[43]
Criticisms and controversies[edit]
In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses, describing him as often working long hours with his staff, requiring them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry, frequently yelling at them, and occasionally throwing office furniture in anger. As a result, according to the Times, he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress, including, at one point, three chiefs of staff in 18 months. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.[44]
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress which had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.[45][46] On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.[47] Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
Sexting scandals[edit]
Main article: Anthony Weiner sexting scandals
On May 27, 2011, Weiner sent a link of a sexually explicit photograph of himself via his public Twitter account[48][49][50] to a woman who was following him on Twitter.[51] After several days of denying he had posted the image,[52][53][54][55] Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.[56][57][58] After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show,[59] Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,[60][61][62][63] and he formally did so on June 21.[64] In the special election held on September 13, 2011, to replace him, Republican businessman Bob Turner[65] defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat.[66]
A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.[67] Explicit photos were sent by him under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom Weiner had contact as late as April 2013, more than a year after he had left Congress.[67] The 22-year-old woman was later revealed as Sydney Leathers, an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors.[68]
On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending one picture while lying in bed with his young son.[69] The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention to separate from her husband by stating, "After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy."[70]
On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.[71][72][73] The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election.[74] Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.[75]
On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing bringing child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident.[76][77] On May 19, 2017, the New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, intending to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor under a plea agreement.[78] Under the agreement, Weiner faces a sentence of 21 to 27 months, and will be required to register as a sex offender. His sentencing is scheduled for September 8, 2017.[79]
New York mayoral elections[edit]
Main articles: New York City mayoral election, 2005 and New York City mayoral election, 2013
2005[edit]
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.[4] He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.[4] One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".[4]
Weiner started out last in many polls,[4] but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.[citation needed]
2009[edit]
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.[80] However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent.[81] By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls.[82] According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.[83]
2013[edit]
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to "ask people to give me a second chance" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, "it's now or maybe never for me."[84]
In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York.[85] Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.[86]
Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in "Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class".[87]
On July 23, 2013, following the second set of sexting allegations that Weiner (using the alias "Carlos Danger") had continued to send explicitly photographs after his resignation from Congress, he acknowledged that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”.[88] Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign.[89][90][91] At the press conference, Weiner said, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”[92]
On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.[93] On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.[94]
Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work[edit]
Less than a month after leaving Congress, Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates in July 2011, where he advised over a dozen companies including electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms, and worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. His work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000 in 2012, according to public disclosures. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying.[95] This was based on the so-called "Daschle Loophole" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.[96]
Weiner was criticized by some on both the political left and right for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, "You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it." Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist.[97]
He was also criticized by the Sunlight Foundation for stealth lobbying, and falling under the aforementioned "Daschle Loophole", as the public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later when his nondisclosure agreements expired.[98]
In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors.[99][100]
By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating "It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony".[101] According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email.[100]
On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.[102]
Personal life[edit]




Huma Abedin, October 2010


Weiner is Jewish.[103][104] He is a lifelong fan of both the New York Mets and New York Islanders.[105]
In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.[106][107] In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.[108]
In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner.[70] In the spring of 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son, Jordan. On May 19, 2017, she filed for divorce. [109]
In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA.[110]
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[111]
Play[edit]
In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal.[112]
Television[edit]
In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.[113]

Health Affairs. 26 (1): 142–53. PMID 17211023. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.26.1.142. In 2005, U.S. health care spending increased 6.9 percent to almost $2.0 trillion, or $6,697 per person. The health care portion of gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.0 percent, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004. This third consecutive year of slower health spending growth was largely driven by prescription drug expenditures. Spending for hospital and physician and clinical services grew at similar rates as they did in 2004.

Anthony David Weiner (/ˈwiːnər/;[1] born September 4, 1964) is a former American politician. As a congressman, he represented New York's 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011. He won seven terms as a Democrat, never receiving less than 59% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after the first of several sexting scandals became public. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty in federal court to transferring obscene material to an underage girl.[2][3]
A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools, and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998, and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.

Early life, education, and family[edit]
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, as the middle son of his Jewish parents: Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.[4][5][6] The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. His older brother, Seth, was killed at age 39 by a hit-and-run driver on May 20, 2000.[7][8] His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.[9]
Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981.[10] He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,[11] and spent his junior year as an exchange student at The College of William and Mary where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart;[12] Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun of him during the sexting scandal in 2011.[13] His interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.[8]
Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.[14]
New York City Council[edit]
After working six years for Schumer, Weiner's first chance at political office came in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.[15] Considered a long-shot, Weiner faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.[5][15] Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by less than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "Hymietown", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.[16][17][18]
Weiner won the November general election, widely considered a formality, with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. At the time, he became the youngest councilman in the city's history, at age 27.[5][15] Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.[5][19]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
Weiner ran for Congress in 1998 from New York's 9th congressional district, the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district which included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.[20][21]
Domestic issues[edit]

He received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, indicating a strong pro-choice voting record.[22] He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the health reform bill, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.[23]
In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus.[24] Weiner received an "A" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[25] In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.[26] He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.[28][29] He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,[30] private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.[31] In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.[32]
When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, he said it would help towards reducing costs, and set up a website to push for the option.[31] He attracted wide attention when described the Republican Party as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry",[33] and proclaimed in front of Congress in February 2010 that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."[34]
Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,[35][36] which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal felony, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."[36]
On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.[37]
In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.[38] Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.[39]
Foreign policy[edit]
Weiner voted for the authorization to use force against Iraq in 2002.[40] In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar entry by the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.[41]
On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.[42]
Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "hatred of Christians and Jews" to its schoolchildren.[43]
Criticisms and controversies[edit]
In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses, describing him as often working long hours with his staff, requiring them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry, frequently yelling at them, and occasionally throwing office furniture in anger. As a result, according to the Times, he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress, including, at one point, three chiefs of staff in 18 months. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.[44]
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress which had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.[45][46] On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.[47] Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
Sexting scandals[edit]
Main article: Anthony Weiner sexting scandals
On May 27, 2011, Weiner sent a link of a sexually explicit photograph of himself via his public Twitter account[48][49][50] to a woman who was following him on Twitter.[51] After several days of denying he had posted the image,[52][53][54][55] Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.[56][57][58] After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show,[59] Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,[60][61][62][63] and he formally did so on June 21.[64] In the special election held on September 13, 2011, to replace him, Republican businessman Bob Turner[65] defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat.[66]
A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.[67] Explicit photos were sent by him under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom Weiner had contact as late as April 2013, more than a year after he had left Congress.[67] The 22-year-old woman was later revealed as Sydney Leathers, an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors.[68]
On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending one picture while lying in bed with his young son.[69] The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention to separate from her husband by stating, "After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy."[70]
On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.[71][72][73] The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election.[74] Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.[75]
On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing bringing child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident.[76][77] On May 19, 2017, the New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, intending to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor under a plea agreement.[78] Under the agreement, Weiner faces a sentence of 21 to 27 months, and will be required to register as a sex offender. His sentencing is scheduled for September 8, 2017.[79]
New York mayoral elections[edit]
Main articles: New York City mayoral election, 2005 and New York City mayoral election, 2013
2005[edit]
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.[4] He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.[4] One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".[4]
Weiner started out last in many polls,[4] but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.[citation needed]
2009[edit]
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.[80] However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent.[81] By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls.[82] According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.[83]
2013[edit]
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to "ask people to give me a second chance" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, "it's now or maybe never for me."[84]
In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York.[85] Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.[86]
Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in "Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class".[87]
On July 23, 2013, following the second set of sexting allegations that Weiner (using the alias "Carlos Danger") had continued to send explicitly photographs after his resignation from Congress, he acknowledged that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”.[88] Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign.[89][90][91] At the press conference, Weiner said, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”[92]
On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.[93] On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.[94]
Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work[edit]
Less than a month after leaving Congress, Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates in July 2011, where he advised over a dozen companies including electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms, and worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. His work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000 in 2012, according to public disclosures. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying.[95] This was based on the so-called "Daschle Loophole" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.[96]
Weiner was criticized by some on both the political left and right for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, "You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it." Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist.[97]
He was also criticized by the Sunlight Foundation for stealth lobbying, and falling under the aforementioned "Daschle Loophole", as the public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later when his nondisclosure agreements expired.[98]
In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors.[99][100]
By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating "It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony".[101] According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email.[100]
On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.[102]
Personal life[edit]




Huma Abedin, October 2010


Weiner is Jewish.[103][104] He is a lifelong fan of both the New York Mets and New York Islanders.[105]
In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.[106][107] In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.[108]
In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner.[70] In the spring of 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son, Jordan. On May 19, 2017, she filed for divorce. [109]
In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA.[110]
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[111]
Play[edit]
In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal.[112]
Television[edit]
In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.[113]

The health care portion of gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.0 percent, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004. This third consecutive year of slower health spending growth was largely driven by prescription drug expenditures.

Anthony David Weiner (/ˈwiːnər/;[1] born September 4, 1964) is a former American politician. As a congressman, he represented New York's 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011. He won seven terms as a Democrat, never receiving less than 59% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after the first of several sexting scandals became public. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty in federal court to transferring obscene material to an underage girl.[2][3]
A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools, and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998, and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.

Early life, education, and family[edit]
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, as the middle son of his Jewish parents: Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.[4][5][6] The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. His older brother, Seth, was killed at age 39 by a hit-and-run driver on May 20, 2000.[7][8] His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.[9]
Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981.[10] He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,[11] and spent his junior year as an exchange student at The College of William and Mary where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart;[12] Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun of him during the sexting scandal in 2011.[13] His interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.[8]
Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.[14]
New York City Council[edit]
After working six years for Schumer, Weiner's first chance at political office came in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.[15] Considered a long-shot, Weiner faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.[5][15] Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by less than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "Hymietown", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.[16][17][18]
Weiner won the November general election, widely considered a formality, with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. At the time, he became the youngest councilman in the city's history, at age 27.[5][15] Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.[5][19]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
Weiner ran for Congress in 1998 from New York's 9th congressional district, the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district which included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.[20][21]
Domestic issues[edit]

He received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, indicating a strong pro-choice voting record.[22] He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the health reform bill, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.[23]
In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus.[24] Weiner received an "A" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[25] In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.[26] He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.[28][29] He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,[30] private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.[31] In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.[32]
When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, he said it would help towards reducing costs, and set up a website to push for the option.[31] He attracted wide attention when described the Republican Party as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry",[33] and proclaimed in front of Congress in February 2010 that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."[34]
Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,[35][36] which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal felony, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."[36]
On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.[37]
In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.[38] Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.[39]
Foreign policy[edit]
Weiner voted for the authorization to use force against Iraq in 2002.[40] In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar entry by the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.[41]
On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.[42]
Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "hatred of Christians and Jews" to its schoolchildren.[43]
Criticisms and controversies[edit]
In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses, describing him as often working long hours with his staff, requiring them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry, frequently yelling at them, and occasionally throwing office furniture in anger. As a result, according to the Times, he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress, including, at one point, three chiefs of staff in 18 months. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.[44]
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress which had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.[45][46] On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.[47] Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
Sexting scandals[edit]
Main article: Anthony Weiner sexting scandals
On May 27, 2011, Weiner sent a link of a sexually explicit photograph of himself via his public Twitter account[48][49][50] to a woman who was following him on Twitter.[51] After several days of denying he had posted the image,[52][53][54][55] Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.[56][57][58] After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show,[59] Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,[60][61][62][63] and he formally did so on June 21.[64] In the special election held on September 13, 2011, to replace him, Republican businessman Bob Turner[65] defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat.[66]
A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.[67] Explicit photos were sent by him under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom Weiner had contact as late as April 2013, more than a year after he had left Congress.[67] The 22-year-old woman was later revealed as Sydney Leathers, an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors.[68]
On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending one picture while lying in bed with his young son.[69] The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention to separate from her husband by stating, "After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy."[70]
On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.[71][72][73] The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election.[74] Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.[75]
On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing bringing child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident.[76][77] On May 19, 2017, the New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, intending to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor under a plea agreement.[78] Under the agreement, Weiner faces a sentence of 21 to 27 months, and will be required to register as a sex offender. His sentencing is scheduled for September 8, 2017.[79]
New York mayoral elections[edit]
Main articles: New York City mayoral election, 2005 and New York City mayoral election, 2013
2005[edit]
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.[4] He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.[4] One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".[4]
Weiner started out last in many polls,[4] but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.[citation needed]
2009[edit]
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.[80] However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent.[81] By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls.[82] According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.[83]
2013[edit]
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to "ask people to give me a second chance" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, "it's now or maybe never for me."[84]
In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York.[85] Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.[86]
Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in "Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class".[87]
On July 23, 2013, following the second set of sexting allegations that Weiner (using the alias "Carlos Danger") had continued to send explicitly photographs after his resignation from Congress, he acknowledged that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”.[88] Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign.[89][90][91] At the press conference, Weiner said, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”[92]
On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.[93] On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.[94]
Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work[edit]
Less than a month after leaving Congress, Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates in July 2011, where he advised over a dozen companies including electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms, and worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. His work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000 in 2012, according to public disclosures. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying.[95] This was based on the so-called "Daschle Loophole" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.[96]
Weiner was criticized by some on both the political left and right for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, "You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it." Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist.[97]
He was also criticized by the Sunlight Foundation for stealth lobbying, and falling under the aforementioned "Daschle Loophole", as the public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later when his nondisclosure agreements expired.[98]
In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors.[99][100]
By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating "It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony".[101] According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email.[100]
On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.[102]
Personal life[edit]




Huma Abedin, October 2010


Weiner is Jewish.[103][104] He is a lifelong fan of both the New York Mets and New York Islanders.[105]
In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.[106][107] In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.[108]
In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner.[70] In the spring of 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son, Jordan. On May 19, 2017, she filed for divorce. [109]
In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA.[110]
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[111]
Play[edit]
In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal.[112]
Television[edit]
In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.[113]

Health Affairs. 26 (1): 142–53. PMID 17211023. doi:10.1377/hlthaff.26.1.142. In 2005, U.S. health care spending increased 6.9 percent to almost $2.0 trillion, or $6,697 per person. The health care portion of gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.0 percent, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004. This third consecutive year of slower health spending growth was largely driven by prescription drug expenditures. Spending for hospital and physician and clinical services grew at similar rates as they did in 2004.

Anthony David Weiner (/ˈwiːnər/;[1] born September 4, 1964) is a former American politician. As a congressman, he represented New York's 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011. He won seven terms as a Democrat, never receiving less than 59% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after the first of several sexting scandals became public. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty in federal court to transferring obscene material to an underage girl.[2][3]
A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools, and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998, and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.

Early life, education, and family[edit]
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, as the middle son of his Jewish parents: Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.[4][5][6] The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. His older brother, Seth, was killed at age 39 by a hit-and-run driver on May 20, 2000.[7][8] His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.[9]
Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981.[10] He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,[11] and spent his junior year as an exchange student at The College of William and Mary where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart;[12] Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun of him during the sexting scandal in 2011.[13] His interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.[8]
Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.[14]
New York City Council[edit]
After working six years for Schumer, Weiner's first chance at political office came in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.[15] Considered a long-shot, Weiner faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.[5][15] Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by less than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "Hymietown", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.[16][17][18]
Weiner won the November general election, widely considered a formality, with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. At the time, he became the youngest councilman in the city's history, at age 27.[5][15] Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.[5][19]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
Weiner ran for Congress in 1998 from New York's 9th congressional district, the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district which included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.[20][21]
Domestic issues[edit]

He received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, indicating a strong pro-choice voting record.[22] He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the health reform bill, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.[23]
In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus.[24] Weiner received an "A" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[25] In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.[26] He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.[28][29] He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,[30] private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.[31] In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.[32]
When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, he said it would help towards reducing costs, and set up a website to push for the option.[31] He attracted wide attention when described the Republican Party as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry",[33] and proclaimed in front of Congress in February 2010 that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."[34]
Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,[35][36] which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal felony, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."[36]
On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.[37]
In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.[38] Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.[39]
Foreign policy[edit]
Weiner voted for the authorization to use force against Iraq in 2002.[40] In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar entry by the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.[41]
On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.[42]
Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "hatred of Christians and Jews" to its schoolchildren.[43]
Criticisms and controversies[edit]
In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses, describing him as often working long hours with his staff, requiring them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry, frequently yelling at them, and occasionally throwing office furniture in anger. As a result, according to the Times, he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress, including, at one point, three chiefs of staff in 18 months. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.[44]
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress which had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.[45][46] On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.[47] Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]

On May 27, 2011, Weiner sent a link of a sexually explicit photograph of himself via his public Twitter account[48][49][50] to a woman who was following him on Twitter.[51] After several days of denying he had posted the image,[52][53][54][55] Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.[56][57][58] After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show,[59] Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,[60][61][62][63] and he formally did so on June 21.[64] In the special election held on September 13, 2011, to replace him, Republican businessman Bob Turner[65] defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat.[66]
A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.[67] Explicit photos were sent by him under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom Weiner had contact as late as April 2013, more than a year after he had left Congress.[67] The 22-year-old woman was later revealed as Sydney Leathers, an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors.[68]
On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending one picture while lying in bed with his young son.[69] The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention to separate from her husband by stating, "After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy."[70]
On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.[71][72][73] The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election.[74] Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.[75]
On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing bringing child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident.[76][77] On May 19, 2017, the New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, intending to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor under a plea agreement.[78] Under the agreement, Weiner faces a sentence of 21 to 27 months, and will be required to register as a sex offender. His sentencing is scheduled for September 8, 2017.[79]
New York mayoral elections[edit]
Main articles: New York City mayoral election, 2005 and New York City mayoral election, 2013
2005[edit]
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.[4] He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.[4] One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".[4]
Weiner started out last in many polls,[4] but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.[citation needed]
2009[edit]
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.[80] However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent.[81] By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls.[82] According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.[83]
2013[edit]
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to "ask people to give me a second chance" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, "it's now or maybe never for me."[84]
In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York.[85] Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.[86]
Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in "Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class".[87]
On July 23, 2013, following the second set of sexting allegations that Weiner (using the alias "Carlos Danger") had continued to send explicitly photographs after his resignation from Congress, he acknowledged that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”.[88] Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign.[89][90][91] At the press conference, Weiner said, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”[92]
On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.[93] On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.[94]
Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work[edit]
Less than a month after leaving Congress, Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates in July 2011, where he advised over a dozen companies including electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms, and worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. His work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000 in 2012, according to public disclosures. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying.[95] This was based on the so-called "Daschle Loophole" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.[96]
Weiner was criticized by some on both the political left and right for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, "You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it." Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist.[97]
He was also criticized by the Sunlight Foundation for stealth lobbying, and falling under the aforementioned "Daschle Loophole", as the public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later when his nondisclosure agreements expired.[98]
In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors.[99][100]
By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating "It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony".[101] According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email.[100]
On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.[102]
Personal life[edit]




Huma Abedin, October 2010


Weiner is Jewish.[103][104] He is a lifelong fan of both the New York Mets and New York Islanders.[105]
In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.[106][107] In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.[108]
In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner.[70] In the spring of 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son, Jordan. On May 19, 2017, she filed for divorce. [109]
In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA.[110]
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[111]
Play[edit]
In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal.[112]

In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.[113]

The health care portion of gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.0 percent, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004. This third consecutive year of slower health spending growth was largely driven by prescription drug expenditures. Spending for hospital and physician and clinical services grew at similar rates as they did in 2004.

Anthony David Weiner (/ˈwiːnər/;[1] born September 4, 1964) is a former American politician. As a congressman, he represented New York's 9th congressional district from January 1999 until June 2011. He won seven terms as a Democrat, never receiving less than 59% of the vote. Weiner resigned from Congress in June 2011 after the first of several sexting scandals became public. On May 19, 2017, Weiner pled guilty in federal court to transferring obscene material to an underage girl.[2][3]
A New York City native, Weiner attended public schools, and graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh in 1985 with a B.A. in political science. He was a member of the New York City Council from 1992 to 1998, and a congressional aide to U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer from 1985 to 1991. He was an unsuccessful candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2005 and 2013 New York City mayoral elections.

Early life, education, and family[edit]
Weiner was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn, as the middle son of his Jewish parents: Mort Weiner, a lawyer, and his wife Frances (née Finkelstein), a public high school math teacher.[4][5][6] The family lived for a time in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn. His older brother, Seth, was killed at age 39 by a hit-and-run driver on May 20, 2000.[7][8] His younger brother, Jason, is a chef and co-owner of several New York restaurants.[9]
Weiner took the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test, an examination used to determine admission to all but one of New York City's specialized high schools, and was admitted to Brooklyn Technical High School, from which he graduated in 1981.[10] He attended the State University of New York at Plattsburgh,[11] and spent his junior year as an exchange student at The College of William and Mary where he was friends with future comic and political commentator Jon Stewart;[12] Stewart acknowledged the friendship when he poked fun of him during the sexting scandal in 2011.[13] His interests turned towards politics; he became active in student government and was named most effective student senator.[8]
Upon receiving his Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1985, Weiner joined the staff of then–United States Representative and current Senator Charles Schumer. He worked in Schumer's Washington, D.C. office for three years, then transferred to the district office in Brooklyn in 1988, when Schumer encouraged him to become involved in local politics.[14]
New York City Council[edit]
After working six years for Schumer, Weiner's first chance at political office came in 1991 when the New York City Council was expanded from 35 to 51 seats.[15] Considered a long-shot, Weiner faced strong competition in the Democratic primary elections from two other candidates who had better local name recognition and funding.[5][15] Weiner narrowly won the primary, besting Adele Cohen by less than 200 votes. Controversy ensued in the last weeks of the campaign after Weiner's campaign anonymously spread leaflets around the district which had alleged ties between Cohen and the so-called "Jackson-Dinkins agenda"; the leaflets referred to the Crown Heights riots earlier in the year, after which white residents had seen Jesse Jackson, who became notorious for his earlier remarks about New York City as "Hymietown", and then-mayor David Dinkins as having been beholden to the predominantly African-American rioters and therefore endangering whites.[16][17][18]
Weiner won the November general election, widely considered a formality, with no opposition in the heavily Democratic district. At the time, he became the youngest councilman in the city's history, at age 27.[5][15] Over the next seven years on the City Council, Weiner initiated programs to address quality of life concerns. He also started a program to put at-risk and troubled teens to work cleaning up graffiti, and backed development plans that helped revive the historic Sheepshead Bay area.[5][19]
U.S. House of Representatives[edit]
Elections[edit]
Weiner ran for Congress in 1998 from New York's 9th congressional district, the seat held by his mentor, Chuck Schumer, who was running for the U.S. Senate. Weiner won the Democratic primary election, tantamount to election in the heavily Democratic district which included parts of southern Brooklyn and south and central Queens.[20][21]
Domestic issues[edit]

He received a 100% rating from the NARAL Pro-Choice America in 2003 and a 0% rating from National Right to Life Committee 2006, indicating a strong pro-choice voting record.[22] He was critical of the 2009 Stupak-Pitts Amendment to the health reform bill, calling it "unnecessary and divisive" and saying it would prevent health insurers from offering abortion coverage regardless of whether an individual uses federal funds to purchase an insurance plan.[23]
In April 2008, Weiner created the bi-partisan Congressional Middle Class Caucus.[24] Weiner received an "A" on the Drum Major Institute's 2005 Congressional Scorecard on middle-class issues.[25] In June 2008, Weiner sponsored a bill to increase the number of O-visas available to foreign fashion models, arguing that it would help boost the fashion industry in New York City.[26] He criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
During the health care reform debates of 2009, Weiner advocated for a bill called the United States National Health Care Act, which would have expanded Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.[28][29] He remarked that while 4% of Medicare funds go to overhead,[30] private insurers put 30% of their customer's money into profits and overhead instead of into health care.[31] In late July 2009, he secured a full House floor vote for single payer health care in exchange for not amending America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009 in committee mark-up with a single-payer plan.[32]
When a public health insurance option was being considered as part of America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, he said it would help towards reducing costs, and set up a website to push for the option.[31] He attracted wide attention when described the Republican Party as "a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry, teaming up with a small group of Democrats to try to protect that industry",[33] and proclaimed in front of Congress in February 2010 that "every single Republican I have ever met in my entire life is a wholly owned subsidiary of the insurance industry."[34]
Weiner was the chief sponsor of the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act of 2009,[35][36] which made the selling of tobacco in violation of any state tax law a federal felony, and effectively ended Internet tobacco smuggling by stopping shipments of cigarettes through the United States Postal Service. He claimed, "This new law will give states and localities a major revenue boost by cracking down on the illegal sale of tobacco", and added that "Every day we delay is another day that New York loses significant amounts of tax revenue and kids have easy access to tobacco products sold over the Internet."[36]
On July 29, 2010, Weiner criticized Republicans for opposing the 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, which would provide for funds for sick first responders to the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center. In a speech on the floor of the House, he accused Republicans of hiding behind procedural questions as an excuse to vote against the bill.[37]
In response to pressure from Weiner, YouTube removed some of Anwar al-Awlaki's inflammatory videos from its website in November 2010.[38] Weiner voted against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010. As a prominent Democratic opponent of the tax cut package passed by Congress, Weiner said Republicans had gotten the better of President Obama in the negotiations to reach an agreement on the $858 billion deal and said the Republicans turned out to be "better poker players" than Obama.[39]
Foreign policy[edit]
Weiner voted for the authorization to use force against Iraq in 2002.[40] In May 2006, Weiner attempted to bar entry by the Palestinian delegation to the United Nations. He added that the delegation "should start packing their little Palestinian terrorist bags", and went on to claim that Human Rights Watch, The New York Times, and Amnesty International are all biased against Israel.[41]
On July 29, 2007, Weiner and Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) objected to a $20-billion arms deal that the Bush Administration had negotiated with Saudi Arabia because they didn't want to provide "sophisticated weapons to a country that they believe has not done enough to stop terrorism", noting that 15 of the 19 hijackers of September 11, 2001, were Saudis. Weiner made the announcement outside of the Saudi Arabian consulate in Washington, stating, "We need to send a crystal clear message to the Saudi Arabian government that their tacit approval of terrorism can't go unpunished." The two intended to use a provision of the Arms Export Control Act to review the deal and pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval.[42]
Weiner and several other members of Congress later criticized the Obama administration proposal to sell over $60 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia. He said: "Saudi Arabia is not deserving of our aid, and by arming them with advanced American weaponry we are sending the wrong message", and described Saudi Arabia as having a "history of financing terrorism" and teaching "hatred of Christians and Jews" to its schoolchildren.[43]
Criticisms and controversies[edit]
In July 2008, The New York Times characterized Weiner as one of the most intense and demanding of bosses, describing him as often working long hours with his staff, requiring them to be in constant contact via BlackBerry, frequently yelling at them, and occasionally throwing office furniture in anger. As a result, according to the Times, he had one of the highest staff turnover rates of any member of Congress, including, at one point, three chiefs of staff in 18 months. Weiner admitted he pushed his aides hard but said his speaking at a high decibel level was part of his background and style, not necessarily shouting. Though some former employees were critical of his supervisory practices, others praised him for his intense involvement in constituent concerns and readiness to fight for New York City.[44]
A 2010 license plate check by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call showed that Weiner's vehicles were among several owned by members of Congress which had unpaid tickets. Weiner's past due fines, which spanned three years and totaled more than $2,000, were among the highest uncovered by Roll Call and were paid in full shortly after publication of the article.[45][46] On June 13, 2011, the New York Daily News reported that one of Weiner's vehicles, though it had been issued valid plates, was displaying expired plates that had been issued to another one of his vehicles.[47] Weiner had previously criticized UN diplomats for failing to pay parking tickets in New York City, claiming foreign nations owed $18,000,000 to the city.[27]
Sexting scandals[edit]
Main article: Anthony Weiner sexting scandals
On May 27, 2011, Weiner sent a link of a sexually explicit photograph of himself via his public Twitter account[48][49][50] to a woman who was following him on Twitter.[51] After several days of denying he had posted the image,[52][53][54][55] Weiner held a press conference at which he admitted he had "exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years" and apologized for his earlier denials.[56][57][58] After an explicit photo was leaked through the Twitter account of a listener of The Opie & Anthony Show,[59] Weiner announced on June 16, 2011, that he would resign from Congress,[60][61][62][63] and he formally did so on June 21.[64] In the special election held on September 13, 2011, to replace him, Republican businessman Bob Turner[65] defeated Democrat David Weprin to fill Weiner's seat.[66]
A second sexting scandal began on July 23, 2013, several months after Weiner returned to politics in the New York City mayoral race.[67] Explicit photos were sent by him under the alias "Carlos Danger" to a 22-year-old woman with whom Weiner had contact as late as April 2013, more than a year after he had left Congress.[67] The 22-year-old woman was later revealed as Sydney Leathers, an Indiana native who first came into contact with him when she expressed her disapproval of his extramarital behaviors.[68]
On August 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that Weiner had sexted another woman, including sending one picture while lying in bed with his young son.[69] The New York Times reported the next day that Weiner and his wife, Huma Abedin, intended to separate. Abedin announced her intention to separate from her husband by stating, "After long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband. Anthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy."[70]
On September 21, 2016, the Daily Mail published an article claiming that Weiner had engaged in sexting with a 15-year-old girl, and devices owned by Weiner were seized as part of an investigation into this incident.[71][72][73] The report prompted a criminal investigation and Weiner's laptop was seized. Emails pertinent to the Hillary Clinton email controversy were discovered on the laptop, prompting FBI Director James Comey to reopen that investigation late into the 2016 US presidential election.[74] Hillary Clinton has cited Comey's decision as one reason why she lost the election to Donald Trump.[75]
On January 31, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal prosecutors were weighing bringing child pornography charges against Weiner over the incident.[76][77] On May 19, 2017, the New York Times reported Weiner had surrendered to the Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, intending to plead guilty to a single charge of transferring obscene material to a minor under a plea agreement.[78] Under the agreement, Weiner faces a sentence of 21 to 27 months, and will be required to register as a sex offender. His sentencing is scheduled for September 8, 2017.[79]
New York mayoral elections[edit]
Main articles: New York City mayoral election, 2005 and New York City mayoral election, 2013
2005[edit]
Weiner sought the Democratic nomination to run for New York City mayor in 2005, vying against three other candidates. He had a three-part pitch to voters that included criticizing sitting Mayor Michael Bloomberg for his top-down style of management and promising a more democratic approach; against "passivity in City Hall" and for getting more federal money for the city; and a series of ideas on how to get the city to work better.[4] He presented a book of 50 "Real Solutions" and among his policy proposals were fixes for the health care and educational systems.[4] One idea already in play was a neighborhood scrubbing-up program he dubbed "Weiner's Cleaners".[4]
Weiner started out last in many polls,[4] but gained ground in the final weeks of the campaign, coming in second. Initial election returns had Fernando Ferrer with 39.95% of the vote, just shy of the 40% required to avoid a runoff against Weiner, who had 28.82%, but Weiner conceded, citing the need for party unity and denying rumors that various high-ranking New York Democrats, such as Senator Chuck Schumer and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, had urged him to concede. Absentee ballots put Ferrer over the 40% mark in the official primary election returns.[citation needed]
2009[edit]
Weiner appeared to be a candidate for mayor again in 2009.[80] However, in May 2009, after the New York City Council voted to extend term limits for Mayor Bloomberg, Weiner announced his decision not to run against the popular incumbent.[81] By July 2010, Weiner had raised $3.9 million for a potential campaign in the 2013 mayoral election, and was considered a leading contender in early polls.[82] According to the New York City Campaign Finance Board website, as of the March 2013 filing deadline Weiner had raised over $5.1 million, the second most among registered mayoral candidates, behind only Christine Quinn.[83]
2013[edit]
In an interview with The New York Times Magazine published online on April 10, 2013, Weiner said he would like to "ask people to give me a second chance" and was considering a run for mayor. He added that, "it's now or maybe never for me."[84]
In an interview on April 11, Rep. Keith Ellison endorsed Weiner, saying that he would love to see him become mayor of New York.[85] Weiner announced his intent to seek candidacy on a YouTube video on May 21, 2013.[86]
Weiner's platform for candidacy was summarized in "Keys to the City: 64 Ideas to Keep New York City the Capital of the Middle Class".[87]
On July 23, 2013, following the second set of sexting allegations that Weiner (using the alias "Carlos Danger") had continued to send explicitly photographs after his resignation from Congress, he acknowledged that he had sent messages to at least three women in 2012. One recipient stated that Weiner described himself to her as “an argumentative, perpetually horny middle-aged man”.[88] Following this admission, there were calls for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race; however, Weiner held a press conference with his wife, Huma Abedin, in which he announced that he would continue his campaign.[89][90][91] At the press conference, Weiner said, "I said that other texts and photos were likely to come out and today they have... I want to again say that I am very sorry to anyone who was on the receiving end of these messages and the disruption this has caused.”[92]
On July 27, 2013, Danny Kedem, Weiner's campaign chief, announced his resignation.[93] On September 10, 2013, Weiner lost the mayoral primary, winning only 4.9% of the vote.[94]
Post-congressional consulting and lobbying work[edit]
Less than a month after leaving Congress, Weiner created the consulting firm Woolf-Weiner Associates in July 2011, where he advised over a dozen companies including electronic medical records providers and biofuel firms, and worked with Covington & Burling, an international law firm. His work helped increase his combined family income to $496,000 in 2012, according to public disclosures. Weiner argued that despite contacting members of Congress on behalf of his clients, his work did not meet the legal definition of lobbying.[95] This was based on the so-called "Daschle Loophole" in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires only those who spend more than 20% of their time lobbying to register as lobbyists.[96]
Weiner was criticized by some on both the political left and right for his consulting work. During an interview on MSNBC, Lawrence O'Donnell criticized Weiner stating, "You went out to make money as a lobbyist... you did the classic hack thing and you know it." Weiner stated he was not a lobbyist.[97]
He was also criticized by the Sunlight Foundation for stealth lobbying, and falling under the aforementioned "Daschle Loophole", as the public never learned of his lobbying work until two years later when his nondisclosure agreements expired.[98]
In July 2015, Weiner was hired by MWW Group, a PR firm in New York City as a part-time consultant to serve on the company's board of advisors.[99][100]
By September 2015, his employment at MWW had ended, with the firm's head Michael Kempner stating "It has become clear that a handful of people and a few media outlets continue to be fixated on Anthony".[101] According to Politico New York, Weiner reportedly first learned of Kempner's decision through a mass email.[100]
On August 29, 2016, the New York Daily News said it would no longer carry Weiner's columns, which included his writings on New York City politics. On the same day, television channel NY1 said Weiner would not be reprising his contributor role on any of its shows.[102]
Personal life[edit]




Huma Abedin, October 2010


Weiner is Jewish.[103][104] He is a lifelong fan of both the New York Mets and New York Islanders.[105]
In May 2009, he became engaged to Huma Abedin, a long-time personal aide to Hillary Clinton, and they married in July 2010, with former President Bill Clinton officiating. Abedin is a practicing Muslim of Indian and Pakistani descent.[106][107] In December 2011, Abedin gave birth to a son, Jordan Zain Weiner.[108]
In August 2016, Abedin announced that she was separating from Weiner.[70] In the spring of 2017, Abedin announced her intent to file for divorce with sole physical custody of their son, Jordan. On May 19, 2017, she filed for divorce. [109]
In popular culture[edit]
Films[edit]
Weiner appeared in the Syfy movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No! (2015), portraying the Director of NASA.[110]
In 2013, Weiner and Abedin allowed filmmakers full access to his mayoral campaign. In 2016, the resulting documentary, Weiner, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.[111]
Play[edit]
In 2013, a production called The Weiner Monologues premiered at the Access Theater. Directed by Jonathan Harper Schlieman, the show was based on media coverage of Weiner's sexting scandal.[112]
Television[edit]
In 2014, he had a cameo appearance in an Alpha House episode.[113]

The health care portion of gross domestic product (GDP) was 16.0 percent, slightly higher than the 15.9 percent share in 2004.
