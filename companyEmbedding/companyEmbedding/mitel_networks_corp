Corporate history[edit]
Founding[edit]




Cover of the 1981 Mitel annual report


Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1972 (officially on June 8, 1972). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product - MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers. Cowpland is quoted as stating that it stands for MIke and Terry's Electronics, whereas Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4's "The Bottom Line" in May 2011.[citation needed] The pair formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, based on the original premise it stood for "MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers" and in order to protect their intellectual property rights of tone to pulse converter design from their employer who otherwise would have legal ownership rights. Their first shipment of three lawn mowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis). Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.[citation needed]
Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on the pair realized the significance of the then new microprocessor and software technology[2] to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX.[2] The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.[3]
In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices.
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.
In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management which revitalized the company.[citation needed]
In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.
Splits[edit]
In 2001, Mitel was split into two parts. The PBX division and the company name were sold to co-founder Matthews, who took it private. Matthews purchased 90% of the PBX division for $300 million Canadian with the original company retaining 10%.[citation needed] The PBX division then began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).
The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (Tsar of Links) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.
The intellectual property of Mitel Networks was spun out in 2001 and placed in a company called Mitel Knowledge Corporation.[citation needed] This company evolved into MKC Networks which makes a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.
An additional split took place in 2002 when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.[4]
New IPO[edit]
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]

Corporate history[edit]
Founding[edit]




Cover of the 1981 Mitel annual report


Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1972 (officially on June 8, 1972). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product - MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers. Cowpland is quoted as stating that it stands for MIke and Terry's Electronics, whereas Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4's "The Bottom Line" in May 2011.[citation needed] The pair formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, based on the original premise it stood for "MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers" and in order to protect their intellectual property rights of tone to pulse converter design from their employer who otherwise would have legal ownership rights. Their first shipment of three lawn mowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis). Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.[citation needed]
Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on the pair realized the significance of the then new microprocessor and software technology[2] to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX.[2] The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.[3]
In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices.
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.
In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management which revitalized the company.[citation needed]
In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.
Splits[edit]
In 2001, Mitel was split into two parts. The PBX division and the company name were sold to co-founder Matthews, who took it private. Matthews purchased 90% of the PBX division for $300 million Canadian with the original company retaining 10%.[citation needed] The PBX division then began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).
The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (Tsar of Links) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.
The intellectual property of Mitel Networks was spun out in 2001 and placed in a company called Mitel Knowledge Corporation.[citation needed] This company evolved into MKC Networks which makes a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.
An additional split took place in 2002 when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.[4]
New IPO[edit]
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]

On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]
Product lineup[21][edit]

Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) calling services
MiCloud: multi-tenant, multi-instance cloud platforms
MiContact Center: customer service platform for contact centers which includes ability to connect mobile enterprises with the mobile consumer

Mitel Is A Value Play In Unified Communications - Mitel Networks Corporation (NASDAQ:MITL) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Mitel Is A Value Play In Unified CommunicationsJul.14.17 | About: Mitel Networks (MITL) Focus Equity Stock Research Firm, long/short equity, value, techFocus EquitySummaryCloud deployment of unified communication is set to witness growth in coming years.Mitel will benefit amid differentiated products, backed by industry watchers.The stock is priced cheaply amid fears of on-premise stagnation.Successful cloud transition will unlock value.About the Company Mitel Networks Corporation (MITL) is a technology company that belongs to the industry of communication services. It’s a global provider of cloud and on-premise communication and collaboration services. Primary services of the company include IP-based telephony and Unified Communication as a Service, or UCaaS. The company - with its 2,500+ channel partners - supports more than 60 million users in more than 100 countries. Mitel Networks Corporation was founded in 2001 and is based in Ottawa, Canada. Product Insights Mitel’s offers MiCollab UC suite as a general unified communications solution across its product platform. Telephony, or call management, platforms of the company include MiVoice Business and MiVoice MX-ONE, targeting mid-sized to very large corporations. Video support is integrated with the UC suite and MiVoice telephony. The company also offers contact center support that can scale up to 15,000 agents for the enterprise version. Mitel is also involved in the provision of UCaaS, which combines unified communication suite, telephony and contact center. Revenue Insights The company primarily generates its revenue through selling unified communication and collaboration, or UCC, services. Mitel charges a fixed fee for its on-premise solution with recurring revenues originating from maintenance of on-premise hardware and software. Cloud services, however, follow a recurring fee model as the customer pay a per-month fixed fee. Therefore, revenue classified as cloud is recurring and has a less risk of sharp volatility. 

First Quarter 2017, 10-Q Mitel Networks
 The company generates around 60% of its revenue from product sales. Product sales primarily include enterprise customers that prefer on-premise or private deployment of unified services. Cloud segment include cloud based UCC services ranging from voice to collaboration. Cloud revenue witnessed a 9% year-over-year growth during the first quarter of 2017. Note that no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the company’s revenue during year ended 2016 indicating a less concentrated customer base. 

2016, 10-K Mitel Networks However, it should be noted that Mitel generates all of its revenue from UCC, as the company sold its mobile unit, which was involved in the provision of software-based network solutions for mobile carriers. All in all, the company is now focused on unified communications and is exposed to the respective growth in the industry. Let’s take a look at industry prospects. Industry Prospects Unified Communication, or UC, products are used by individuals for personal communication while corporations use UC to foster collaboration across work groups. There are more or less five key subsets of unified communications, including Telephony, Conferencing, Messaging, IM, and interface clients. As Mitel focuses on IP telephony and UCaaS, we will try to focus on the growth prospects in these areas. Hosted IP telephony market and UCaaS market is witnessing growth as cloud culture is becoming a norm. Transparency Market Research notes that increasing demand of unified communications is one of the key factors driving the enterprise telephony market; VoIP is also expected to increase the adoption of enterprise telephony. According to a forecast by Zion Research, VoIP market that includes IP telephone is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.1% during 2014-2021.
 However, the market is shifting away from the on-premise to cloud solutions. Frost & Sullivan forecasts the hosted IP telephony to increase from 8% of total business users in 2015 to 29% by 2022. Global Market Insights also expects a bullish trend in hosted unified communication market and forecasts the UC market to reach $96 billion by 2023. The report also predicts that the global UCaaS market will grow at 16.4 percent CAGR from 2016 to 2023. 

Source: Global Market Insights A report from MarketsandMarkets projects the enterprise collaboration market to reach $49.51 billion by 2021, translating into a CAGR of 13.2% during 2016-2021. 

Source: MarketsandMarkets 

Source: Research and Market IP PBX market, a primary market for Mitel, is also expected to witness growth in coming years. The market will reach $59 billion, witnessing a CAGR of 22.6% over the forecast period. To review, UCC is on the rise amid adoption of hosted IP and UCaaS services. High-single/low-teen growth is in the cards for the industry. IP PBX is also set to witness growth. However, the key point to note here is that corporations are moving from an on-premise to a cloud-based deployment. This can seriously hurt companies that won’t change their business model accordingly. About the enterprise UC market Gartner notes that:
 “The market is mature and overall growth has slowed. As a result, vendors that do not perform well will experience negative growth and revenue losses, leading them to exit the market. The stakes for enterprise decision makers are also high, due to the significant cost, visibility and business impact of their choices.” Mitel offers solutions ranging from on-premise to cloud. Cloud solutions of the company are witnessing adoption. Therefore, the company is well placed to execute its transition from on-premise to cloud and benefit from the growth prospects of the industry. Our thesis of Mitel follows below: Thesis 

Investor Presentation, March 2017 Market is transitioning towards cloud; Mitel is acting accordingly. As identified in industry analysis, cloud is where the growth lies in unified communications. Therefore, accepting change is the key to grow going forward. Mitel is exactly doing that. The company isn’t stuck with its on-premise solutions only. It’s embracing the change and beefing up its cloud offerings. The company has a complete UCaaS portfolio. Note that Gartner placed Mitel as a visionary in its UCaaS magic quadrant. Not only this, Mitel is a leading provider of enterprise communication services with around 3 million cloud customers; The company added 1 million cloud customers in 2016 alone. Frost & Sullivan noted that Mitel is one of the successful hosted IP telephony and UCaaS providers in North America. All in all, the fears regarding Mitel’s exposure to on-premise UC are over-done. That’s one of the reasons the stock is in the value territory. Once the market comprehends Mitel’s transition towards cloud, the stock will move towards its fair value. Integration and cost saving are key competitive advantages
 Mitel offers integrated unified communication service leading to cost savings for customers. Attractive pricing is one of the key advantages of the company. Further, cost effective migration to cloud also makes Mitel an attractive proposition for clients that want to move to cloud. Frost & Sullivan noted that Mitel offers cost-effective migration between on-premise and cloud solutions based on a single software stream. Diverse portfolio of solutions and modular nature of its solutions is another competitive advantage for Mitel that adds to cost savings. Modularity allows businesses to choose the features or services they need at a given time without having to pay for the whole package. This creates value for businesses and a competitive advantage for Mitel. Industry watchers have a positive view on Mitel Gartner has following to say about the company’s UC services. “The Mitel MiCollab, MiVoice, MiTeam, MiContact Center and MiCloud solutions provide a mature and comprehensive software suite. They are based on a common software architecture and a consistent user experience that can be distributed or centralized in a data center.” Frost & Sullivan also praised Mitel’s IP telephony and UCaaS product line in a recent award report. The research firm noted that a decent vision and execution along with differentiated capabilities allowed Mitel to grow at above average industry rates and capture market share.

 Note that Mitel is featured in all of the Gartner’s five Magic Quadrants for business communications. It’s also named a leader by Gartner in three Magic Quadrants, including unified communications, unified communications for mid-size enterprises, and magic quadrant for corporate telephony. 

 

 

 IDC also recognizes Mitel a borderline leader based on capabilities and strategies. Note that only blue-chips like Microsoft (MSFT) and Cisco (CSCO) were included as leaders in IDC MarketScape. Being a borderline leader, despite limited resources, speaks a lot about Mitel's corporate character. 

Source: IDC MarketScape Worldwide Unified Communications and Collaboration Vendor Assessment It can be seen that industry watchers including Gartner, IDC, and Frost & Sullivan have a positive view of Mitel’s products, strategy, and ability to execute.
 We must add that capabilities and ability to execute will increase going forward as the company recently acquired relevant assets from Toshiba. Toshiba is also named in Gartner's Magic Quadrant and IDC's MarketScape for unified communication. Addition of Toshiba will increase Mitel’s ability to execute, which will send it further up the Magic Quadrant and MarketScape going forward. As vendor guides are an important reference point, improvement in ranks can affect sales and market share of Mitel Networks. Valuation also reveals upside Although unified communication industry is set to witness growth. Almost zero growth is assumed for Mitel to drive a base case valuation. Industry growth is assumed to be offset by the cannibalization of revenue from an on-premise to cloud transition. Further, the company generates more than 50% of its revenue from on-premise solution, which is declining. This decline will also offset the growth achieved through cloud adoption. Therefore, a growth rate of 1% in assumed in perpetuity. Note that this won’t hold true if Mitel manages to shift its revenue base quickly towards clouds. Investors should look out for revenue share in future. Anyhow, the valuation follows below. Assumptions:  1% growth in perpetuity. Cost of equity is expected to grow in line with earnings CAPM is used to calculate the cost of equity. Analyst consensus EPS for 2017 and 2018 is used as a proxy for valuation purpose.  

 


 Based on a 1% perpetual growth, valuation reveals a price target of $8.6 translating into an upside of more than 20%. We believe the upside is asymmetric as growth is expected in cloud, and also, Mitel has strong offerings in enterprise unified communication. The cheap price of Mitel is also validated by the fact the company is trading at 8.7 times forward earnings while communication equipment industry is trading at a PE of~19 Some Slides from the Analyst Day 

 

 

 

 Final Thoughts Mitel is exposed to the growth of unified communications, including hosted IP and UCaaS. The company is demonstrating a shift towards cloud and is not sitting idle. Competitive advantages like product integration, modular deployment, and attractive pricing enabled through cost saving tactics will allow the company to penetrate the cloud UC market. Industry watchers also hold a positive opinion about Mitel’s products.
 We believe that Mitel will be able to successfully transition towards cloud, and it will benefit from the growth of cloud unified communications. The reason is simple. The company offers differentiated products. Therefore, customer will stick to Mitel as long as the company offers cloud solutions. We believe that analysts are under-weighting the growth prospects and ignoring the strength of Mitel’s products. Nonetheless, valuation based on analysts’ growth forecast reveals upside. In our view, the stock will go much higher as the company continues its transition towards cloud. Thesis Risk If the company fails to transition to cloud, it will be stuck with enterprise unified communication market (on-premise), which is declining. Investors should follow the revenue share developments closely; Consistent stagnation in cloud growth will be a signal to divest. Note that currently Mitel is witnessing growth in cloud.

Corporate history[edit]
Founding[edit]




Cover of the 1981 Mitel annual report


Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1972 (officially on June 8, 1972). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product - MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers. Cowpland is quoted as stating that it stands for MIke and Terry's Electronics, whereas Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4's "The Bottom Line" in May 2011.[citation needed] The pair formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, based on the original premise it stood for "MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers" and in order to protect their intellectual property rights of tone to pulse converter design from their employer who otherwise would have legal ownership rights. Their first shipment of three lawn mowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis). Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.[citation needed]
Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on the pair realized the significance of the then new microprocessor and software technology[2] to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX.[2] The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.[3]
In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices.
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.
In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management which revitalized the company.[citation needed]
In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.
Splits[edit]
In 2001, Mitel was split into two parts. The PBX division and the company name were sold to co-founder Matthews, who took it private. Matthews purchased 90% of the PBX division for $300 million Canadian with the original company retaining 10%.[citation needed] The PBX division then began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).
The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (Tsar of Links) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.
The intellectual property of Mitel Networks was spun out in 2001 and placed in a company called Mitel Knowledge Corporation.[citation needed] This company evolved into MKC Networks which makes a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.
An additional split took place in 2002 when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.[4]
New IPO[edit]
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]

Corporate history[edit]
Founding[edit]




Cover of the 1981 Mitel annual report


Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1972 (officially on June 8, 1972). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product - MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers. Cowpland is quoted as stating that it stands for MIke and Terry's Electronics, whereas Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4's "The Bottom Line" in May 2011.[citation needed] The pair formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, based on the original premise it stood for "MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers" and in order to protect their intellectual property rights of tone to pulse converter design from their employer who otherwise would have legal ownership rights. Their first shipment of three lawn mowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis). Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.[citation needed]
Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on the pair realized the significance of the then new microprocessor and software technology[2] to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX.[2] The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.[3]
In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices.
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.
In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management which revitalized the company.[citation needed]
In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.
Splits[edit]
In 2001, Mitel was split into two parts. The PBX division and the company name were sold to co-founder Matthews, who took it private. Matthews purchased 90% of the PBX division for $300 million Canadian with the original company retaining 10%.[citation needed] The PBX division then began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).
The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (Tsar of Links) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.
The intellectual property of Mitel Networks was spun out in 2001 and placed in a company called Mitel Knowledge Corporation.[citation needed] This company evolved into MKC Networks which makes a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.
An additional split took place in 2002 when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.[4]
New IPO[edit]
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]

Corporate history[edit]
Founding[edit]




Cover of the 1981 Mitel annual report


Michael Cowpland and Terry Matthews founded Mitel in 1972 (officially on June 8, 1972). Conventionally, its name is regarded as a combination of the founders’ first names and their first product - MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers. Cowpland is quoted as stating that it stands for MIke and Terry's Electronics, whereas Matthews confirmed the lawnmower acronym during an interview on BBC Radio 4's "The Bottom Line" in May 2011.[citation needed] The pair formed the corporation with the blessing of their employer, Bell Northern Research, based on the original premise it stood for "MIke and Terry's Lawnmowers" and in order to protect their intellectual property rights of tone to pulse converter design from their employer who otherwise would have legal ownership rights. Their first shipment of three lawn mowers was lost in shipping, so they quickly adjusted to produce a telephony tone receiver product (a tone-to-pulse converter for central office use based on Cowpland's Ph.D. thesis). Cowpland has also stated that the lawnmowers were not suited to Canadian lawns.[citation needed]
Following the success of the tone receiver, the founders extended their interest in the telecommunications industry. Early on the pair realized the significance of the then new microprocessor and software technology[2] to the design of telecom switches. In 1975, they introduced the SX200 PBX.[2] The company grew at a rate of over 100% per year for several years. They reached the $100 million annual revenue mark by 1981.[3]
In 1976, the company expanded into the semiconductor field with the acquisition of Siltex, a bankrupt ISO-CMOS foundry in Bromont, Quebec. This evolved into a semiconductor division that specialized in mixed signal and thick film hybrid devices.
The next major product was a large digital PBX called the SX2000. This was an early attempt to integrate the voice and data functions of office systems. It was conceived as moving beyond the PBX to become an Office Controller which would handle both voice and data applications within an organization.
In 1985, due to a financial crisis in the company, the board of directors created enough new shares to sell a controlling interest (51%) to British Telecom. British Telecom left the equipment business a few years later and sold its controlling interest in Mitel to an investment company called Schroder Ventures. Schroeder Ventures installed new management which revitalized the company.[citation needed]
In the meantime, Mitel continued to diversify its product line, introducing the successful SUPERSET line of phone terminals, the GX5000 Central Office, and the SMART-1 call controller, among others. Additionally Mitel developed and marketed a line of telecom-focussed semiconductor products.
Splits[edit]
In 2001, Mitel was split into two parts. The PBX division and the company name were sold to co-founder Matthews, who took it private. Matthews purchased 90% of the PBX division for $300 million Canadian with the original company retaining 10%.[citation needed] The PBX division then began a new chapter, under the name Mitel Networks, by developing a family of PBXs based on Internet standards for Voice over IP (VoIP).
The original company retained the semiconductor division. It was renamed Zarlink (Tsar of Links) Semiconductor to reflect its interest in networking.
The intellectual property of Mitel Networks was spun out in 2001 and placed in a company called Mitel Knowledge Corporation.[citation needed] This company evolved into MKC Networks which makes a family of SIP-based IP PBX systems.
An additional split took place in 2002 when the manufacturing arm was spun off out of Mitel Networks to become a contract manufacturer called BreconRidge. With these developments, the original Mitel Corporation was split into three companies: Zarlink (which though renamed is the original corporate entity), Mitel Networks, and BreconRidge.[4]
New IPO[edit]
On May 10, 2006, the new company announced its intention to launch an Initial public offering (IPO). No detailed information was released but the press indicated that the company hoped to raise $150 million.[5]
In April 2007, Mitel announced an agreement with Inter-Tel to purchase that company. This purchase would amount to a merger of equals with the merged company being twice the size of the original Mitel. This acquisition was completed in August 2007. Management had announced that the companies will carry on under the name Mitel. As a result of the merger, Mitel withdrew from the IPO registration process.[6]
Mitel Networks reverted to calling itself Mitel in product branding and marketing materials in 2004.[citation needed]
The separate company, known first as "Mitel Knowledge" and now as MKC Networks, was not a part of Mitel Networks, but was rather a company producing a product intended for sale through Mitel Networks.[citation needed] Both companies were and are ultimately controlled by Terry Matthews.
On April 22, 2010, Mitel became a public company,[7] listed on Nasdaq with the symbol MITL, and its initial offering stood at $14 per share.[8] Within a year, the stock price had dropped to $5.50[9] and was described by CNBC's Jim Cramer as one of the worst IPOs of the year.[10] Cramer blamed excessively optimistic pricing, excessive debt and the fear that company insiders would sell, dropping the stock value.[10]
During the company's Q1 conference call, Don Smith (CEO) announced his retirement from the company once the board of directors is able to find a suitable replacement. Smith said he would remain on the board after retirement.[11]
Acquisition[edit]
In June 2013, Mitel announced the completion of acquisition of one of its key suppliers, prairieFyre Software Inc., a privately held global provider of contact center, business analytics, and workforce optimization software and services. The net cash cost to Mitel for the acquisition of prairieFyre is approximately $20 million. prairieFyre is an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that has supplied Mitel with its existing contact center solution.[12]
In November 2013, Mitel announced the purchase of Aastra Technologies.[13]
On March 4, 2014, Mitel announced the acquisition of contact center supplier OAISYS, a leading developer of integrated call recording and quality management solutions.
In March 2015, Mitel announced to buy Mavenir Systems for $560 million.[14]
In April 2016, Mitel announced its intention to buy Polycom for $1.96 billion.[15] The deal was intended to give existing Polycom shareholders both cash and new Mitel shares for their holdings and result in Polycom shareholders owning 60% of the combined company. The acquisition was ended in favour of a merger with Siris Capital instead,[16] forcing PolyCom pay a $60 million USD fee to Mitel for cancelling the deal.[17]
Divestiture[edit]
On March 1, 2013, Mitel announced it has completed the sale of its DataNet CommSource business unit ("DataNet") in Sioux Falls to EarthBend, LLC.[18] In December 2016 the company announced that it will sell its mobility unit for $385 million to Xura and that will focus its business on Unified Communications.[19]
Litigation[edit]
In 2011 Mitel launched litigation against at least 2 Australian businesses for infringing on Mitel's trademark and the businesses for engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct under Australian consumer law. The first case against Melbourne telecommunications company Mytel was resolved, while the second case brought against a chain of mobile phone accessory and repair stores under the MyTel and HappyTel name was still waiting to be heard.[20]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
