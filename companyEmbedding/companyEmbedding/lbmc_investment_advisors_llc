Success Stories



Before you start on any journey, you must understand where you are currently and then map where you want to go. At LBMC, we begin each relationship with an Investment Check-Up, a service to benefit those who are unsure of the nature of the assets they have and how those assets fit together.

With years of investment experience, combined with an in-depth knowledge of both your financial situation and the relevant income tax and estate and gift tax laws, we can accurately pinpoint where you are, what’s working for you, and what are areas of concern. We put it all in writing with recommendations for enhancing your investment portfolio. You get the benefit of face-to-face personalized consultation that results in a roadmap for your financial future.

Investment Check-Up includes:

An Asset Allocation Chart specific to your holdings.
An Investment Position Review that examines each of your holdings for past performance, risk, security overlap, sector weighing, and expense.
A letter containing specific areas of concern for fine tuning your portfolio.
An Investment Consultation review session.


All we need from you:

Account statements for your various accounts
Personal financial statement, if available

Success Stories



Our focus is on Wealth Management. We believe success in properly managing client assets is not measured by performance statistics, but by our clients’ achieving their goals.

We believe that successful wealth management is about understanding and managing risk. Instead of chasing hot funds and betting on hot markets, we focus on developing a disciplined investment strategy that will provide our clients the investment returns they need with the least risk possible to their assets.

Our clients are not speculative, high-risk investors. Some are fiduciaries of corporate retirement plans, non-profit institutions, trusts or estates.  Others are individuals who have already established themselves financially. All seek to grow their assets over time while avoiding the numerous risks that abound in today’s investment environment.

We are successful because we understand the unique needs of our clients and because we are ideally positioned to respond to those needs. As an independent, fee-based firm we do not represent investment or insurance providers, nor do we receive commissions for recommending investments or trading securities.

We answer only to our clients, ensuring that the investments we recommend to them are those that we believe to be appropriate for them.

Our reality is a simple one: We succeed only when our clients succeed.

Forbes ranked Nashville as the No. 6 in the nation for “Job Growth” and No. 28 “Best Places for Business and Careers,” in their 2015 rankings. Therefore, it is easy to see why LBMC chose the Brentwood location, just 5 miles south of Nashville, as its primary location.
Nashville is a vibrant, engaging city filled with risk-takers and positive energy. Most notably known as the center for the music industry, Nashville is also a center for the healthcare and auto industries. With banking, transportation, publishing and tourism also experiencing tremendous growth in the Nashville market, clients get the added advantage of LBMC experts located in the nation’s epicenter of top industry segments.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation

            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Why a Raymond James Advisor






Our advisors have a 
legacy of serving clients differently.

                    It’s a more personal approach that goes far beyond an investment portfolio. It’s an ongoing and open dialogue about all aspects of your life, your goals and your financial vision. And it’s developing a long-term relationship built on understanding and trust. Your advisor is there for you throughout the planning and investing process, giving you objective and unbiased advice along the way.
                



Who Our Advisors Serve


Raymond James advisors serve clients with a variety of sophisticated financial planning needs. From families and individuals to business owners and institutions, your Raymond James advisor has the expertise and experience to provide guidance for a wide range of financial planning needs. They’ll take care of the big picture and the finer details with an approach that is as disciplined as it is strategic.
Learn More



Working with an Advisor


Your advisor is there to help you reach major milestones and all of the smaller ones in between. You’ll work together to build a customized plan just for you, taking into account all of your objectives, while weighing risk, prioritizing trade-offs and accounting for “what ifs.” And because your plan is a living document, your advisor will continually adapt it while utilizing the latest technology to identify potential unknowns and your changing needs, making adjustments that will help you reach your financial goals.
Get Started



Client Resources


Through your relationship with your Raymond James advisor, industry-leading resources are at your fingertips. You will have access to timely account information and research whenever and wherever you need it through Investor Access, which allows you to track and monitor all of your accounts in one safe and secure place.

About Raymond James


Since day one, we have always put our clients first. Your financial well-being is our focus. And we have never lost sight of that. Our advisors take a client-first approach and have the independence to serve you as you see fit. With a conservative approach to investing and a commitment to integrity, your advisor is backed by the size and resources of Raymond James, while also having the ability to maintain a small-firm feel. This gives you the attention and support you need to reach your goals.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
