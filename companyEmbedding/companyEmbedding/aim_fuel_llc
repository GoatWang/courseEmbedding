About AIM
AIM was established in 2009 to provide corporate and private jet operators with fuel dispatch and management services.
We at AIM work closely with in-house dispatchers and crews for each flight department. We act as an arm of most flight departments and thereby take workload off the shoulders of our client's staff.
Our support services are neutral in how we select international fuelers on behalf of our Part 91 customers. Our customers provide AIM with all their designated fuelers, and AIM takes care of securing quotes, arranging and dispatching the fuel orders.
We provide a simple yet critical service to mostly small and medium Part 91 operators.

Intro | AIM Fuel Management
























Take control and gain the upper handon your jet fuel sourcing











Intro





	We are in business to save you money on fuel in 3 unique ways:


Get you the best available price and terms

Save you countless man-hours

Catch all fuel overbillings and billing errors

New SMS programs and IS-BAO keep flight departments busier than ever with important dispatch, scheduling and safety priorities.
Operations staff and pilots rarely have the time and resources to run fuel software, customize scheduling systems and load fuel price data.  Fuel shopping is complex and tricky with suppliers quoting base prices without taxes and fees to get your business.
Flight departments can now hire their own dedicated fuel team that is equipped with all the right tools.  That team is AIM.  Our fuel management costs far less than having a dedicated fuel manager, while providing your flight department with global reach and powerful shopping tools.
We provide your flight department with a fuel solution that saves money on fuel purchases, and even more importantly, saves many valuable man-hours for your ops, crew and administrative staff.
Did you know that up to 32% of fuel billings can contain errors?  For example, a flight department spends $3,000,000 per year on fuel, they can easily be missing over $150,000 in overbillings and billing errors that simply get paid.   We reconcile all of your fuel billings with the supplier quotes, and catch every over-billing and billing error.  You get an alert from us whenever a bill does not match a quote.
Our fuel service is transparent, efficient and cost effective. We make no commissions from suppliers and all payments for fuel are between the customer and the fuel supplier. We are simply your fuel shopper and dispatcher, we are not a broker or reseller.
One pilot recently told us that if we can save him just 2% per year, signing up for AIM service is a "no-brainer."
We will save your flight department between 3-10% annually on fuel costs or we refund our service fees for the year.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
