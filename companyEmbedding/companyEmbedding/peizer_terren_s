About MeHome / About Me






Terren Scott Peizer dubbed the “Zelig of Wall Street” is currently the Chairman of his personal Los Angeles-based investment company, Acuitas Group Holdings (AGH), which in turn owns 100% of Crede Capital Group (CCG) which invests in public companies, and provides growth capital to small and medium-sized enterprises. Since its inception in June 2009, CCG has provided companies with capital commitments and funding in excess of $1.2 Billion. Besides its ownership of Crede Capital, Acuitas Group owns 78% of Catasys, Inc. a provider of proprietary big data based analytics and predictive modeling driven behavioral health management services for health plans; and owns 100% of NeurMedix, Inc., a biotech company that develops and commercializes disease modifying small molecules to treat neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Migraine disease, Huntington’s disease, ALS, MS, Epilepsy, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Retina disease. Peizer is Founder, Chairman of the three Acuitas companies, and is CEO of Catasys, Inc. and Crede Capital Group. Having developed a bioscience and healthcare expertise, Peizer’s Crede Capital became the largest shareholder in 22nd Century Group, Inc., a public company that is commercializing bio-plant technology to harm-reduce tobacco, creating very low nicotine and very low tar tobacco products which affect levels of addiction and cancer causing carcinogens. On October 1, 2015 New England Journal of Medicine published a landmark study on the company’s very low nicotine spectrum cigarettes. In October 2014, Peizer and 22nd Century formed a JV to commercialize the company’s products in China with China National Tobacco Company, the largest tobacco company in the world and the largest monopoly in China. China represents over 50% of the worldwide tobacco market.
Raised in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Peizer has frequently noted the importance of his family and his Ohio upbringing in various interviews. Although he has been called “One of Wall Street’s top players”, Peizer has exhibited a humble and modest lifestyle consistent with his Midwestern upbringing. It is believed that he still lives in the same condominium he first purchased in the 1980s when he moved to California.
Over the years, Peizer has been the largest beneficial stockholder and has held various senior executive positions within several technology and biotech companies. Peizer, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has extensive background in venture capital, investing, Mergers and Acquisitions and corporate finance. He has provided his expertise and assisted companies by assembling management teams, boards of directors and scientific advisory boards, formulating business and financial strategies, and establishing investor relations. Peizer has held senior executive positions with some of the top investment banking firms such as Goldman Sachs, First Boston and Drexel Burnham Lambert.
In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was recruited by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was believed to be the youngest associate during that era. In 1983 he was recruited by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader. He was occasionally referred to as the “Michael Milken of the East Coast”, as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market. During his time at First Boston, Peizer led the first financing for a little known reverse merger company, Danaher Inc. Today Danaher is one of America’s largest industrial companies. Peizer’s most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner’s insolvent Turner Broadcasting Corporation which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp’s CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.
In the spring of 1985,in an effort to remove the competition from the marketplace, Michael Milken recruited the young Peizer as a Senior Vice President of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Michael Milken immediately anointed Peizer as his “Protege and Lefthand Man,”  as they shared clients, desk and phone before taking over all of Milken’s direct client responsibilities, which made Peizer the most productive in the High Yield Bond department.
In 1990, after being laid off with 5,300 other Drexel employees in the midst of Drexel’s liquidation Peizer purchased a minor league basketball team, the Omaha Racers. After his purchase, the Racers won the CBA Championship and Peizer took that opportunity to sell the team.
With “Peizer’s reputation as one of Milken’s sharp-elbowed traders preceding him,”[10] Peizer then started his investment company Beachwood Financial and Wendover Financial Corporation before teaming up with Neil Cole. Peizer and Cole went on to capitalize the company Candies, which is the predecessor to today’s multibillion-dollar Iconix Brand Group. During Peizer’s early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as “lender of almost last resort”[11]but Peizer’s investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages. From 1997 to 1999 Peizer worked with Richard B. Hollis to raise funding for Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals through a reverse merger; the company was developing drugs for HIV and other infectious diseases and during that time Peizer became so immersed in the scientific literature about HIV and AIDS and in the market for HIV drugs that colleagues started calling him “Dr. Peizer.”
From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder. In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry’s dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties. Many of these companies, including Cray, Catasys,  and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer’s tenure.
Peizer’s investment philosophy was taking shape during these years, which according to Peizer, was to “Invest in situations where you tip the playing field in your favor and Invest in companies with low market caps but with the ability to change the way its industry does things.” Peizer applied his financial acumen and structuring expertise to minimize his investment at risk, but allow for exponential returns. This philosophy has served Peizer well, and it also points to his founding of Hythiam and Xcorporeal. Peizer has often stated his hopes that the two companies will change the addiction treatment and kidney dialysis industries, respectively.

Early career[edit]
In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was recruited by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was believed to be the youngest associate during that era. In 1983 he was recruited by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader. He was occasionally referred to as the "Michael Milken of the East Coast", as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market.

Peizer's most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner's insolvent Turner Broadcasting Corporation which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp's CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.
In the spring of 1985,in an effort to remove the competition from the marketplace, Michael Milken recruited the young Peizer as a Senior Vice President of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Michael Milken immediately anointed Peizer as his "Protege and Lefthand Man," [9] as they shared clients, desk and phone before taking over all of Milken's direct client responsibilities, which made Peizer the most productive in the High Yield Bond department.
In 1990, after being laid off with 5,300 other Drexel employees in the midst of Drexel's liquidation Peizer purchased a minor league basketball team, the Omaha Racers. After his purchase, the Racers won the CBA Championship and Peizer took that opportunity to sell the team.
With "Peizer's reputation as one of Milken's sharp-elbowed traders preceding him,"[10] Peizer then started his investment company Beachwood Financial and Wendover Financial Corporation before teaming up with Neil Cole. Peizer and Cole went on to capitalize the company Candies, which is the predecessor to today's multibillion-dollar Iconix Brand Group. During Peizer's early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as "lender of almost last resort"[11] but Peizer's investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages. From 1997 to 1999 Peizer worked with Richard B. Hollis to raise funding for Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals through a reverse merger; the company was developing drugs for HIV and other infectious diseases and during that time Peizer became so immersed in the scientific literature about HIV and AIDS and in the market for HIV drugs that colleagues started calling him "Dr. Peizer."[12][13]
From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder.[14] In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry's dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties.[15] Many of these companies, including Cray, Hythiam and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer's tenure.
Peizer's investment philosophy was taking shape during these years, which according to Peizer, was to "Invest in situations where you tip the playing field in your favor and Invest in companies with low market caps but with the ability to change the way its industry does things."[16] Peizer applied his financial acumen and structuring expertise to minimize his investment at risk, but allow for exponential returns. This philosophy has served Peizer well, and it also points to his founding of Hythiam and Xcorporeal. Peizer has often stated his hopes that the two companies will change the addiction treatment and kidney dialysis industries, respectively.
Major Deals and Financial Transactions[edit]
Although there have been no recent attempts to estimate Peizer's wealth, the Los Angeles Times confirmed his net worth at $50 million back in 1994.[17] While discussing the unusual step of Peizer investing his own personal net worth in some investment deals, the paper stated that he "avoids the usual accoutrements of wealth, such as big houses and expensive cars." The reporter also noted that "Peizer still lives in the condo he bought nine years ago, when he came west to sit at Milken's left hand."[18]
However, despite his modest surroundings, Peizer has been involved in some of the top U.S. financial transactions. For instance, while at Drexel, Peizer was involved in financing some of the largest multibillion-dollar corporate takeovers of the 1980s, including Ted Turner's purchase of MGM/UA Entertainment Co.and the buyout of Beatrice foods, Storer Cable,and RJR Nabisco. Peizer and his clients also led the financings of America's most innovative and pioneering companies.[19] This is best exemplified by the capitalizing of McCaw Cellular, the nation's first national cell phone carrier, which later became AT&T Cellular. Peizer and his clients led financings for such well known Industrialists as: Ron Perlman, John Malone, Carl Icahn, Ted Turner, Nelson Peltz and Rupert Murdoch. Peizer and his clients also financed many of the early buyouts of LBO pioneers KKR, Blackstone Group and The Carlyle Group. On the heels of the Turner/MGM/UA deal, Peizer became a magnet for entertainment deals and financings. One such deal, chronicled in the book "Hit and Run,"[20] married Peter Gruber and John Peter's, Guber Peter's & Co. with Burt Surgarman's Barris Industries. Motivated by Barris' $100 million cash hoard, Peizer merged the two companies, which then were immediately parleyed into Sony Pictures.
Peizer surprised the financial markets when he successfully outbid Billionaire Alec Gores Technology Group in a takeover bid for Cray Research (now Cray, Inc.) by the much smaller Peizer-controlled, Tera Computer Co. Tera issued cash, stock and notes to purchase the once-struggling supercomputer company from Silicon Graphics. Over the years, Cray has developed many of the supercomputers used by the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, pharmaceutical, aerospace, oil drilling and weather and seismic industries. Within two years of Peizer's acquisition, Cray's market capitalization grew from $25 million to $1.3 Billion. His departure would have a profound effect as Peizer became vitally integral to the companies and developed an investor following. When a press release in 1999 "announced his "resignation" claiming his "objectives have been achieved," the stock dropped 16% on the day of the announcement. The stock has drifted further south to $13.50, off 47% from its 52-week high, from Peizer's resignation."
Prometa citicism[edit]
It was Peizer’s half brother's struggle with addiction that spurred him to found the Prometa treatment program in 2003 and launch Hythiam,Inc.in 2004. Peizer capitalized the company with in excess of $170 million in capital.[21][22] Prometa combines three medications as a treatment for substance dependence, which became known as the Prometa Treatment Protocol. The medications involved are all FDA approved.[23] Combining them for addiction treatment is different from the purposes for which they were individually approved. This is known as prescribing medications for "Off-label" use. More than 31 percent of all prescriptions prescribed by physicians are written for " off-label" use.[24]
Peizer was successful in getting Hythiam listed on the NASDAQ Global Market Exchange, using a technique Peizer has used many times before and has become Wall Street's leader in: the reverse merger or reverse public offering (RPO). Hythiam's treatment went on to help thousands of patients end their dependence and get better. Peizer and Hythiam caught the addiction industry's eye for not waiting until there was enough scientific "proof" that Hythiam's treatment was truly effective. Subsequent studies have since validated Hythiam's and Peizer's claims.[25] In July 2010, Hythiam and Peizer gained their first heath plan customer (Health Plan of Nevada,Inc. ), joining Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers in its adoption of Hythiam's Catasys Integrated Substance Dependence Treatment Solution. Peizer still envisions Hythiam's treatment methodology being deployed throughout the nation.
Hythiam gained some notice for its 2006 ad campaign featuring deceased comedian Chris Farley, with the slogan, "It wasn't all his fault" (alluding to his death from a drug overdose). The company paid $25,000 to Farley's estate in order to use his image.[26] This advertisement campaign garnered national attention, as Peizer became a fixture on the American news circuit, regularly appearing on national news syndicates such as Fox News, CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, and CNBC's Squawk Box and Mad Money. Despite questions about its tastefulness and criticism from addiction treatment providers for advertising direct to consumers, Peizer defended the campaign as "creating awareness" about addiction as a medical disease, not a social and psychological personality disorder. Other critics focused on the company's emphasis on sales over research that would establish the validity of Prometa, especially since the FDA restricts marketing of drugs to the purpose for which they have been approved. Peizer justified the company's approach in a 60 Minutes episode as providing information about the treatment protocol to physicians, since Hythiam does not market the medications directly to consumers. The physicians in the practice of medicine, then prescribe the medications to the patients in need.[11]The FDA allows physicians to prescribe all FDA approved medications off label in the practice of medicine. Addiction experts marveled that Peizer was exploiting a nuance and "loophole."

During Peizer's early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as "lender of almost last resort"[11] but Peizer's investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages. From 1997 to 1999 Peizer worked with Richard B. Hollis to raise funding for Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals through a reverse merger; the company was developing drugs for HIV and other infectious diseases and during that time Peizer became so immersed in the scientific literature about HIV and AIDS and in the market for HIV drugs that colleagues started calling him "Dr. Peizer."[12][13]
From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder.[14] In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry's dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties.[15] Many of these companies, including Cray, Hythiam and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer's tenure.
Peizer's investment philosophy was taking shape during these years, which according to Peizer, was to "Invest in situations where you tip the playing field in your favor and Invest in companies with low market caps but with the ability to change the way its industry does things."[16] Peizer applied his financial acumen and structuring expertise to minimize his investment at risk, but allow for exponential returns. This philosophy has served Peizer well, and it also points to his founding of Hythiam and Xcorporeal. Peizer has often stated his hopes that the two companies will change the addiction treatment and kidney dialysis industries, respectively.
Major Deals and Financial Transactions[edit]
Although there have been no recent attempts to estimate Peizer's wealth, the Los Angeles Times confirmed his net worth at $50 million back in 1994.[17] While discussing the unusual step of Peizer investing his own personal net worth in some investment deals, the paper stated that he "avoids the usual accoutrements of wealth, such as big houses and expensive cars." The reporter also noted that "Peizer still lives in the condo he bought nine years ago, when he came west to sit at Milken's left hand."[18]
However, despite his modest surroundings, Peizer has been involved in some of the top U.S. financial transactions. For instance, while at Drexel, Peizer was involved in financing some of the largest multibillion-dollar corporate takeovers of the 1980s, including Ted Turner's purchase of MGM/UA Entertainment Co.and the buyout of Beatrice foods, Storer Cable,and RJR Nabisco. Peizer and his clients also led the financings of America's most innovative and pioneering companies.[19] This is best exemplified by the capitalizing of McCaw Cellular, the nation's first national cell phone carrier, which later became AT&T Cellular. Peizer and his clients led financings for such well known Industrialists as: Ron Perlman, John Malone, Carl Icahn, Ted Turner, Nelson Peltz and Rupert Murdoch. Peizer and his clients also financed many of the early buyouts of LBO pioneers KKR, Blackstone Group and The Carlyle Group. On the heels of the Turner/MGM/UA deal, Peizer became a magnet for entertainment deals and financings. One such deal, chronicled in the book "Hit and Run,"[20] married Peter Gruber and John Peter's, Guber Peter's & Co. with Burt Surgarman's Barris Industries. Motivated by Barris' $100 million cash hoard, Peizer merged the two companies, which then were immediately parleyed into Sony Pictures.
Peizer surprised the financial markets when he successfully outbid Billionaire Alec Gores Technology Group in a takeover bid for Cray Research (now Cray, Inc.) by the much smaller Peizer-controlled, Tera Computer Co. Tera issued cash, stock and notes to purchase the once-struggling supercomputer company from Silicon Graphics. Over the years, Cray has developed many of the supercomputers used by the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, pharmaceutical, aerospace, oil drilling and weather and seismic industries. Within two years of Peizer's acquisition, Cray's market capitalization grew from $25 million to $1.3 Billion. His departure would have a profound effect as Peizer became vitally integral to the companies and developed an investor following. When a press release in 1999 "announced his "resignation" claiming his "objectives have been achieved," the stock dropped 16% on the day of the announcement. The stock has drifted further south to $13.50, off 47% from its 52-week high, from Peizer's resignation."
Prometa citicism[edit]
It was Peizer’s half brother's struggle with addiction that spurred him to found the Prometa treatment program in 2003 and launch Hythiam,Inc.in 2004. Peizer capitalized the company with in excess of $170 million in capital.[21][22] Prometa combines three medications as a treatment for substance dependence, which became known as the Prometa Treatment Protocol. The medications involved are all FDA approved.[23] Combining them for addiction treatment is different from the purposes for which they were individually approved. This is known as prescribing medications for "Off-label" use. More than 31 percent of all prescriptions prescribed by physicians are written for " off-label" use.[24]
Peizer was successful in getting Hythiam listed on the NASDAQ Global Market Exchange, using a technique Peizer has used many times before and has become Wall Street's leader in: the reverse merger or reverse public offering (RPO). Hythiam's treatment went on to help thousands of patients end their dependence and get better. Peizer and Hythiam caught the addiction industry's eye for not waiting until there was enough scientific "proof" that Hythiam's treatment was truly effective. Subsequent studies have since validated Hythiam's and Peizer's claims.[25] In July 2010, Hythiam and Peizer gained their first heath plan customer (Health Plan of Nevada,Inc. ), joining Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers in its adoption of Hythiam's Catasys Integrated Substance Dependence Treatment Solution. Peizer still envisions Hythiam's treatment methodology being deployed throughout the nation.
Hythiam gained some notice for its 2006 ad campaign featuring deceased comedian Chris Farley, with the slogan, "It wasn't all his fault" (alluding to his death from a drug overdose). The company paid $25,000 to Farley's estate in order to use his image.[26] This advertisement campaign garnered national attention, as Peizer became a fixture on the American news circuit, regularly appearing on national news syndicates such as Fox News, CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, and CNBC's Squawk Box and Mad Money. Despite questions about its tastefulness and criticism from addiction treatment providers for advertising direct to consumers, Peizer defended the campaign as "creating awareness" about addiction as a medical disease, not a social and psychological personality disorder. Other critics focused on the company's emphasis on sales over research that would establish the validity of Prometa, especially since the FDA restricts marketing of drugs to the purpose for which they have been approved. Peizer justified the company's approach in a 60 Minutes episode as providing information about the treatment protocol to physicians, since Hythiam does not market the medications directly to consumers. The physicians in the practice of medicine, then prescribe the medications to the patients in need.[11]The FDA allows physicians to prescribe all FDA approved medications off label in the practice of medicine. Addiction experts marveled that Peizer was exploiting a nuance and "loophole."

Terren Scott Peizer


Born
Beachwood, Ohio


Alma mater
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Occupation
International Financier


Terren Scott Peizer dubbed the "Zelig of Wall Street"[1][2] is currently the Chairman of his personal Los Angeles-based investment company, Acuitas Group Holdings (AGH), which in turn owns 100% of Crede Capital Group (CCG) which invests in public companies, and provides growth capital to small and medium-sized enterprises. Since its inception in June 2009, CCG has provided companies with capital commitments and funding in excess of $1.2 Billion.[3] Besides its ownership of Crede Capital, Acuitas Group owns 72% of Catasys, Inc.,[4] a provider of proprietary big data based analytics and predictive modeling driven behavioral health management services for health plans; and owns 100% of NeurMedix, Inc., a biotech company that develops and commercializes disease modifying small molecules to treat neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Migraine disease, Huntington’s disease, ALS, MS, Epilepsy, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Retina disease. Peizer is Founder, Chairman of the three Acuitas companies, and is CEO of Catasys, Inc. and Crede Capital Group. Having developed a bioscience and healthcare expertise, Peizer’s Crede Capital became the largest shareholder in 22nd Century Group, Inc., a public company that is commercializing bio-plant technology to harm-reduce tobacco, creating very low nicotine and very low tar tobacco products which affect levels of addiction and cancer causing carcinogens. On October 1, 2015 New England Journal of Medicine published a landmark study on the company’s very low nicotine spectrum cigarettes.[5] In October 2014, Peizer and 22nd Century formed a JV to commercialize the company’s products in China with China National Tobacco Company, the largest tobacco company in the world and the largest monopoly in China. China represents over 50% of the worldwide tobacco market.[6]
Raised in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Peizer has frequently noted the importance of his family and his Ohio upbringing in various interviews. Although he has been called "One of Wall Street’s top players",[7] Peizer has exhibited a humble and modest lifestyle consistent with his Midwestern upbringing. It is believed that he still lives in the same condominium he first purchased in the 1980s when he moved to California.
Over the years, Peizer has been the largest beneficial stockholder and has held various senior executive positions within several technology and biotech companies.[8] Peizer, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has extensive background in venture capital, investing, Mergers and Acquisitions and corporate finance. He has provided his expertise and assisted companies by assembling management teams, boards of directors and scientific advisory boards, formulating business and financial strategies, and establishing investor relations. Peizer has held senior executive positions with some of the top investment banking firms such as Goldman Sachs, First Boston and Drexel Burnham Lambert.

Early career[edit]
In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was recruited by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was believed to be the youngest associate during that era. In 1983 he was recruited by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader. He was occasionally referred to as the "Michael Milken of the East Coast", as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market. During his time at First Boston, Peizer led the first financing for a little known reverse merger company, Danaher Inc. Today Danaher is one of America's largest industrial companies. Peizer's most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner's insolvent Turner Broadcasting Corporation which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp's CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.
In the spring of 1985,in an effort to remove the competition from the marketplace, Michael Milken recruited the young Peizer as a Senior Vice President of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Michael Milken immediately anointed Peizer as his "Protege and Lefthand Man," [9] as they shared clients, desk and phone before taking over all of Milken's direct client responsibilities, which made Peizer the most productive in the High Yield Bond department.
In 1990, after being laid off with 5,300 other Drexel employees in the midst of Drexel's liquidation Peizer purchased a minor league basketball team, the Omaha Racers. After his purchase, the Racers won the CBA Championship and Peizer took that opportunity to sell the team.
With "Peizer's reputation as one of Milken's sharp-elbowed traders preceding him,"[10] Peizer then started his investment company Beachwood Financial and Wendover Financial Corporation before teaming up with Neil Cole. Peizer and Cole went on to capitalize the company Candies, which is the predecessor to today's multibillion-dollar Iconix Brand Group. During Peizer's early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as "lender of almost last resort"[11] but Peizer's investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages.

From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder.[14] In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry's dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties.[15] Many of these companies, including Cray, Hythiam and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer's tenure.

Terren Scott Peizer


Born
Beachwood, Ohio


Alma mater
Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania


Occupation
International Financier


Terren Scott Peizer dubbed the "Zelig of Wall Street"[1][2] is currently the Chairman of his personal Los Angeles-based investment company, Acuitas Group Holdings (AGH), which in turn owns 100% of Crede Capital Group (CCG) which invests in public companies, and provides growth capital to small and medium-sized enterprises. Since its inception in June 2009, CCG has provided companies with capital commitments and funding in excess of $1.2 Billion.[3] Besides its ownership of Crede Capital, Acuitas Group owns 72% of Catasys, Inc.,[4] a provider of proprietary big data based analytics and predictive modeling driven behavioral health management services for health plans; and owns 100% of NeurMedix, Inc., a biotech company that develops and commercializes disease modifying small molecules to treat neuro-degenerative diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Migraine disease, Huntington’s disease, ALS, MS, Epilepsy, Traumatic Brain Injury, and Retina disease. Peizer is Founder, Chairman of the three Acuitas companies, and is CEO of Catasys, Inc. and Crede Capital Group. Having developed a bioscience and healthcare expertise, Peizer’s Crede Capital became the largest shareholder in 22nd Century Group, Inc., a public company that is commercializing bio-plant technology to harm-reduce tobacco, creating very low nicotine and very low tar tobacco products which affect levels of addiction and cancer causing carcinogens. On October 1, 2015 New England Journal of Medicine published a landmark study on the company’s very low nicotine spectrum cigarettes.[5] In October 2014, Peizer and 22nd Century formed a JV to commercialize the company’s products in China with China National Tobacco Company, the largest tobacco company in the world and the largest monopoly in China. China represents over 50% of the worldwide tobacco market.[6]
Raised in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Peizer has frequently noted the importance of his family and his Ohio upbringing in various interviews. Although he has been called "One of Wall Street’s top players",[7] Peizer has exhibited a humble and modest lifestyle consistent with his Midwestern upbringing. It is believed that he still lives in the same condominium he first purchased in the 1980s when he moved to California.
Over the years, Peizer has been the largest beneficial stockholder and has held various senior executive positions within several technology and biotech companies.[8] Peizer, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has extensive background in venture capital, investing, Mergers and Acquisitions and corporate finance. He has provided his expertise and assisted companies by assembling management teams, boards of directors and scientific advisory boards, formulating business and financial strategies, and establishing investor relations. Peizer has held senior executive positions with some of the top investment banking firms such as Goldman Sachs, First Boston and Drexel Burnham Lambert.

Early career[edit]
In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was recruited by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was believed to be the youngest associate during that era. In 1983 he was recruited by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader. He was occasionally referred to as the "Michael Milken of the East Coast", as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market. During his time at First Boston, Peizer led the first financing for a little known reverse merger company, Danaher Inc. Today Danaher is one of America's largest industrial companies. Peizer's most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner's insolvent Turner Broadcasting Corporation which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp's CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.
In the spring of 1985,in an effort to remove the competition from the marketplace, Michael Milken recruited the young Peizer as a Senior Vice President of Drexel Burnham Lambert. Michael Milken immediately anointed Peizer as his "Protege and Lefthand Man," [9] as they shared clients, desk and phone before taking over all of Milken's direct client responsibilities, which made Peizer the most productive in the High Yield Bond department.
In 1990, after being laid off with 5,300 other Drexel employees in the midst of Drexel's liquidation Peizer purchased a minor league basketball team, the Omaha Racers. After his purchase, the Racers won the CBA Championship and Peizer took that opportunity to sell the team.
With "Peizer's reputation as one of Milken's sharp-elbowed traders preceding him,"[10] Peizer then started his investment company Beachwood Financial and Wendover Financial Corporation before teaming up with Neil Cole. Peizer and Cole went on to capitalize the company Candies, which is the predecessor to today's multibillion-dollar Iconix Brand Group. During Peizer's early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as "lender of almost last resort"[11] but Peizer's investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages. From 1997 to 1999 Peizer worked with Richard B. Hollis to raise funding for Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals through a reverse merger; the company was developing drugs for HIV and other infectious diseases and during that time Peizer became so immersed in the scientific literature about HIV and AIDS and in the market for HIV drugs that colleagues started calling him "Dr. Peizer."[12][13]
From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder.[14] In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry's dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties.[15] Many of these companies, including Cray, Hythiam and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer's tenure.
Peizer's investment philosophy was taking shape during these years, which according to Peizer, was to "Invest in situations where you tip the playing field in your favor and Invest in companies with low market caps but with the ability to change the way its industry does things."[16] Peizer applied his financial acumen and structuring expertise to minimize his investment at risk, but allow for exponential returns. This philosophy has served Peizer well, and it also points to his founding of Hythiam and Xcorporeal. Peizer has often stated his hopes that the two companies will change the addiction treatment and kidney dialysis industries, respectively.
Major Deals and Financial Transactions[edit]
Although there have been no recent attempts to estimate Peizer's wealth, the Los Angeles Times confirmed his net worth at $50 million back in 1994.[17] While discussing the unusual step of Peizer investing his own personal net worth in some investment deals, the paper stated that he "avoids the usual accoutrements of wealth, such as big houses and expensive cars." The reporter also noted that "Peizer still lives in the condo he bought nine years ago, when he came west to sit at Milken's left hand."[18]
However, despite his modest surroundings, Peizer has been involved in some of the top U.S. financial transactions. For instance, while at Drexel, Peizer was involved in financing some of the largest multibillion-dollar corporate takeovers of the 1980s, including Ted Turner's purchase of MGM/UA Entertainment Co.and the buyout of Beatrice foods, Storer Cable,and RJR Nabisco. Peizer and his clients also led the financings of America's most innovative and pioneering companies.[19] This is best exemplified by the capitalizing of McCaw Cellular, the nation's first national cell phone carrier, which later became AT&T Cellular. Peizer and his clients led financings for such well known Industrialists as: Ron Perlman, John Malone, Carl Icahn, Ted Turner, Nelson Peltz and Rupert Murdoch. Peizer and his clients also financed many of the early buyouts of LBO pioneers KKR, Blackstone Group and The Carlyle Group. On the heels of the Turner/MGM/UA deal, Peizer became a magnet for entertainment deals and financings. One such deal, chronicled in the book "Hit and Run,"[20] married Peter Gruber and John Peter's, Guber Peter's & Co. with Burt Surgarman's Barris Industries. Motivated by Barris' $100 million cash hoard, Peizer merged the two companies, which then were immediately parleyed into Sony Pictures.
Peizer surprised the financial markets when he successfully outbid Billionaire Alec Gores Technology Group in a takeover bid for Cray Research (now Cray, Inc.) by the much smaller Peizer-controlled, Tera Computer Co. Tera issued cash, stock and notes to purchase the once-struggling supercomputer company from Silicon Graphics. Over the years, Cray has developed many of the supercomputers used by the U.S. defense and intelligence communities, pharmaceutical, aerospace, oil drilling and weather and seismic industries. Within two years of Peizer's acquisition, Cray's market capitalization grew from $25 million to $1.3 Billion. His departure would have a profound effect as Peizer became vitally integral to the companies and developed an investor following. When a press release in 1999 "announced his "resignation" claiming his "objectives have been achieved," the stock dropped 16% on the day of the announcement. The stock has drifted further south to $13.50, off 47% from its 52-week high, from Peizer's resignation."
Prometa citicism[edit]
It was Peizer’s half brother's struggle with addiction that spurred him to found the Prometa treatment program in 2003 and launch Hythiam,Inc.in 2004. Peizer capitalized the company with in excess of $170 million in capital.[21][22] Prometa combines three medications as a treatment for substance dependence, which became known as the Prometa Treatment Protocol. The medications involved are all FDA approved.[23] Combining them for addiction treatment is different from the purposes for which they were individually approved. This is known as prescribing medications for "Off-label" use. More than 31 percent of all prescriptions prescribed by physicians are written for " off-label" use.[24]
Peizer was successful in getting Hythiam listed on the NASDAQ Global Market Exchange, using a technique Peizer has used many times before and has become Wall Street's leader in: the reverse merger or reverse public offering (RPO). Hythiam's treatment went on to help thousands of patients end their dependence and get better. Peizer and Hythiam caught the addiction industry's eye for not waiting until there was enough scientific "proof" that Hythiam's treatment was truly effective. Subsequent studies have since validated Hythiam's and Peizer's claims.[25] In July 2010, Hythiam and Peizer gained their first heath plan customer (Health Plan of Nevada,Inc. ), joining Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers in its adoption of Hythiam's Catasys Integrated Substance Dependence Treatment Solution. Peizer still envisions Hythiam's treatment methodology being deployed throughout the nation.
Hythiam gained some notice for its 2006 ad campaign featuring deceased comedian Chris Farley, with the slogan, "It wasn't all his fault" (alluding to his death from a drug overdose). The company paid $25,000 to Farley's estate in order to use his image.[26] This advertisement campaign garnered national attention, as Peizer became a fixture on the American news circuit, regularly appearing on national news syndicates such as Fox News, CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, and CNBC's Squawk Box and Mad Money. Despite questions about its tastefulness and criticism from addiction treatment providers for advertising direct to consumers, Peizer defended the campaign as "creating awareness" about addiction as a medical disease, not a social and psychological personality disorder. Other critics focused on the company's emphasis on sales over research that would establish the validity of Prometa, especially since the FDA restricts marketing of drugs to the purpose for which they have been approved. Peizer justified the company's approach in a 60 Minutes episode as providing information about the treatment protocol to physicians, since Hythiam does not market the medications directly to consumers. The physicians in the practice of medicine, then prescribe the medications to the patients in need.[11]The FDA allows physicians to prescribe all FDA approved medications off label in the practice of medicine. Addiction experts marveled that Peizer was exploiting a nuance and "loophole."

Terren Peizer, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Catasys, Inc (NASDAQ/CATS). appeared on Fox Business News last night. When Making Money host Charles Payne asked Peizer about the economy, he redirected the conversation to the mental health crises in the country. Catasys, the leading provider of proprietary predictive analytics and integrated treatment solutions to the largest health plans in the country for the treatment of alcoholism, substance use disorder, depression and anxiety, was the first to identify the issues, quantify the issues, and provide innovative solutions to transform the mental health system. Catasys is rolling out the OnTrak program with the 7 largest health plans across the country which will make it the de facto industry standard in the coming years.  
Peizer further stated that only 10% of those that need treatment, seek treatment . Only 10% of the 10%, or 1% receive effective care. Hence, the crises. Catasys is focused on the 90%, the treatment avoidant population. Alarmingly, $200 billion is spent ineffectively on treatment for these diseases. This compares with $147 billion for cardiovascular disease and $122 billion for cancer.  More astoundingly, patients with a mental health disorder companioned with a co-morbid significant chronic disease (cardiovascular, diabetes, pulmonary, etc.) comprises 40% of the medical expense in the country. When Mr. Payne asked Peizer about ObamaCare, he replied, ” Whether it’s ObamaCare, TrumpCare, or Anarchy-Care, we need to improve patient health and lower medical cost.”

Peizer’s Catasys to Provide Depression, Anxiety, and SUD Treatment to Largest Medicaid Plan in Texas

Catasys Expands OnTrak-A Solution to Massachusetts with Leading National Health Insurance Provider 
LOS ANGELES, February 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — Catasys, Inc. (CATS), a provider of proprietary predictive analytics and integrated treatment solutions to health plans, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to expand its OnTrak™-A solution with one of the nation’s leading health plans to Massachusetts. The plan’s eligible commercial and Medicare Advantage members will be covered under OnTrak-A, a 52-week, multi-phase program in which enrolled members receive medical and psychosocial interventions, as well as intensive care coaching. 
“We are pleased to expand our OnTrak-A solution into Massachusetts for eligible commercial and Medicare Advantage members. This represents the eighth state in which we have announced the launch of the OnTrak-A program and builds on our existing operation in Massachusetts,” said Rick Anderson, Catasys’ President and COO. “We look forward to improving the health and lives of our enrolled members and their families while reducing overall medical treatment costs for the health plan.” 
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Mental Health Findings for 2013, approximately 20 million (8.5%) adults in the U.S. met criteria for a substance use disorder (i.e., illicit drug or alcohol dependence or abuse).

Catasys, Inc. Issues Letter to Shareholders 
Increasing Utilization and Expansions From Health Plans to Increase Equivalent Lives Under Contract in 2017
to More Than 20 Million
———
Such Adoption Portends to a Cash Receipts Run Rate of Approximately $126 Million 12 Months from Launch
Dear Catasys Shareholder,
We are pleased to update you, our valued shareholder, on the exciting events occurring throughout our business and will be taking steps to provide additional visibility into our progress going forward. The rapid pace at which we are expanding our engagements with the major U.S. health plans has dramatically increased the total number of equivalent lives we are reporting at the end of 2016. This growth is expected to have a significant impact on our financial performance for 2017.
The healthcare industry, in particular, health insurance companies and plans, typically take many years to allow a new entrant such as us to gain significant traction. It has taken the Company several years to prove out our business model, as it is currently accepted by many national health plan providers. During this time, we have found it virtually impossible to have enough visibility in our business to publicly provide accurate financial guidance and direction. Through this letter, we hope that you will sense something must be changing given our newly communicative posture.
Further, we will briefly discuss our vision; the healthcare industry issues that we are addressing; the proprietary nature of our products; the scalable nature of our business, and our near term expectations.    
Company Vision and Solution
The Company’s vision is to improve the behavioral health industry by providing an innovative proactive treatment solution with cost saving opportunities for health plan customers, and ultimately be able to scale its availability on a national and perhaps one day, international basis.
Today, we are focused on substance use disorder (SUD), depression and anxiety which comprise approximately
75% of behavioral health disorders. The U.S. currently has a passive system whereby treatment avoidant patients (cost, denial, stigma, access) need to seek out treatment, gain access to treatment, afford said treatment, and then receive the appropriate care that addresses both the physiological and psych-social aspects (“integrative care”) of these complex diseases.
Unfortunately, the more severe patients we serve have these diseases as co-morbid conditions of each other, and have other co-morbidities, such as cardiovascular, diabetes, renal, liver disease, etc. The average amount of costs associated with these patients directly related to the behavioral diseases alone is $30,000. These costs are predominantly from emergency room visits and in-patient hospital stays.
Catasys provides an integrated outpatient solution with proprietary analytics and predictive modeling, proprietary enrollment, engagement and modification of behavior techniques. Our solution effectively turns the passive system, treatment avoidant, minimal access to care, unidentified patient population to a proactive, replicable, scalable, national solution where we focus on the complete care of the patients.
The results from our solution have shown that patients are getting better, and the health insurance companies are
consistently saving 50% of the medical costs for each patient enrolled. Hence, there is a health plan incentive to pay
for all the associated treatment costs. Through OnTrak, behavioral health patients now have full treatment program coverage, increased access to treatment and effective care.  
First Quarter and Full Year 2017
Catasys has emerged as a leading healthcare analytics company providing proprietary value-added care for health plan members. We are like “Amazon and Uber” to the standard facilities-based behavioral health industry model, as we are virtual and scalable throughout the country, utilizing provider networks of independent contracted medical doctors and psychologists, companioned with our own Care Coaches, in an outpatient setting.
All of our existing health plan customers, including, Humana, Aetna, Centene, and HAMP, have expanded OnTrak to their other products and expanded geographically. We are now operating in 18 states, with more to come. This week we have seen for the first time that one of our customers expanded from our SUD OnTrak program to the OnTrak treatment of SUD, depression and anxiety.
While we have been growing revenues significantly year-over-year and sequentially, the numbers are quite small relative to what we expect in the coming year and beyond. We have worked through much of the customer specific logistical issues in 2016 that limited our revenues, and it appears that the “perfect storm” is beginning to culminate in the first quarter of 2017.
“Perfect Storm”
We anticipate shortly that all of our existing customers will be operating at or near full capacity for the lives under contract by the end of the first quarter of 2017, with additional opportunities to expand. We expect this growth to come throughout their eligible members, including Medicare, Medicaid, commercial, individual, and, hopefully, TRICARE (military and veterans), as well as, expansion throughout our depression and anxiety offerings.
It’s important to note that when a health plan contracts OnTrak for depression, anxiety and SUD, it represents an approximately 4.4X increase of the eligible population from which we enroll. We began the year with at or under 20% enrollment rates of eligible lives. We are constantly trying to improve our techniques and we are beginning to see the results. While we are only one quarter in, we are currently seeing a 20-25% enrollment rate which exceeds our expectations.
Another input to the “storm” is additional health insurance contracts. We expect to add more national and super-regional health plans. This will be a major impetus to revenue growth. Excitingly, we expect many of the new contracts to include the treatment of depression and anxiety. These will be the first instances of new customers contracting for all three disease states. We are hopeful that in 2017 we will have contracts in place with health plans that represent in excess of 75% of the commercially covered lives in the USA. We are hopeful that we will have contracts with 7 of the 8 largest health plans in the country. Importantly, all of our existing and future customers will continue to benefit from the trend in place, and expected to accelerate with the next administration, of more of the Medicare and Medicaid populations moving to managed care. These populations have an approximately 2.5X the eligible patients from which we enroll than a commercial population.
Unfortunately, another “tailwind” is the increasing rates of mental illness in the U.S. In a survey released this week, one out of six adults take psychiatric medications. Alarmingly, 85% of them are prescribed multiple refills. This is indicative of rising dependencies and associated medical costs. The government increasingly recognizes the U.S. mental health problem and has instituted the Mental Health Parity Act, and this week, the 21st Century Cures Act became law thereby improving U.S. mental health efforts.
The Result: Large Projected Revenue Streams
We believe that in 2017 we will nearly triple our Equivalent Lives (ELs) under contract from the current 7.5 million we have in place. Each 10 million ELs is anticipated to equate to a cash receipts run rate 12 months from launch of $63 million. Hence, 20 million ELs could translate to a cash receipts run rate of approximately $126 million 12 months from launch. Excitingly, this is only the beginning and would expect significant revenue and cash flow growth rates for years to come.
We are extremely excited for Catasys’ future growth. I certainly hope that you can sense my excitement for the coming year(s). Perhaps now you can understand why I personally invested in excess of $22 million into Catasys, Inc. Thank you for remaining dedicated to our Company’s vision which will hopefully transform the behavioral health industry.
I wish you a happy and healthy Holiday season, and a tremendous New Year for all Catasys shareholders.
Respectfully,
Terren S. Peizer

Learn about memorable moments in the evolution of Terren Peizer


FIFTIES


2014

Age 55





In October 2014, Peizer and 22nd Century formed a JV to commercialize the company’s products in China with China National Tobacco Company, the largest tobacco company in the world and the largest monopoly in China.
More Details
Hide Details
China represents over 50% of the worldwide tobacco market.
 Raised in Beachwood, Ohio, a suburb of Cleveland, Peizer has frequently noted the importance of his family and his Ohio upbringing in various interviews. Although he has been called "One of Wall Street’s top players", Peizer has exhibited a humble and modest lifestyle consistent with his Midwestern upbringing. It is believed that he still lives in the same condominium he first purchased in the 1980s when he moved to California.
 Over the years, Peizer has been the largest beneficial stockholder and has held various senior executive positions within several technology and biotech companies. Peizer, a graduate of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania has extensive background in venture capital, investing, Mergers and Acquisitions and corporate finance. He has provided his expertise and assisted companies by assembling management teams, boards of directors and scientific advisory boards, formulating business and financial strategies, and establishing investor relations. Peizer has held senior executive positions with some of the top investment banking firms such as Goldman Sachs, First Boston and Drexel Burnham Lambert.





2010

Age 51





In July 2010, Hythiam and Peizer gained their first heath plan customer (Health Plan of Nevada,Inc.), joining Ford Motor Company and the United Auto Workers in its adoption of Hythiam's Catasys Integrated Substance Dependence Treatment Solution.
More Details
Hide Details
Peizer still envisions Hythiam's treatment methodology being deployed throughout the nation.





FORTIES


2006

Age 47





Hythiam gained some notice for its 2006 ad campaign featuring deceased comedian Chris Farley, with the slogan, "It wasn't all his fault" (alluding to his death from a drug overdose).
More Details
Hide Details
The company paid $25,000 to Farley's estate in order to use his image. This advertisement campaign garnered national attention, as Peizer became a fixture on the American news circuit, regularly appearing on national news syndicates such as Fox News, CNN, Good Morning America, The Today Show, and CNBC's Squawk Box and Mad Money. Despite questions about its tastefulness and criticism from addiction treatment providers for advertising direct to consumers, Peizer defended the campaign as "creating awareness" about addiction as a medical disease, not a social and psychological personality disorder. Other critics focused on the company's emphasis on sales over research that would establish the validity of Prometa, especially since the FDA restricts marketing of drugs to the purpose for which they have been approved. Peizer justified the company's approach in a 60 Minutes episode as providing information about the treatment protocol to physicians, since Hythiam does not market the medications directly to consumers. The physicians in the practice of medicine, then prescribe the medications to the patients in need. 11The FDA allows physicians to prescribe all FDA approved medications off label in the practice of medicine. Addiction experts marveled that Peizer was exploiting a nuance and "loophole."



In August 2006, Peizer founded and served as Chairman of the Board of Xcorporeal,Inc., a developer of wearable artificial kidneys, where he presided over the licensing of substantially all of the companies technology to the Dialysis Industry's dominant services provider Fresenius Medical Care for a substantial up front payment and ongoing licensing royalties.
More Details
Hide Details
Many of these companies, including Cray, Hythiam and Xcorporeal became public companies during Peizer's tenure.
 Peizer's investment philosophy was taking shape during these years, which according to Peizer, was to "Invest in situations where you tip the playing field in your favor and Invest in companies with low market caps but with the ability to change the way its industry does things." Peizer applied his financial acumen and structuring expertise to minimize his investment at risk, but allow for exponential returns. This philosophy has served Peizer well, and it also points to his founding of Hythiam and Xcorporeal. Peizer has often stated his hopes that the two companies will change the addiction treatment and kidney dialysis industries, respectively.
 Although there have been no recent attempts to estimate Peizer's wealth, the Los Angeles Times confirmed his net worth at $50 million back in 1994. While discussing the unusual step of Peizer investing his own personal net worth in some investment deals, the paper stated that he "avoids the usual accoutrements of wealth, such as big houses and expensive cars." The reporter also noted that "Peizer still lives in the condo he bought nine years ago, when he came west to sit at Milken's left hand."





2003

Age 44





It was Peizer’s half brother's struggle with addiction that spurred him to found the Prometa treatment program in 2003 and launch Hythiam,Inc.in 2004.
More Details
Hide Details
Peizer capitalized the company with in excess of $170 million in capital. Prometa combines three medications as a treatment for substance dependence, which became known as the Prometa Treatment Protocol. The medications involved are all FDA approved. Combining them for addiction treatment is different from the purposes for which they were individually approved. This is known as prescribing medications for "Off-label" use. More than 31 percent of all prescriptions prescribed by physicians are written for " off-label" use.
 Peizer was successful in getting Hythiam listed on the NASDAQ Global Market Exchange, using a technique Peizer has used many times before and has become Wall Street's leader in: the reverse merger or reverse public offering (RPO). Hythiam's treatment went on to help thousands of patients end their dependence and get better. Peizer and Hythiam caught the addiction industry's eye for not waiting until there was enough scientific "proof" that Hythiam's treatment was truly effective. Subsequent studies have since validated Hythiam's and Peizer's claims.





1999

Age 40





When a press release in 1999 "announced his "resignation" claiming his "objectives have been achieved," the stock dropped 16% on the day of the announcement.
More Details
Hide Details
The stock has drifted further south to $13.50, off 47% from its 52-week high, from Peizer's resignation."



From 1999 through 2002 Peizer was Chairman of the Board of industry leading supercomputer designer and builder Cray, Inc., a Nasdaq Global Market company, and remains its largest beneficial stockholder.

THIRTIES


1997

Age 38





From 1997 to 1999 Peizer worked with Richard B. Hollis to raise funding for Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals through a reverse merger; the company was developing drugs for HIV and other infectious diseases and during that time Peizer became so immersed in the scientific literature about HIV and AIDS and in the market for HIV drugs that colleagues started calling him "Dr. Peizer."

1990

Age 31





In 1990, after being laid off with 5,300 other Drexel employees in the midst of Drexel's liquidation Peizer purchased a minor league basketball team, the Omaha Racers.

Hide Details
After his purchase, the Racers won the CBA Championship and Peizer took that opportunity to sell the team.
 With "Peizer's reputation as one of Milken's sharp-elbowed traders preceding him," Peizer then started his investment company Beachwood Financial and Wendover Financial Corporation before teaming up with Neil Cole. Peizer and Cole went on to capitalize the company Candies, which is the predecessor to today's multibillion-dollar Iconix Brand Group. During Peizer's early investment career, his function for many of these smaller and development stage companies was once described as "lender of almost last resort" but Peizer's investment savvy empowered him to get favorable deals with these companies still in their early developmental stages.





TWENTIES


1985

Age 26





In the spring of 1985,in an effort to remove the competition from the marketplace, Michael Milken recruited the young Peizer as a Senior Vice President of Drexel Burnham Lambert.

Michael Milken immediately anointed Peizer as his "Protege and Lefthand Man," as they shared clients, desk and phone before taking over all of Milken's direct client responsibilities, which made Peizer the most productive in the High Yield Bond department.





1984

Age 25





Peizer's most notable work while at First Boston came in 1984 when Peizerled the restructuring and financing of Ted Turner's insolvent Turner Broadcasting Corporation which specifically capitalized Turner Broadcasting Corp's CNN and WTBS Super Station with $185 Million; thereby saving it from bankruptcy.

1983

Age 24





In 1983 he was recruited by First Boston, where Peizer instantly became the most profitable high yield bond trader.
More Details
Hide Details
He was occasionally referred to as the "Michael Milken of the East Coast", as he provided Drexel Burnham Lambert clients with an alternative to the Milken controlled High Yield Bond market. During his time at First Boston, Peizer led the first financing for a little known reverse merger company, Danaher Inc. Today Danaher is one of America's largest industrial companies.





1980

Age 21





In 1980, at just 20 years old, Peizer was recruited by Robert Rubin of Goldman Sachs from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and was believed to be the youngest associate during that era.

Market Place; No Sales, but Watch the Stock Soar

Wall Street's Terren Peizer is like Woody Allen's Zelig: he shows up in some of the oddest places.A decade ago, Mr. Peizer was Michael R. Milken's left-hand man, and later a star witness against Mr. Milken at his sentencing for securities fraud. In the mid-90's, Mr. Peizer played a small role in the convoluted drama surrounding Towers Financial, the debt-collection-agency-cum-pyramid-scheme founded by Steven Hoffenberg. And he was an investor in several small companies.Now Mr. Peizer has turned up as the president of Hollis-Eden Pharmaceuticals Inc., a fledgling drug company with a stock that has soared 170 percent this year, to $16.75 on Friday. While biotechnology stocks have been making something of a comeback lately, the Nasdaq index of these shares, which includes Hollis-Eden, has risen just 5.7 percent this year.While Hollis-Eden's market value, $112 million, might seem big for a company with no sales, much less earnings, Mr. Peizer is passionate about the prospects for its anti-AIDS drugs, and he is a persuasive salesman. ''This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me,'' he said last week. ''We have something special.''If he is right, ultimately nothing else about Hollis-Eden will matter much. But similar hopes are shared by the investors in many of the hundreds of little biotechnology companies out there, not all of which are quite as quirky as Hollis-Eden -- and only a few of which will probably hit the big time.

Unlike many biotechnology companies, Hollis-Eden has not been vetted by a big brokerage firm that wants to take it public or a big pharmaceutical company that wants to be its partner (though Mr. Peizer hints of a partnership deal ahead). Continue reading the main story

The company was founded in 1994 by Richard B. Hollis, who had worked for several medical companies, and Patrick T. Prendergast, an Irish scientist. Dr. Prendergast had previously financed his research by treating race horses, Mr. Hollis said, adding that he had focused on a ''commercial perspective rather than an academic one, patents awards versus publishing papers.''In its first year and a half in business, Hollis-Eden devoted itself to trying to raise money, according to statements it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In November 1996 it found a big source of $6 million in cash: the Initial Acquisition Corporation, which had gone public in 1995 as a blind pool, Wall Street's shorthand for ''give us the money now, and we'll buy a company to be named later.'' The underwriter was H. J. Meyers, which has a history of regulatory problems.A year ago, Mr. Peizer joined Hollis-Eden. Mr. Peizer, who had at first been interested in investing in the company, spent months checking it out, he said. Meanwhile, the company was looking into Mr. Peizer.''Obviously, someone with as high a profile as Terren, we had to do the same thing,'' Mr. Hollis said. He was comforted by the fact that Mr. Peizer had never been sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission, he said, adding, ''I became very, very comfortable, and very confident in Terren's ability as a businessman and financier.''Mr. Peizer developed his high profile in his 20's, when he became a salesman at the Beverly Hills office of Drexel Burnham Lambert, where he sat next to the man he describes as the Babe Ruth of the bond business. Though he worked with and admired Mr. Milken, he said, he felt compelled to testify against his old boss when he discovered that improper things had been going on, ''and I wouldn't perjure myself, I wouldn't obstruct justice and I wouldn't destroy documents.''

Afterward, Mr. Peizer became a private investor in small companies. He says he has made money in almost all of the roughly 30 companies in which he has invested. Some, like the shoe company now called Candies', are making money; others, like Urethane Technologies, a tire company, have gone bust. ''I shouldn't have left the board,'' he said of Urethane. ''They ran it into the ground.''In 1995, Mr. Peizer had another unpleasant brush with publicity when he was named in a lawsuit filed against John Hall, the man who was supposed to rebuild the remains of Towers Financial, renamed Qualis Care. Instead, Mr. Hall looted the company; he later pleaded guilty to fraud charges.Qualis's creditors complained that the company's money was used to repay a $5 million personal loan Mr. Peizer made to Mr. Hall, who used an additional $5 million of company money to buy stock from Mr. Peizer. Mr. Peizer has asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit against him, saying that he had nothing to do with Mr. Hall's improper activities.

All of these experiences, Mr. Peizer said, have made him leery of ''the limelight, the sour light, the lemon light.'' But he was willing to take the rather public role at Hollis-Eden, he said, because he believed so strongly in the company's drugs.In a press release the company issued last week, it described three ''technology platforms'' it was working on, including a drug called Inactivin, or PPB2, which it said kept viruses from replicating using a different mechanism than current AIDS treatments. The company hopes to begin overseas clinical trials on this drug by the end of March, and to start such tests in the United States before the end of the year.Even so, the company is probably ''a number of years away'' from applying for approval from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Thomas C. Merigan, a prominent AIDS researcher at Stanford University who is on the company's board  and is serving as a consultant to help it set up its clinical trials.As for the run-up in the stock price, he said, ''I don't understand the ways this happens.''Company officials say they are not behind the rise; despite the press release, they have been trying to keep a low profile, they say, and they do not think a brokerage firm is pushing the stock. Indeed, no analysts now cover the company, which plans to hold a ''road show'' for stockbrokers in New York this week.Mr. Hollis and Mr. Peizer suggested that the current boom in trading might have occurred because, in December, early investors who owned millions of shares became free to sell them. But Mr. Peizer and Mr. Hollis own almost half of the company's shares -- Mr. Peizer's first block of stock options just vested -- and say they have not sold any.Nor do they intend to, Mr. Peizer said. ''I would throw myself on the tracks,'' he said, ''if it would help this company.'' Continue reading the main story
