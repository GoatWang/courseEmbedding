NEW YORK, Oct. 31, 2014 /PRNewswire/ — Sound Harbor Partners today announced the closing of Sound Harbor Loan Fund 2014-1, a Collateralized Loan Obligation ("CLO") fund totaling $457 million. The fund invests primarily in USD-denominated senior secured corporate loans. 
The transaction is Sound Harbor's first since reaching a joint arrangement with Macquarie Credit Investment Management Inc. ("Macquarie") to launch a series of CLO funds. J.P Morgan acted as sole lead arranger for the transaction. Including this fund, Sound Harbor manages the SHP Capital Solutions Fund and four CLOs totaling $1.4 billion.
Sound Harbor is led by Michael Zupon and Dean Criares. Mr. Zupon is a former Partner at The Carlyle Group where he founded and led the leveraged finance business. Mr. Criares is a former Partner of The Blackstone Group where he founded and led the loan management business.  
"Achieving a successful initial close under our strategic relationship with Macquarie marks a major milestone," said Mr. Criares. "Our collective intent is to carefully build on this success by delivering attractive returns to all investors. The relationship with Macquarie allows us to consider opportunistic growth plans across various economic cycles and uncertain regulatory environments."
