What is the core mission of the company?

The mission of the company is to acquire and build a balanced portfolio of life sciences assets without typical clinical regulatory timelines. 
 Currently, CannaMed Enterprises, Inc. has two principal businesses: a consumer natural wellness business that includes medicinal (not recreational) cannabis products and non-cannabis-containing dietary supplements, and a synthetic biology platform for industrial cleantech, namely a “wastewater to value” technology. 
 The two businesses provide good balance by sector and by customer type, yet both rely on innovative science, and both have an overall “green” theme. CannaMed Enterprises’ business model includes the acquisition of licenses, equity stakes, rights on both an exclusive and non-exclusive basis, and entire businesses.
 
 
Why focus on the “life sciences” industry?

 CannaMed Enterprises, Inc. believes that some of the best solutions for improved quality of life–whether through improved environment or overall personal health and wellness–can be found by harnessing nature.
 Our supplements are formulated with powerful combinations of natural ingredients, such as amino acids. We also make use of certain cannabinoids in ways that promote healing without narcotic effects. And, our “wastewater to value” technology relies on using specific strains of enhanced bacteria to metabolize organic waste molecules while generating electricity. 
 Moreover, the market opportunity for life science-based products and technologies is enormous, estimated at over $1.5 trillion as of 2012 (Source: Deloitte’s 2014 Global Life Sciences Outlook).

Corporate Overview
We Stand for "Medical" in the Cannabis Industry








 



 CannaMed Enterprises, Inc. takes advantage of its unique understanding of metabolic processes to provide innovative treatment options for unmet medical needs. 
 Cannabis use has an extensive history dating back thousands of years, and currently there are thousands of peer-reviewed scientific publications that document the underlying biochemical pathways that cannabinoids modulate. 
  
 An Inquiring Approach 
 At CannaMed Enterprises, we use an inquiring approach to discover and develop novel cannabinoid-based therapies to improve patients’ lives. From the initiation, our founders have been committed to fostering and maintaining a bold, pioneering spirit fostering the true nature of innovation from which cutting edge ideas flourish and translate into evidence-based solutions. 
 We are dedicated to working closely with local, national and international regulatory agencies to provide access to high quality, first class cannabinoid pharmaceuticals to those critically in need of new treatments for life threatening and debilitating conditions. CannaMed Enterprises’ clinical trial material comes from the cultivation and production facilities that are cGMP compliant, surpassing high quality standard industrial and food processing requirements. 
 The Company works with leading experts in drug development, medicinal characterization, and clinical research to develop, produce, and commercialize novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of multiple critical ailments from cancer and infections to age-related illnesses and neurobehavioral disorders. 
 Our products, broadly described, are medical cannabinoid formulations developed from one or more of the cannabinoid compounds found in the cannabis plant. Our immediate focus is to treat one of the most important diseases in the world, cancer. 
 
 
 


 Basis and Philosophy 
 Cannabis plants have extensive history of medical and agricultural use dating back thousands of years.
To date hundreds of natural constituents covering several chemical classes have been isolated and identified from the Cannabis plant.
Some key Phytocannabinoids are:

 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 
 Cannabidiol (CBD) 
 Cannabigerol (CBG) 
 Cannabichromene (CBC) 
 Cannabinol (CBN)

These cannabinoids belong to the chemical class of terpenophenolics, of which 85 have been uniquely identified in cannabis, including the most psychoactive cannabinoid, THC.
Some applications of cannabinoids have been well established in peer-reviewed literature such as for alleviating nausea and stimulating the appetite for people with AIDS and cancer. Other well-known uses include easing chronic pain and reducing muscle spasms associated with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.
 
 

 The Pharmacology of THC
 The pharmacology of THC has been widely studied, while many other identified cannabinoids are still poorly characterized pharmacologically and biologically, with new activities for cannabinoids consistently being discovered.
 CannaMed Enterprises is developing novel cannabis based approaches to treat the world’s most deadly illnesses. We learn from patients about the healing properties of cannabis medicines. Our immediate focus is the development of cutting edge cancer treatments.
 The Company’s future endeavours include infectious illnesses, neurobehavioral disorders including attention deficit disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder; and an application of the anti-inflammatory activities of cannabis in the management of age-related illnesses. 
While concentrating on our core activities of discovering and developing treatments that will make a meaningful difference in patients’ lives, we remain mindful that we have other responsibilities to the clinicians who utilize our drugs, health authorities around the world, our shareholders, our employees, and the communities in which we live and work. We continually strive to improve our corporate responsibility standards and activities, implementing comprehensive ethical standards and undertaking patient and community progressive initiatives.
 
 
 


 These principles reflect the mission of CannaMed Enterprises to provide innovative therapeutics for unmet medical needs. 
 As the industry leader, CannaMed Enterprises consults and leads other emerging businesses that CannaMed Enterprises believes has a preferred business model, one which will mature into a key business model in the future. Our consulting is on the entire “seed to sale” process with a focus on bio-pharmaceutical development. 
 We feel that the correct way is to look at the industry from a bio-pharmaceutical standpoint, in a manner that allows cannabinoid-based products to modulate the endocannabinoid system to treat multiple conditions. Scientifically, we know this is the beginning of one of the greatest expansions of medicine and industry we will ever experience in our lifetime.

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
