PITTSBURGH, Nov. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Liquid X Printed Metals ®, Inc., (Liquid X®), an advanced material manufacturer of functional metallic inks, today introduced two particle-free inks.  The inks will enable manufacturers in the electronics and other industries to produce thinner, more cost-effective and adaptable electronic components that will drive innovation in consumer electronics, and advanced and medical technology among other industries.
The company's two inaugural products, Liquid X®'s Silver Inkjet Ink and Silver Flexo Ink were developed using an original and proprietary particle-free formulation that leads to more cost-effective and trouble-free processing; more durable traces that withstand bending and flexing; adherence to the full range of substrates; good conductivity; excellent printability; and enhanced sustainability due to its water-based composition.
"Liquid X® is introducing particle-free inks that eliminate problems associated with other metallic inks that are made with less stable nanoparticles or metal flakes, which are thicker and can cause clogging, slowness and other problems in printing," said Greg Babe, President and CEO of Liquid X®.  "Our Silver Inkjet Ink and Silver Flexo Ink leverage atomic-level technology, which represents the kind of powerful, robust and adaptable innovation required to tap the fullest potential of printed electronics."
Liquid X®'s molecular inks consist of novel metal complexes that are printed as solutions that are used in the creation of films or traces that exhibit high conductivity, are thin and precise, and allow for low-temperature processing that enables adherence on a wide range of substrates. And the low viscosity of the inks allow for use in printing methods that include inkjet, aerosol jet, flexography, and gravure.  
Liquid X®'s conductive inks are designed for applications that range from transparent conductors and touchscreens, to photovoltaic, industrial and automotive applications, and smart packaging.
Performance
Silver Inkjet Ink features viscosity at 6-9 cPs; Polar Protic Solvents; thermal, photonic and infrared curing methods; adherence to all substrates; and excellent stability when refrigerated. Film trace sheet resistance for one layer is 0.5 – 1 ohms per square.  Thickness for one layer is 200-300 nm.  Trace width is < 50 micrometers.  (Adhesion, tensile - ASTM D3359, 5B rating).  (Adhesion shear - scrub resistant.)  [Gloss - ASTM D523 ISO 2813, At 60 degrees >70 Gloss Units (high gloss)]
Silver Flexo Ink features Flexo-Gravure deposition; viscosity at 110-140 cPs (1-50 RPM); 80-110 (60-100 RPM); ~25 sec #2 Zahn Cup;  Polar Protic Solvents; thermal, photonic and infrared curing methods; adherence to all substrates; and excellent stability at room temperature or when refrigerated. Film trace sheet resistance for one layer is 0.5 – 1 ohms per square.  Thickness is 1-3 microns.  (dependent on anilox).   (Adhesion, tensile - ASTM D3359, 5B rating).  (Adhesion shear - scrub resistant.)  [Gloss - ASTM D523 ISO 2813, At 60 degrees >70 Gloss Units (high gloss)]
In development is a product called Silver Stretchable Ink, which is designed for stretchable substrates such as fabrics or elastomers.  Applications for Silver Stretchable Ink include wearables, soft robotics and other customized applications.

A Carnegie Mellon University spinout led by former Bayer Corp. CEO Gregory Babe has raised $1.24 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Babe confirmed the financing round and said Liquid X Printed Metals Inc. could raise as much as $1.36 million.
Babe didn't identify the investors but said there were no new ones in the round.

Past investors Innovation Works and William Newlin, chairman of Sewickley-based Newlin Investment Co., who serves on the Liquid X board, confirmed that they participated in the new round.




"The money will be used to move the company from product development to the commercial stage, in other words dealing directly with the large number of potential customers who are interested in our products,” Newlin said.
Harmar-based Liquid X developed a metallic conductive ink technology that allows the printing of metal traces and films onto a number of applications, including medical devices, consumer electronics and solar panels. Last November, the young company introduced two particle-free inks enabling manufacturers to produce thinner, more cost-effective and adaptable electronic components.
"It's an interesting technology, and we're on the cutting edge of printed electronics," Babe said. "At this point, the industry is limited more by the imagination of the designer and by really reliable products. The ink we manufacture can make all of this work, and it's going to be an exciting space over the next decade."
Babe became president and CEO at Liquid X in 2013, a year after retiring from Bayer, where he had built a three-decade-long career. He said the excitement of being at a startup and the growth potential of the industry sector attracted him to the company.




 


He said ink technology is "probably a $2 billion industry today," but could grow to $30 billion in the next decade.
"The market is in its infancy, so the areas we believe our technology can be used most effectively are in next-generation solar panels and in wearables — Fitbits and sensors that go into clothing or shoes," Babe said. "It could be wearable medical devices."

Still, it's a change for the long-time corporate veteran.
"I went to six (employees) from 1,600," he said.
Babe said Liquid X could hire this year, but he declined to say how many posts.
Since its 2010 launch, Liquid X has been connected to other big names in Pittsburgh business circles.
Co-founder Richard McCullough, who is the young company’s executive chairman as well as vice provost for research at Harvard University, is a former CMU dean of science. McCullough also founded Plextronics Inc., which developed customized inks that enhanced the performance of organic light emitting diodes. Former Plextronics CEO Andrew Hannah was an early board member at Liquid X but said Tuesday he stepped down to concentrate on his new startup OThot LLC.

New & Old
Posterjack launched our classic Metal Prints to the market in 2011 as the first company in America to offer Metal Prints online and we have never looked back.  Our Metal Prints have graced home décor magazines and countless photo exhibitions alike.

Customize Your Image
Sometimes a photo needs a little help to get it looking just the way you want. When you upload a photo, you have the option to crop the image so it’s perfectly composed, add a border choosing from a large variety of different colours and sizes, or even add a creative effect to your photo. Effects options include Black and White, Sepia Toning, Charcoal Sketch, Linocut, Solarize, and Pop-Art. Have fun and see what each effect looks like – if you don’t like it, simply click on Original Colour and your photo goes back to how it was before you started.

Where does Posterjack ship to?
We ship our products to anywhere in America. At this time, we are unable to ship outside of the country. All of our products are shipped via FedEx. 
            
How much does shipping cost?
Our standard shipping rate is $9.99. This is a flat rate and applies to your entire order, regardless of the product, quantity, or size. Due to the higher costs of delivering to rural areas, a rural delivery surcharge of $20 is applied to remote addresses. If this surcharge is applicable to your order, you will be notified after you enter your postal code during the checkout process. We offer free shipping on all orders over $150.

Can you guarantee my HD Metal Print will arrive in good condition? 
All orders are packaged with our time-tested, super-tough packaging materials. That said, accidents can happen and if your order does get damaged during shipping, you will be completely covered as all of our shipments are fully insured.
            
How long does it take to produce my HD Metal Print?
Posterjack HD Metal Prints take approximately 5-10 business days to produce. Please note that this is an average time. Because each piece of art is a custom product, production times can vary slightly. 
            
How long will it take for my order to arrive?
As soon as your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number. Shipping times vary depending on which part of America you live in but the estimated time for most major Canadian cities is three days. For an additional fee, we can also ship your order via FedEx Priority Overnight. Local Toronto pick-up is also an option at no cost. For more information, please visit our Production & Shipping Page.
            


Free image quality check
When you upload a photo to Posterjack.ca, the very first thing we do is take a look at your image resolution, compare it with your chosen print size, and then provide you with a quality score which can be seen immediately after uploading your photo. This free image quality check only takes seconds but ensures you’ll be happy with your Canvas Print – no more second-guessing as to whether or not your photo is suitable for printing in a large format. If your quality score isn’t as high as you would like it to be, you can try switching to a smaller print size. If your quality score is unsuitable, you will not be able to proceed through the checkout process as print results will not meet our high standards and will be considered unacceptable. In this case, please choose either a smaller print size or a photo with a higher resolution. Please feel free to contact customer support for additional help. 

            
What type of file should I upload?
          We process the four most common image types. All digital cameras and graphic design programs will produce at least one of these file types. The types we accept are JPEG, TIFF, BMP, & PNG. Our preferred file type is JPEG, which produces excellent print results and efficient file sizes! If your image is in a different format, please save it as one of the above formats before submitting to us. 

Your digital camera produces images in a colour space we support – typically sRGB. If you prefer, you can also upload images in Adobe RGB or any other popular RGB Colour Profile. Please do not upload images in the CMYK colour space - colour shifting is likely to occur.
How large of a file can I upload?
You can upload files up to 50 MB in size. If your image is larger than 50 MB, check to ensure it has been saved as a JPEG (TIFF files are generally a lot larger than JPEGs with no real advantage for print quality).  

There is also an image resolution limit of 80 megapixels (MP). Mega is a prefix for one million, meaning your image can have up to eighty million pixels. That’s a huge amount! In fact, even the highest end cameras don’t take images that large. So you can be sure this is more than enough resolution to create excellent prints at any of our sizes. To calculate the megapixels of your image, you only need to know the pixel dimensions of your image and plug them into this simple formula: (pixel width * pixel height) / 1,000,000 = MP.  

If you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact us – we’re happy to help!   

            
Your print sizes are listed under aspect ratio categories. What is an “aspect ratio”? 
The “aspect ratio” of a photo, in its simplest terms, refers to the rectangle size of the image. Photos can be taken as long panoramic rectangles, shorter rectangles, squares, and anything in between. The “aspect ratio” measurement is a technical way of expressing the exact rectangle size for a photo or image. This is expressed as the relative length of the long edge of the image, compared to the short edge.  Here is an infographic to help explain! 





What is an HD Metal Print?
 An HD Metal Print is a premium Metal Print.  We create this Metal Print using Dye Sublimation Printers, a heat press and Chromaluxe Metal Panels. The result is a finished product like nothing else on the market.  The desirable characteristics of an HD Metal Print are the vivid colours, glossy surface, and durable nature of the product. 
                    
How will the colours turn out on my Metal Print?
The colours on an HD Metal Print will remain true to your original image.  Because we are pressing the image onto the Metal Panel, there are many variables that may cause a slight alteration in colour.  The process of the heat alters the white point of the panel slightly, which shifts the background colour slightly yellow.  Please note that while the resulting colour of a Metal Print is excellent, it  will not be as accurate as a direct print to a paper surface, such as our Poster Prints or Fine Art Prints.

                    
Are there any imperfections in the surface of Metal Prints?
Our HD Metal Print panels are sourced from Chromaluxe, the inventor and leader in Metal Printing.  In the process of making the panels, Chromaluxe coats the bare aluminum sheets in a state of the art facility in the USA.  The top coating is what your image is infused into. The coating typically contains some minor imperfections, meaning the surface might have a very small dot, pit, or bubble.  These minor imperfections are a part of the product and do not detract from the finished product.  We will not reprint images due to these imperfections.

                    
Is bare metal visible on HD Metal Prints?
No, our HD Metal Prints are made out of metal, but there is a white coating on the surface.  Because of this white coating, the metal is not visible in the print.  If you are looking for the effect where you see metal coming through in the image, please try our Classic Metal Prints on brushed Aluminum.

                    
Do black and white photos look good printed on metal?
Absolutely! Black and white images look amazing when they’re made into HD Metal Prints! While black and white images look great, HD Metal Prints are generally made in full colour to take advantage of the wide colour gamut.

                    
Will my photo be cropped?
After your photo is printed onto a large metal sheet, our specialized machinery will cut one eighth (1/8) of an inch from the perimeter of the photo. For this reason, we do not recommend placing any logos, watermarks, or other text at the very edge of your image.

Please note that while the resulting colour of a Metal Print is excellent, it  will not be as accurate as a direct print to a paper surface, such as our Poster Prints or Fine Art Prints.

                    
Are there any imperfections in the surface of Metal Prints?
Our HD Metal Print panels are sourced from Chromaluxe, the inventor and leader in Metal Printing.  In the process of making the panels, Chromaluxe coats the bare aluminum sheets in a state of the art facility in the USA.  The top coating is what your image is infused into. The coating typically contains some minor imperfections, meaning the surface might have a very small dot, pit, or bubble.  These minor imperfections are a part of the product and do not detract from the finished product.  We will not reprint images due to these imperfections.

                    
Is bare metal visible on HD Metal Prints?
No, our HD Metal Prints are made out of metal, but there is a white coating on the surface.  Because of this white coating, the metal is not visible in the print.  If you are looking for the effect where you see metal coming through in the image, please try our Classic Metal Prints on brushed Aluminum.

                    
Do black and white photos look good printed on metal?
Absolutely! Black and white images look amazing when they’re made into HD Metal Prints! While black and white images look great, HD Metal Prints are generally made in full colour to take advantage of the wide colour gamut.

                    
Will my photo be cropped?
After your photo is printed onto a large metal sheet, our specialized machinery will cut one eighth (1/8) of an inch from the perimeter of the photo. For this reason, we do not recommend placing any logos, watermarks, or other text at the very edge of your image.

Get the Wow-Factor with Acrylic Prints
Seeing your photo on an Acrylic Print is an eye-popping experience. The combination of super-vivid printing, professional-quality materials, and the depth and details of your photo creates a truly magical effect. In fact, of all our Photo Art products, a Posterjack Acrylic Print is the one that will make your photo really stand out. 
            
It's all in the Details
Posterjack Acrylic Prints are best-in-class and it’s the details that really make us shine. We’ve refined our Acrylic Prints to match the quality of the very best photo ateliers in Europe, making sure that each and every detail is absolute perfection. Every Acrylic Print is made with thick, ¼-inch, 99.9% optically-pure acrylic. We protect the backside of the print with a white stability board for extra longevity and protection against moisture and handling. We even go the extra mile by polishing the edges to a crystal-clear sheen so that light refracts from the edges, resulting in a seamless image reflection from face to edge. Words don’t do it justice – you’ve got to see it for yourself!   
Hanging Options to Suit Your Décor
When you have your photo made into an Acrylic Print, you are provided with a choice of two great hanging options. Our Standoff Kit will lend an industrial look to your print that’s perfect for those who like to create that edgy décor style. Or, for a super-clean look and feel, our sleek Float Mount System is completely hidden when your Acrylic Print is on the wall. For smaller print sizes, we also offer a smart-looking easel that’s great for placing your Photo Art on a desk or table.
            
Photo Presentation Perfected
If you want to display your photos just like the world’s leading photo art galleries, a Posterjack Acrylic Print is the perfect choice. We’ve won over many of America’s leading gallery owners, art aficionados, and professional photographers. We are super-excited to see how much love this product is receiving and can’t wait to create one just for you! 
            



Displaying Your Acrylic Print

               We offer a choice of two great hanging options. Our popular Float Mount System is ideal for those who like a sleek, clean, and unframed look, or, if you prefer your Photo Art to have a bold, industrial feel to it, you’ll love our Standoff Kit. Please note that you can select your preferred hanging option after you upload your photo.

Customize Your Image
Sometimes a photo needs a little help to get it looking just the way you want. When you upload a photo, you have the option to crop the image so it’s perfectly composed, add a border choosing from a large variety of different colors and sizes, or even add a creative effect to your photo. Effects options include Black & White, Sepia Tone, Solarize, Pop Art, Charcoal Sketch, and Linocut. Have fun and see what each effect looks like – if you don’t like it, simply click on Original Color and your photo goes back to how it was before you started.

Where does Posterjack ship to?
We ship our products anywhere in the USA. All of our products are shipped via FedEx.
            
How much does shipping cost?
Our standard shipping rate is $9.99. This is a flat rate and applies to your entire order, regardless of the product, quantity, or size. We offer free shipping on all orders over $150.
            
Can you guarantee my Acrylic Print will arrive in good condition?
All orders are packaged with our time-tested, super-tough packaging materials. That said, accidents do happen and if your order does get damaged during shipping, you will be completely covered as all of our shipments are fully insured.
            
How long does it take you to produce my Acrylic Print?
Posterjack Acrylic Prints take approximately 8-12 business days to produce. Please note that this is an average time. Because each piece of art is a custom product, production times can vary slightly. 
            
How long will it take for my order to arrive?
Shipping times vary depending on which part of the country you live in. As soon as your order is shipped, you will receive an email with a tracking number so you can monitor the progress of your shipment online. For more information, please visit our Production & Shipping page.
            


Free image quality check
When you upload a photo to Posterjack, the very first thing we do is take a look at your image resolution, compare it with your chosen print size, and then provide you with a quality score which can be seen immediately after uploading your photo. This free image quality check only takes seconds but ensures you’ll be happy with your Acrylic Print – no more second-guessing as to whether or not your photo is suitable for printing in a large format. If your quality score isn’t as high as you would like it to be, you can try switching to a smaller print size. If your quality score is unsuitable, you will not be able to proceed through the checkout process as print results will not meet our high standards and will be considered unacceptable. In this case, please choose either a smaller print size or a photo with a higher resolution. Please feel free to contact customer support for additional help. 

            
What type of file should I upload?
We process the four most common image types. All digital cameras and graphic design programs will produce at least one of these file types. The types we accept are JPEG, TIFF, BMP, & PNG. Our preferred file type is JPEG, which produces excellent print results and efficient file sizes! If your image is in a different format, please save it as one of the above formats before submitting to us.  

If you aren't a big color geek, don't worry, your camera produces images in a color space we can handle (typically sRGB). If you prefer you can also upload images in Adobe RGB, or any other popular RGB Color Profile. Please do not upload images in the CMYK color space.


How large of a file can I upload?
You can upload files up to 50 MB in size. Should your images be larger than 50 MB, the best place to start would be checking they are saved in JPEG format (TIFF's generally produce larger file sizes, at no real advantage for print quality). If you need further assistance with file sizing, please contact us for details.  

            
Your print sizes are listed under aspect ratio categories. What is an “aspect ratio”? 
The “aspect ratio” of a photo, in its simplest terms, refers to the rectangle size of the image. Photos can be taken as long panoramic rectangles, shorter rectangles, squares, and anything in between. The “aspect ratio” measurement is a technical way of expressing the exact rectangle size for a photo or image. This is expressed as the relative length of the long edge of the image, compared to the short edge.  Here is an infographic to help explain! 





What is an Acrylic Print?
 A Posterjack Acrylic Print is a modern and fresh way to display your photos. The look is very clean and simple, which puts the focus on the quality of the product. We reverse the photo and print directly onto the back of a piece of ¼-inch, 99.9% optically-pure acrylic. Next, we seal in the print and add opacity by printing a flood coat of white behind it. 

How does an Acrylic Print compare to an Acrylic Face Mount?
An Acrylic Face Mount is an older method of making acrylic art which requires printing the photo onto paper, and then adhering the face of the print onto the back of an acrylic. Here’s a chart to help you better understand the differences: 



Posterjack Acrylic Print
Facemount Acrylic


Your photo is mirrored then printed directly onto the acrylic. No glue or adhesive is used and the result is 100% optically pure. 
Your photo is printed on paper, then the face of the print is adhered to the back of the acrylic.  Depending on the quality of adhesive, the product may last a number of years, but eventual peeling and delamination will occur.



We seal the back of the print with white ink infused with titanium for an extremely durable finish. 
The back of the print is made of photo paper, resulting in a product that is easily damaged by scratches, gouges, water, etc.


Our Acrylic Prints are suitable for use in humid and damp conditions. Yes, they can be hung in a bathroom!
Face Mounted Acrylic will be destroyed if exposed to humidity as the paper will absorb the moisture and start to bubble.


Will my photo go right to the edge of the acrylic?
Yes. When we print your photo on the acrylic, the image goes to the very edge of the sheet. Posterjack Acrylic Prints have a laser polished edge, so you can see the colors shining through the edge of the print, which is an amazing feature. Take a look at our product shots in the viewer above to get a close look at the polished edge and borderless printing!

Poster Prints or Photo Enlargements?
People often ask us whether we specialize in poster printing or photo enlargements. The answer is both. The word poster simply means that we print things in a large format. Our world-class photo printers mean that no matter what image we print, we always produce top quality products. 
            
The Fine Print
It’s all about the details when it comes to photo enlargements. Why do Posterjack’s prints look so darn good? For a number of reasons, in fact. Back in 2006, we invented proprietary software that helps retain a photo’s details when enlarged, keeping it looking spectacularly vibrant and sharp when printed poster-sized. By reinvesting in research and development, we remain the leader for online photo printing services. In addition to our unique software, we also use the world’s most advanced printers – 19,896 little nozzles are used to print each and every detail within your photo.  
            
But What About the Paper?
Our super-smooth and perfectly weighted 250gsm photo paper is imported from Germany and is made by Felix Schoeller, the global leader in photo imaging and décor papers. Even better, the paper we use comes exclusively from PEFC-certified renewable forests. This superior paper, combined with our vibrant HP inks, means your posters and photo enlargements will not fade for 200 years.
            
Expect the Best
As we believe in putting quality first, you can expect outstanding results when you order a poster from us. So, what are you waiting for? Let Posterjack turn your photos into art!  
            



Customize Your Image
Sometimes a photo needs a little help to get it looking just the way you want. When you upload a photo, you have the option to crop the image so it’s perfectly composed, add a border choosing from a large variety of different colors and sizes, or even add a creative effect to your photo. Effects options include Black and White, Sepia Toning, Charcoal Sketch, Linocut, Solarize, and Pop-Art. Have fun and see what each effect looks like – if you don’t like it, simply click on Original Color and your photo goes back to how it was before you started.
