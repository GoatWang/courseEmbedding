Trian Partners Nominates Four Highly Qualified Candidates for 
      Election to DuPont Board




Referendum On Performance


DuPont Board Has Not Held Management Accountable For 
      Repeatedly Missing Promised Revenue And Earnings Targets


Newly Revealed Poor Corporate Governance At Chemours Shows Board 
      Disconnect From DuPont Stockholders








January 08, 2015 06:45 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Trian Fund Management, L.P. (“Trian”), one of the largest stockholders 
      of E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company (NYSE: DD) (“DuPont”), announced 
      today that it has nominated four highly qualified candidates for 
      election to the DuPont Board of Directors at the 2015 Annual Meeting of 
      Stockholders. Investment funds managed by Trian currently beneficially 
      own an aggregate of approximately 24.4 million DuPont shares valued at 
      approximately $1.8 billion.
    

      Trian believes long-term success requires each of DuPont’s business 
      segments to achieve best-in-class operating metrics. Despite 
      management’s rhetoric about the value of “integrated science,” the 
      reality is that DuPont is struggling operationally: 1) earnings per 
      share are down since 2011; 2) organic revenue growth and margins have 
      underperformed peers in five of the Company’s seven segments; and 3) 
      management has lowered and/or missed its own guidance to Wall Street for 
      the third year in a row while consistently failing to achieve the 
      revenue and margin targets presented at DuPont’s 2011 Investor Day.
    

      Trian believes the DuPont Board has not held management accountable for 
      continuing underperformance and repeated failures to deliver publicly 
      stated revenue and earnings targets. In addition, Trian believes the 
      DuPont Board’s recent decision to spin-off Chemours, its Performance 
      Chemicals segment, with poor corporate governance and punitive 
      anti-takeover measures -- including a classified board, no stockholder 
      action by written consent, an 80% supermajority vote required for 
      stockholders to amend Chemours’ by-laws or certain provisions of its 
      certificate of incorporation (including those relating to the election, 
      classification and nomination of directors), and a high 35% threshold of 
      stockholders to call a special meeting -- shows a disconnect from 
      stockholders. Trian believes it is time for new perspectives and robust 
      oversight from the DuPont Board. Trian is therefore nominating a 
      minority slate of four directors with extensive operating, strategic and 
      financial experience and a history of generating long-term shareholder 
      value to work with the continuing directors to achieve the great 
      potential of this iconic company.
    

      Trian’s four highly qualified director nominees are:
    


        Nelson Peltz, Chief Executive Officer and a Founding Partner of Trian 
        and a director of Mondelēz International, Inc., The Wendy’s Company 
        and The Madison Square Garden Company
      

        John H. Myers, former President and Chief Executive Officer of GE 
        Asset Management and currently a director of Legg Mason, Inc.
      

        Arthur B. Winkleblack, former Executive Vice President and Chief 
        Financial Officer of H.J. Heinz Company and currently a director of 
        RTI International Metals, Inc. and Church & Dwight Co., Inc.
      

        Robert J. Zatta, Acting Chief Executive Officer and long-time Chief 
        Financial Officer of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., a leading global 
        developer, manufacturer, and marketer of specialty chemicals
      


      In a letter to DuPont’s Board on September 16, 2014, a copy of which 
      will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 9, 
      2015, Trian outlined five reasons for DuPont’s persistent 
      underperformance: 1) excessive holding company costs; 2) overwhelming 
      complexity; 3) bureaucracy and a lack of management accountability; 4) 
      inefficient capital structure; and 5) a persistent conglomerate discount 
      to its share price. In the letter, Trian proposed a separation of DuPont 
      into GrowthCo (Agriculture, Nutrition and Health, Industrial 
      Biosciences) and CyclicalCo/CashCo (Performance Materials, Safety and 
      Protection, Electronics and Communications), in addition to separating 
      Performance Chemicals.
    

      Trian views a separation as a means to an end:
    


        Elimination of an entire layer of corporate overhead
      

        Elimination of corporate bureaucracy in order to empower management, 
        assure accountability, speed decision making, create focus and reduce 
        complexity
      

        Catalyst for a “clean slate” to design the ideal cost structure 
        through “zero-based budgeting”
      

        More accountability on returns on research and development
      

        High probability of valuation multiple re-rating
      


      Trian believes a separation would greatly increase the likelihood that 
      the individual businesses will eliminate the operational gap versus 
      peers. The substantial increase in profitability at Axalta Coatings 
      Systems (DuPont’s former Performance Coatings business) following its 
      sale to a private equity firm in 2013, as detailed in Trian’s September 
      16, 2014 letter, is a powerful example of the benefits of focus and the 
      excessive costs incurred by DuPont. Nevertheless, Trian does not intend 
      this election to be a referendum on separating the businesses, but 
      rather a referendum on DuPont’s performance. If elected to the Board, 
      the Trian nominees will seek to work collaboratively with the other 
      Board members to determine whether value can be optimized in the current 
      structure or through a separation.
    

      DuPont is one of Trian’s largest investments. Trian has a strong vested 
      interest in DuPont’s future and takes pride in its reputation as a 
      long-term shareholder with a history of designing and implementing 
      value-added strategic and operating initiatives at many companies. Trian 
      has been patient, giving management more than a year and a half to prove 
      it could achieve its publicly stated financial goals. Trian believes all 
      stockholders will benefit from the election of Trian’s nominees who will 
      stimulate robust dialogue and enhanced engagement in the board room.
    

Trian’s Director NomineesBiographies for each nominee 
      follow:
    

Nelson Peltz has served as Chief Executive Officer and a founding 
      partner of Trian, an asset management company for various investment 
      funds and accounts, since its formation in 2005. Mr. Peltz has served as 
      a director of The Wendy’s Company, the second-largest quick-service 
      hamburger company in North America, since 1993 and non-executive 
      Chairman since 2007. Mr. Peltz has also served as a director of Mondelēz 
      International, Inc., a global snacking powerhouse, since January 2014, 
      and as a director of The Madison Square Garden Company, a sports, 
      entertainment and media company, since December 2014. Mr. Peltz served 
      on the board of directors of Ingersoll-Rand plc, a global diversified 
      industrial company, from 2012 to June 2014. From 2006 until June 2013, 
      Mr. Peltz served as a director of H.J. Heinz Company. From 2009 until 
      December 2014, Mr. Peltz served as a director of Legg Mason, Inc. and 
      served as Chair of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee 
      from 2013 until December 2014.
    

      From 1993 until 2007, Mr. Peltz was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
      of Triarc Companies, Inc. (now known as The Wendy’s Company), which, 
      during that period, owned Arby's Restaurant Group, Inc. and Snapple 
      Beverage Group, as well as other consumer and industrial businesses. He 
      was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and a director of Triangle 
      Industries, Inc., from 1983 until December 1988, when it was acquired by 
      Pechiney, S.A., a leading international metals and packaging company. At 
      the time of its acquisition, Triangle was a Fortune 100 industrial 
      company, which through its subsidiaries, was a manufacturer of packaging 
      products (through American National Can Company), copper electrical wire 
      and cable and steel conduit and currency and coin handling products. 
      From 2003 to 2006, Peltz served as a director of Encore Capital Group, 
      Inc., a leading provider of debt management and recovery solutions. From 
      1996 to 1999, he was Chairman of the Board of National Propane 
      Corporation, the managing general partner of National Propane Partners, 
      L.P., a distributor of liquefied petroleum gas which was sold to the 
      Columbia Energy Group. From 1984 until 1992, he was Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer and a director of Avery, Inc. which, from 1986 to 
      1989, was primarily engaged in the manufacture and sale of specialty 
      chemicals through Uniroyal Chemical, which was sold in a management 
      buyout. Mr. Peltz began his business career in 1963 when he joined his 
      family food business.
    

      Through Mr. Peltz’s 40 years of experience in investing, turning around 
      and building companies, he has developed strong operating experience and 
      strategic planning skills that will benefit DuPont’s operational 
      initiatives and its long-term strategy. Trian believes the attributes, 
      skills and qualifications that Mr. Peltz possesses through his 
      experience as a hands-on executive and active board member on numerous 
      boards will provide DuPont and its Board with valuable industry 
      knowledge and management experience.
    

John H. Myers is the former President and Chief Executive Officer 
      of GE Asset Management, an institutional asset management subsidiary of 
      General Electric Company, who spent almost a decade in that role and a 
      total of over 35 years in various management positions at General 
      Electric. At GE Asset Management, Mr. Myers was responsible for 
      approximately $200 billion in assets under management for clients 
      including General Electric’s pension funds, 401(k) plans, mutual funds 
      and insurance companies, as well as for more than 200 external 
      institutional clients.
    

      Mr. Myers has served as a director of Legg Mason, Inc. since June 2013 
      and served as a director of Hilton Hotels Corporation, a leading global 
      hospitality company, from 2000 to 2007.
    

      Trian believes Mr. Myers’ qualifications to serve on DuPont’s Board 
      include the knowledge and experience he has gained while serving in 
      various management positions for over 35 years with General Electric. In 
      addition, he gained extensive financial and leadership experience 
      serving as President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Asset Management 
      and through his experience as a director of Legg Mason, Inc. and as a 
      former director of Hilton Hotels Corporation.
    

Arthur B. Winkleblack was Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Financial Officer of H.J. Heinz Company, a global packaged food 
      manufacturer, from 2002 until June 2013, where he worked to implement 
      the strategic initiatives required to transform the company into a more 
      streamlined and focused business and leverage the company’s world-class 
      portfolio of powerful brands. Mr. Winkleblack currently serves on the 
      Board of Directors of Church & Dwight Co., Inc., a major manufacturer of 
      household products such as Arm & Hammer, which he joined in 2008, and 
      RTI International Metals, Inc., a leading vertically integrated global 
      supplier of advanced titanium and specialty metal products, which he 
      joined in December 2013. In addition, Mr. Winkleblack has held senior 
      finance positions at C. Dean Metropoulos & Co., the consumer products 
      arm of Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst, a private equity firm, from 1998 
      until 1999, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, the world's largest 
      regional theme park company, from 1996 until 1998, AlliedSignal, Inc., 
      which has since merged with Honeywell International, Inc., a 
      multinational conglomerate that produced a variety of commercial and 
      consumer products, engineering services and aerospace systems, from 1994 
      until 1996 and PepsiCo, Inc., a multinational food and beverage 
      corporation, from 1982 until 1994.
    

      Trian believes Mr. Winkleblack’s substantial executive experience, 
      including more than 10 years of service as Executive Vice President and 
      Chief Financial Officer of H.J. Heinz Company, provides him with 
      knowledgeable perspectives on strategic planning, international 
      operations, acquisitions and divestitures and cost and financial 
      controls. In addition, his experience as CFO of a large multinational 
      company will enable him to bring important perspectives to the Board on 
      compliance, risk management and public reporting.
    

Robert J. Zatta has been acting Chief Executive Officer of 
      Rockwood Holdings, Inc., a leading global developer, manufacturer and 
      marketer of specialty chemicals, since July 2014, and has served as 
      Chief Financial Officer since April 2001. Mr. Zatta was instrumental in 
      leading the turnaround and transformation of Rockwood Holdings, Inc., 
      which resulted in its pending acquisition by Albemarle Corporation in a 
      transaction expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. Prior to 
      joining Rockwood, Mr. Zatta spent 12 years with the Campbell Soup 
      Company, where he held several significant financial management 
      positions, most recently Vice President responsible for Corporate 
      Development and Strategic Planning. Prior to joining Campbell Soup 
      Company in 1990, he worked for General Foods Corporation and Thomas J. 
      Lipton, Inc.
    

      Trian believes Mr. Zatta’s extensive experience in the specialty 
      chemical sector will allow him to bring valuable industry experience to 
      the DuPont Board. In addition, Trian believes that DuPont’s Board will 
      benefit from Mr. Zatta’s expertise in operations, strategic planning, 
      cost and financial controls and public company reporting, which he has 
      developed through his experience as a senior executive at several global 
      companies.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
