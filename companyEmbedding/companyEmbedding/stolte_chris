            About
          

            Leadership
          



    Board members Chris Stolte, Pat Hanrahan and Christian Chabot founded Tableau with a simple mission: help people see and understand their data. Our world-class leaders have the ingredients to deliver on that mission. Along with our entire Board of Directors, their passion, experience and dedication make Tableau a great place to work. And they love working with customers.
  














Adam Selipsky

  Tableau helps people see and understand data



 








    A mission that matters
  

    We help people see and understand their data. Eight words that drive everything we do. And they’ve never been more important.
  

    In 2020 the world will generate 50 times the amount of data as in 2011 and 75 times the number of information sources (IDC, 2011). Within these data are huge opportunities for human advancement. But to turn opportunities into reality, people need the power of data at their fingertips. Tableau is building software to deliver exactly that.
  

    Our products are transforming the way people use data to solve problems. We make analyzing data fast and easy, beautiful and useful. It’s software for anyone and everyone.
  

    We are Tableau Software.
  
 











          It began with three guys from Stanford
        

          It started with a brilliant computer scientist, an Academy-Award winning professor and a savvy business leader with a passion for data. They came together to solve one of the most challenging problems in software – making data understandable to ordinary people. These were the fundamental ingredients for Tableau.

            Chris Stolte
Co-founder and Technical Advisor



The Catalyst?

            A Department of Defense (DOD) project aimed at increasing people’s ability to analyze information. Brought to the Stanford University Computer Science department, the project took flight with Chris Stolte. Stolte, then a Ph.D. candidate, was researching visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes. His early career as a database programmer helped him see the problems with existing data analysis tools. Hungering for a project to change the world, he knew this was it.
          

Whenever I helped people get direct access to data, they were shocked and grateful. I’ve never forgotten that.









            Pat Hanrahan
Tableau’s Chief Scientist and Co-founder



The mind behind Pixar

            The mind behind Pixar, and Stolte’s Ph.D. advisor, Professor Pat Hanrahan realized too it was a project that could change the world. A founding member of Pixar and chief architect for RenderMan, Pat had already transformed the world of animated film.
          

We create pictures that answer questions, but we do it for businesses that want to know things about their data.


            Chris, Pat and a team of Stanford Ph.D.s realized that computer graphics could deliver huge gains in people’s ability to understand data. The breakthrough arose when they brought together two computer science disciplines for the first time: computer graphics and databases. Their invention VizQL™ let people analyze data just by building drag & drop pictures of what they wanted to see.
          








            Christian Chabot
Co-founder and Chairman



“I see the future”

            “I see the future” was Christian Chabot’s reaction when he saw what they invented. Chabot had spent years analyzing data before studying entrepreneurship at Stanford Business School. Together, Christian, Chris and Pat formed a company and spun out of Stanford in 2003. With Christian on board as CEO, Tableau rapidly hit one success after another: first customers, multiple awards, international expansion, the first million in revenue, multiple new inventions. Tableau is revolutionizing business analytics. And this is only the beginning.
          

We’ve become a democratizing force in one of the world’s greatest areas of need.

















          Breakthrough after breakthrough
        



          It’s not enough to be on a mission that matters. You must have the ideas and technologies to match. We do.

VizQL


Live Query Engine


In-Memory Data Engine




VizQL™

Natively visual, naturally faster

            VizQL is a visual query language that translates drag-and-drop actions into data queries and then expresses that data visually. VizQL delivers dramatic gains in people’s ability to see and understand data by abstracting the underlying complexities of query and analysis. The result is an intuitive user experience that lets people answer questions as fast as they can think of them. We believe that VizQL represents a foundational advancement in the area of data analysis and visualization.
          

            Don’t take our word for it. Jim Gray, a Turing Award winner and a legendary figure in the field of databases, wrote about VizQL in a research highlight: “If you have ever been frustrated when trying to plot a useful graph from a simple spreadsheet, you would appreciate the value of a system that allows users to create stunning graphs interactively and easily from large multidimensional datasets.” High praise from one of the greatest minds of computer science.
          








Live Query Engine

Data in your hands

            Tableau’s Live Query Engine is the first technology to let people natively query databases, cubes, warehouses, Cloud sources, even Hadoop, without any programming or advance development. It lets people query diverse data sources with a point-and-click interface anyone can use.
          

            People connect to data of any size with a few clicks. Layer in additional data sources on the fly. Connecting to and combining data are easy enough for database novices to achieve.
          








In-Memory Data Engine

Blazing speed

            When data sources are slow or just not right for the job, Tableau’s Data Engine is the answer. It’s a breakthrough in-memory analytics database designed to overcome the limitations of existing databases and data silos. Capable of being run on ordinary computers, it leverages the complete memory hierarchy from disk to L1 cache. It shifts the curve between big data and fast analysis. And it puts that power into the hands of everyone.
          























          We believe in powerfor the people
        

          Building a company that fundamentally changes how people see and understand data requires a different philosophy. So Tableau founders imbued their company with disruptive points of view.

Liberate data

            We believe data analysis should be about asking questions, not about learning software. We make inspiring, easy-to-use products that help people achieve greatness with data. So that data can reach its full potential and positively impact the world.
          

            Data yearns to be free, to tell its stories to all those who care about its revelations. Discovering and sharing those stories should be easy. But it’s not. Why? Most software intended to help people access and understand data is hard to use. For too long, data has been trapped behind scripts, wizards and code.
          

            Today, all that changes. Today, people can choose another way. Join us in the cause to liberate data for everyone.
          









Empower people

            When a company gives people self-service analysis tools, they feel different. Respected. Capable. Powerful. People start to drive their organization forward in ways that could never have been anticipated. They express their full ingenuity and creativity.
          

            Unfortunately, most business analytics products are built to centralize and control data, not democratize it. As a result, people at most companies are reliant on specialists just to answer basic questions. They stumble through Escher-like spreadsheets to work around inflexible business systems. Or they’re being stonewalled by enterprise-wide business intelligence platforms that spend more time in development than helping anyone.
          

            There's no power in that approach. The power is in giving people the ability to think, act and deliver.
          








            Tableau Desktop is an intuitive, drag-and-drop tool that lets you see every change as you make it. Watch the video.
          




Design for people

            We design our products to focus on people. People working for big and small businesses, serving in government and building not-for-profit organizations. Bloggers. Students. Anyone. Everyone.
          

            We architect our products from the ground up, to put the user first and everything else second. We are making a clean break from the past and taking a disruptive new approach to analytics. Product design is at the heart of everything we do.
          

            The result so far? People in every industry love it. Because what you see is what you understand.

        A different kind of company
      

        We can’t change the world if we have the culture of a typical corporation. So we don’t.
      


We are on a mission

        We believe helping people to see and understand data is one of the most important missions of the 21st century. We proudly wear the mantle of “data geek.”
      


We use our products

        “We Use Our Products” is a core company value. We’re not just listening to our customers’ needs. We’re living them. We’ll never stop listening to customers and we’ll never stop seeing the world from their point of view.
      


Data informs our decisions

        We put data into action. Our R&D team analyzes billions of log records from our products to improve them. Our HR team studies our hiring trends to optimize facilities for growth and employee comfort. Our support team tracks customer cases to solve emerging issues early.
      














        Sound science
      

        There’s a science to building great software. We live by it. Research and experimentation inform our product design choices.
      

        Here are a few examples of areas Tableau is making big contributions:

The cycle of visual analysis





Fusing computer graphics and databases

            Our core technology VizQL is not only a breakthrough unification of computer graphics and databases. It’s also a case study in how to leverage best practices for human comprehension. Drag-and-drop actions become database queries that automatically display as beautiful visualizations.
          

            This fundamentally new architecture does for data interactions in visual form what SQL did for data interactions in text form. VizQL statements describe an infinite class of sophisticated and useful visualizations. People have a single user interface to answer an infinite range of questions.

Principles of visual understanding

            Perceptual and cognitive factors drive our product design. We painstakingly deliberate over every aspect of visual analytics.
          

            When we considered color selection, we hired one of the world’s foremost color cognition experts to engineer Tableau’s color palettes. To encode how shapes are represented, we studied people’s comprehension of shapes when they overlap. We custom-designed our maps because the usual online maps are meant for driving directions, not for data analysis.
          

            Why all the effort? Because the right visual representation of data sparks just the right insights. A story unfolds as people navigate from one visual summary to another. Visual analytics creates the exploratory experience necessary for ordinary people to answer questions quickly.

The cycle of visual analysis

            We study how people ask a question, analyze data to get an answer, and then ask their next question. We call this the “cycle of visual analysis:” an iterative, non-linear process where people ask questions, forage for data, create pictures and discover new questions to ask.
          

            The process is rarely sequential. A specific view of data typically generates more questions. It might suggest the need for more data. An insight might suggest a new task. The act of communicating a finding may require a new visualization.
          

            We design our products to support the cycle of visual analysis. And to guide people through it. Our patented Show Me™ technology recommends the best way to visualize data. Based on heuristic models from years of proven research, Tableau defines the right kind of visualization based on the data types and the problem at hand.
          

            We know that thinking with data is hard. Our goal is to help people answer questions as fast as they can think of them.

Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]

On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange,[14] raising more than $250 million USD.[15] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[15]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[16] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[17] The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[18] In August 2016, Tableau announced the appointment of Adam Selipsky as president and CEO, effective September 16, 2016, replacing co-founder Christian Chabot as CEO.[19]
Wikileaks and policy changes[edit]

On December 2, 2010, Tableau withdrew its visualizations from the contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak by WikiLeaks, with Tableau stating that it was directly due to political pressure from US Senator Joe Lieberman.[20][21]
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[22] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[23] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[23] Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[24]
Awards[edit]
Tableau Software has won awards including "Best Overall in Data Visualization" by DM Review, "Best of 2005 for Data Analysis" by PC Magazine,[25] and "2008 Best Business Intelligence Solution (CODiE award)" by the Software & Information Industry Association.[26]

Tableau Software (/tæbˈloʊ/ tab-LOH) is a software company[2] headquartered in Seattle, Washington, United States which produces interactive data visualization products[3] focused on business intelligence.[4] It initially began in order to commercialize research which had been conducted at Stanford University's Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[5] It was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes.[6] The product queries relational databases, OLAP cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types.
Tableau has a mapping functionality,[7][8] and is able to plot latitude and longitude coordinates.[9] It has been criticized for being overly US-centric.[10] They also offer custom geocoding,[11] as well as five ways to access their products: Desktop (both professional and personal editions), Server, Online (which scales to support thousands of users), Reader, and Public, with the last two free to use.[12] Vizable, a consumer data visualization mobile app, was released in 2015.[13]
