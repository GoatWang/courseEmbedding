Introduction



The purpose of the Notice (the first two pages of this document) is to
advise you of the time, place and purposes of an Annual Meeting of the
Shareholders of Churchill Tax-Free Fund of Kentucky (the "Fund"). The purpose of
this Proxy Statement (all the rest of this document) is to give you information
on which you may base your decisions as to the choices, if any, you make in
voting.


A copy of the Fund's most recent annual report and most recent
semi-annual report will be sent to you without charge upon written request to
the Fund's Distributor, Aquila Distributors, Inc., 380 Madison Avenue, Suite
2300, New York, NY 10017 or by calling 800-872-5859 toll free or 212-697-6666.

This Notice and Proxy Statement are first being mailed on or about
March 5, 2001.


You should read the Proxy Statement prior to voting. Then, you may vote
in one of three ways:






Proxy Card



The enclosed proxy card authorizes the persons named (or their
substitutes) to vote your shares; the Fund calls these persons the "proxy
holders." As to the election of Trustees you may authorize the proxy holders to
vote your shares for the entire slate indicated below by marking the appropriate
box on the proxy card or by merely signing and returning your proxy card with no
instructions. Or, you may withhold the authority of the proxy holders to vote on
the election of Trustees by marking the appropriate box. Also, you may withhold
that authority as to any particular nominee by following the instructions on the
proxy card.


As to the other matter listed on the proxy card, you may direct the
proxy holders to vote your shares on this proposal by marking the appropriate
box "For" or "Against" or instruct them not to vote your shares on the proposal
by marking the "Abstain" box. If you return your signed proxy card and do not
mark the box on the proposal, the proxy holders will vote your shares for that
proposal.



Telephone Voting



To vote your shares by telephone, call the toll free number on
your proxy card. You will be prompted to enter the control number on your proxy
card. Follow the recorded instructions using your proxy card as a guide. If you
vote by phone, you need not return the proxy card by mail.



Internet Voting



To vote your shares by the Internet, please contact the Fund at the
address shown on your proxy card. You will be prompted to enter the control
number on your proxy card. Follow the instructions on the screen, using your
proxy card as a guide. If you vote by the Internet, you need not return the
proxy card by mail.


You may end the power of the proxy holders to vote your shares by: (i)
so notifying the Fund in writing; (ii) signing a new and different proxy card
(if the Fund receives it before the old one is used); (iii) voting your shares
at the meeting in person or by your duly appointed agent; or (iv) calling the
toll free number described above or contacting the Fund's Internet address
described above, entering your control number and revoking your previous vote.


Shares held by brokers in "street name" and not voted or marked as
abstentions will not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or voted on
any matter.


The Fund is sending you this Notice and Proxy Statement in connection
with the solicitation by its Trustees of proxies to be used at the Annual
Meeting to be held at the time and place and for the purposes indicated in the
Notice or any adjourned meeting or meetings. Whenever it is stated in this Proxy
Statement that a matter is to be acted on at the Meeting, this means the Meeting
held at the scheduled time or any adjourned meeting or meetings.


The Fund pays the costs of the solicitation. Proxies are being
solicited by the use of the mails; they may also be solicited by telephone,
facsimile and personal interviews. Brokerage firms, banks and others may be
requested to forward this Notice and Proxy Statement to beneficial owners of the
Fund's shares so that these owners may authorize the voting of their shares. The
Fund will pay these firms their out-of-pocket expenses for doing so.


On the record date, the Fund had three classes of shares outstanding.
All shareholders of the Fund are entitled to vote at the meeting. Each
shareholder on the record date is entitled to one vote for each dollar (and a
proportionate fractional vote for each fraction of a dollar) of net asset value
(determined as of the record date) represented by full and fractional shares of
any class held on the record date. On the record date, the net asset value per
share of each of the Fund's outstanding classes of shares was as follows: Class
A Shares, $10.40; Class C Shares, $10.40; and Class Y Shares, $10.41. The
meeting is expected to act only upon matters that affect the Fund as a whole:

the election of Trustees and the action on the proposal. On matters that affect
the Fund as a whole, all shareholders of the Fund, including the shareholders of
all classes of the Fund, are entitled to vote at the meeting.


On the record date, the total number of shares outstanding for each
class of shares was as follows: Class A Shares, 19,030,676; Class C Shares,
192,261; and Class Y Shares, 1,526,627.


On the  record  date,  the  following  holders  held 5% or  more  of the  Fund's
outstanding shares. On the basis of information  received from the institutional
holders the Fund's management believes that all of the shares indicated are held
by them for the benefit of clients

Class A Shares may be purchased without a sales charge by certain of
the Fund's Trustees and officers.


The Fund's Manager is Manager or Administrator to the Aquilasm Group of
Funds, which consists of tax-free municipal bond funds, money-market funds and
equity funds. As of December 31, 2000, these funds had aggregate assets of
approximately $3.1 billion, of which approximately $1.8 billion consisted of
assets of the tax-free municipal bond funds. The Manager is controlled by Mr.
Lacy B. Herrmann, through share ownership directly, through a trust and by his
wife. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 the Fund paid $859,027 in
management fees.


During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000, $298,766 was paid under
Part I of the Fund's Distribution Plan to Qualified Recipients with respect to
the Class A Shares, of which $7,055 was retained by the Distributor. With
respect to Class C shares, during the same period $13,188 was paid under Part II
of the Plan and $4,396 was paid under the Shareholder Services plan. Of these
total payments of $17,584, the Distributor received $10,129. All of such
payments were for compensation.


The Distributor currently handles the distribution of the shares of
fourteen funds (five money-market funds, seven tax-free municipal bond funds and
two equity funds), including the Fund. Under the Distribution Agreement, the
Distributor is responsible for the payment of certain printing and distribution
costs relating to prospectuses and reports as well as the costs of supplemental
sales literature, advertising and other promotional activities. The shares of
the Distributor are owned 24% by Diana P. Herrmann, 72% by Mr. Herrmann and
other members of his immediate family and the balance by a former officer of the
Distributor.






Other Information on Trustees



The Trustees have appointed a standing Audit Committee consisting of
all of the Trustees (the "Independent Trustees") who are not "interested
persons" of the Fund, as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. The Committee (i)
recommends to the Board of Trustees what firm of independent auditors will be
selected by the Board of Trustees (subject to shareholder ratification); (ii)
reviews the methods, scope and result of audits and the fees charged; and (iii)
reviews the adequacy of the Fund's internal accounting procedures and controls.
The Committee held one meeting during the Fund's last fiscal year. The Board of
Trustees does not have a nominating committee. During the Fund's last fiscal
year, the Board of Trustees held four meetings. All current Trustees were
present for at least 75% of the total number of Board meetings and Audit
Committee meetings (if such Trustee was a member of that committee).



Ratification or Rejection of Selection of Independent Auditors


(Proposal No. 2)


KPMG LLP, which is currently serving as the Fund's auditors, has been
selected by the Fund's Board of Trustees, including a majority of the
Independent Trustees, as the Fund's independent auditors for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2001. Such selection is submitted to the shareholders for
ratification or rejection.


The  firm  has no  direct  or  indirect  financial  interest  in the Fund or the
Manager. It is expected that representatives of the firm will not be present at
the  meeting  but will be  available  should any matter  arise  requiring  their
presence.






Receipt of Shareholder Proposals



Under the proxy rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
shareholder proposals meeting tests contained in those rules may, under certain
conditions, be included in the Fund's proxy statement and proxy card for a
particular annual meeting. One of these conditions relates to the timely receipt
by the Fund of any such proposal. Under these rules, proposals submitted for
inclusion in the proxy material for the Fund's next annual meeting after the
meeting to which this Proxy Statement relates must be received by the Fund not
less than 120 days before the anniversary of the date stated in this Proxy
Statement for the first mailing of this Proxy Statement. The date for such
submission could change, depending on the scheduled date for the next annual
meeting; if so, the Fund will so advise you.


The fact that the Fund receives a shareholder proposal in a timely
manner does not insure its inclusion in the Fund's proxy material, since there
are other requirements in the proxy rules relating to such inclusion.



Other Business



The Fund does not know of any other matter which will come up for
action at the Meeting. If any other matter or matters properly come up for
action at the Meeting, including any adjournment of the Meeting, the proxy
holders will vote the shares which your proxy card, telephone or internet vote
entitles them to vote, in accordance with their judgment on such matter or
matters, except as noted. That is, by signing and returning your proxy card or
by voting by telephone or the Internet, you give the proxy holders discretionary
authority as to any such matter or matters.

the investment companies (which include all series thereof) listed              
on Schedule A (the "Funds") and the corporations (the "Service
Providers") listed on Schedule A, being providers of services to the            
Funds, on the date hereof consisting of Aquila Investment Management            
LLC ("Aquila"), Aquila Distributors, Inc. and STCM Management Company,          
Inc. (the Funds and Service Providers being referred to collectively            
as the "Parties" and separately as a "Party").                                  

WHEREAS, the Parties are parties to an Agreement among Insureds 
dated as of May 9, 2001, as from time to time amended, and wish to              
enter into this Agreement to amend their prior agreement to provide             
for the changes that have occurred as to the insurance involved;                

WHEREAS the Funds, their Trustees (the "Trustees") and officers 
and the Service Providers and their directors and officers were jointly         
insured under a Directors and Officers/Errors and Omissions Liability           
Insurance Policy (the "Original Policy") issued by ICI Mutual Insurance         
Company (the "Insurer"), providing a $10 million ($10,000,000) limit of         
liability in the aggregate (subject to exclusions and deductibles)              
during the period May 9, 2001 to May 9, 2002, renewed for successive            
periods thereafter;                                                             

WHEREAS, the Original Policy has been amended, including an     
amendment effective September 7, 2004 to provide four levels of insurance       
(each, a "Level") as set forth on Schedule B to this Agreement, with            
varying amounts of coverage and differing insureds, the first Level             
applying to all Parties, the second and third Levels applying to two            
separate groups of named Funds and the fourth level applying to all Funds,      
each Level providing coverage only when coverage at prior Levels has been       
exhausted;                                                                      

WHEREAS, the Original Policy as so revised is referred to herein
as the "Policy";                                                                

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set    
forth below, the Parties agree as follows:                                      

The premiums for each level of the Policy, including tax,                       
shall be allocated among the Parties as shown on Schedule B                     
hereto.  As the Policy is for a one-year term and is renewed                    
annually, Schedule B and premium allocations shall be revised                   
upon each renewal of the Policy for each additional term.                       
All additional costs of each Level of the Policy shall be                       
allocated among the Parties in the same ratio as the allocation                 
of the Policy premiums for that Level.  Notwithstanding anything                
herein to the contrary, the premium allocation to each Fund                     
shall be determined, and revised as appropriate, in compliance                  
with part (d)(7)(ii) of Rule 17d-1 under the Investment Company                 
Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").                                       

In the event that losses covered by a Level of the Policy                       
("Covered Losses") are suffered by one or more Parties that exceed              
in the aggregate the limit of liability of the Policy, the limit on           
the amount retained by each Party from its recovery from that Level             
shall be determined as follows:                                                 

a)      Base Coverage                           

There shall be computed a benefit allocation for each Party                     
(its "Base Coverage") determined by applying to the Policy's                    
limit of liability for that Level the allocation percentage                     
for that Level shown for that Party in Schedule B;                              

Each Party suffering a Covered Loss shall be entitled to a                      
benefit of up to the amount of its Base Coverage.                             

Proportional Allocation to Remaining Losses                                     

The amount of any benefit ("Remaining Coverage") remaining                      
after application of Base Coverages to Covered Losses shall                     
be allocated to those Covered Losses (the "Remaining Losses")                   
remaining after application of Base Coverages.                                

The Remaining Coverage retained by each Party shall be                          
limited to the proportion of all Remaining Coverage which                       
the amount of that party's Remaining Losses bears to the                        
Remaining Losses of all Parties.                                                

The amount that a Party may recover shall be adjusted if                        
necessary to reflect the fact that there is no priority in                      
time of any claim or recovery.                                                  

A newly created investment company (a "New Fund") having                        
an administrator, investment adviser or sub-adviser that is,                    
or is an "affiliated person" (as defined in the 1940 Act) of, a                 
Service Provider may become a named Insured under and as defined                
in the Policy, and the Trustees and officers of the New Fund may                
become insureds, provided that the New Fund causes this Agreement               
to be signed on its behalf as of the date that it agrees to the                 
terms and conditions of this Agreement; such New Fund shall be                  
deemed to be added to Schedule A.  A Fund may become an insured                 
under a Level of the Policy as to which it was not previously                   
insured, and the Trustees and officers of that Fund may become                  
insureds under that Level.  A party that is an affiliated person                
of, or an affiliated person of an affiliated person of, a Service               
Provider (a "New Service Provider") may become a named insured                  
under the Policy, and its directors and officers may become Insureds,           
provided that the New Service Provider causes this Agreement to be              
signed on its behalf as of the date that it agrees to the terms and             
conditions of this Agreement; such New Service Provider shall                 
thereupon be deemed to be added to Schedule A.  In any such event,              
a new Schedule B hereto, revised by Aquila to reflect changed                   
allocations, shall be substituted for the then-current Schedule B.              

Aquila shall take all steps necessary or appropriate to maintain                
coverage under the Policy, including, without limitation, providing             
the Insurer with all notices necessary or appropriate under the Policy          
and maintaining or overseeing payment of premiums so that the Policy            
remains continuously in effect.                                                 

Aquila shall provide the Trustees with copies of all notices                    
under the Policy appropriate for informing the Trustees of                      
coverage thereunder, including, without limitation:                             

All notices to the Insurer concerning potential liability under the Policy;     

All notices to the Insurer concerning acquisitions, mergers and 
material changes; and                                                           

All notices of the Insurer concerning cancellation or limitation
of coverage under the Policy.                                                   

Aquila shall, to the extent practicable, assure that all current                
or former Trustees or officers covered under the Policy shall have at           
least three months' notice of any policy amendment or replacement policy        
which reduces or restricts coverage of such persons under the Policy.  No       
notice need be given to former Trustees or officers who have not been           
Trustees or officers for at least six years.                                    

  8. Each of the Parties understands and agrees that the obligations
of the Funds under this Agreement are not binding upon any shareholder          
or Trustee of any Fund, but bind only the Funds and their property.             
Each of the Parties represents that it has notice of the provisions of          
the Declarations of Trust of the Funds that disclaim shareholder and            
Trustee liability for acts and obligations of the Funds.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties have executed this Agreement    
as of the date above written.

Zargon Energy Trust to Acquire Churchill Energy Inc.



CALGARY, ALBERTA--(Marketwire - July 28, 2009) - Zargon Energy Trust ("Zargon") (TSX:ZAR.UN)(TSX:ZOG.B) and Churchill Energy Inc. ("Churchill") (TSX VENTURE:CEI) are pleased to announce that they have entered into an Arrangement Agreement pursuant to which Zargon will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Churchill. Pursuant to the agreement, Churchill shareholders will receive, for each common share held, at the election of each holder, either (i) 0.01363 trust units of Zargon for a deemed value of $0.22; (ii) $0.22 in cash; or (iii) a combination thereof, subject to proration such that a maximum of $4.6 million will be paid in cash. The consideration to be received by the Churchill shareholders represents a premium of approximately 90%, based on the five day weighted average trading price of the Churchill common shares ending on July 27, 2009 and a 100% premium based on the closing price of the Churchill common shares on July 27, 2009. The proposed transaction is valued at approximately $15.0 million, including the assumption of approximately $5.8 million of net debt (inclusive of adjustments and transaction costs and based on a 5 day volume weighted average trading price to July 22, 2009 of Zargon units of $16.14 per unit).

Churchill is currently producing approximately 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day of which approximately 61 percent is from the operated Grand Forks, Brazeau and Jarrow/Killam properties in Alberta.

PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT

Churchill shareholders may elect to receive either 0.01363 Zargon trust units or $0.22 cash for each Churchill common share, subject to a maximum of $4.6 million of cash. The transaction will be completed pursuant to a Plan of Arrangement (the "Arrangement") which requires the approval of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Churchill shareholders at a special meeting of Churchill to be called to consider the Arrangement (the "Meeting") along with customary regulatory, court and other approvals. An Information Circular outlining the Arrangement is expected to be mailed to Churchill shareholders in mid to late August, 2009 in respect of the Meeting, which is anticipated to take place in late September, 2009. If the Arrangement is completed prior to September 29, 2009, as currently anticipated, the first post-Arrangement distribution by Zargon will be paid on October 15, 2009 to Zargon unitholders (including former Churchill shareholders who have elected to receive and continue to hold Zargon trust units) of record on September 30, 2009.

The Boards of Directors of both Zargon and Churchill have unanimously approved the Arrangement. The Board of Directors of Churchill has concluded that the Arrangement is in the best interests of its shareholders and has resolved to recommend that Churchill shareholders vote their Churchill shares in favour of the Arrangement, given that the Arrangement is expected to provide Churchill shareholders with consideration equal to a premium of approximately 90% over the five day weighted average trading price of the Churchill common shares, and, to the extent shareholders receive Zargon trust units, with monthly cash distributions, access to improved liquidity, continued participation in Churchill's oil and gas prospects, and participation in a significantly larger oil and gas company with a lower costs of capital and improved access to capital.

Certain of the directors and officers of Churchill, beneficially owning approximately 19 percent of the shares of Churchill, have agreed to vote their shares in favour of the Arrangement. The Arrangement prohibits Churchill from soliciting or initiating discussion regarding any other business combination or sale of material assets, contains provisions for Zargon to match competing, unsolicited proposals and, subject to certain conditions, provides for a $0.52 million termination fee.

Peters & Co. Limited acted as exclusive financial advisor to Churchill with respect to the transaction and has provided the Churchill Board of Directors with a verbal opinion that, subject to reviewing final documentation, the consideration to be received by the Churchill shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement is fair, from a financial point of view, to the Churchill shareholders.

STRATEGIC RATIONALE

Over its history, Zargon has followed a value-seeking business strategy with the specific objectives of providing long-term, per unit production and reserve growth in a partial cash flow distribution business model. The acquisition of Churchill supports these objectives by providing oil exploitation opportunities and high quality tax pools in addition to natural gas production and undeveloped lands. Specifically, Churchill brings the following assets and opportunities to Zargon:

- Current production of approximately 400 barrels of oil equivalent per day, consisting of 195 barrels of oil per day and 1.23 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.

- Estimated proved and probable reserves of 0.85 million of barrels of oil equivalent which are comprised of 0.57 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 1.71 billion cubic feet of natural gas (based on a Zargon's internal reserve estimate as of July 22, 2009).

- Working interests varying from 56 to 100 percent in three medium and heavy oil Mannville and Sawtooth pools in the Grand Forks area of Southern Alberta where significant incremental waterflood and tertiary recovery potential has been identified.

- A 95 percent working interest in the light oil Brazeau River Nisku I pool of West Central Alberta where significant incremental waterflood recovery potential has been identified.

- Estimated tax pools of approximately $54 million at June 30, 2009.

- A significant undeveloped land position of approximately 61,000 net acres.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

Forward-Looking Statements - This document offers our assessment of Zargon's future plans and operations as at July 28, 2009, and contains forward-looking statements including:

- The timing of the mailing of the information circular, the holding of the shareholders meeting, the consideration to paid to shareholders and the effective date of the Arrangement referred to under the heading "PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT";

- The payment and timing of payments of distributions referred to under the heading "PLAN OF ARRANGEMENT";

- Our future plans, costs and additional recovery of reserves at the Grand Forks and Brazeau properties referred to under the heading "STRATEGIC RATIONALE"; and

- the availability of tax pools for utilization by Zargon referred to under the heading "STRATEGIC RATIONALE".

In addition, information and statements relating to "reserves" are deemed to be forward-looking information and statements, as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated, and that the reserves can be profitably produced in the future. Such statements are generally identified by the use of words such as "anticipate", "continue", "estimate", "expect", "forecast", "may", "will", "project", "should", "plan", "intend", "believe" and similar expressions (including the negatives thereof). By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control, such as those relating to results of operations and financial condition, general economic conditions, industry conditions, changes in regulatory and taxation regimes, volatility of commodity prices, escalation of operating and capital costs, currency fluctuations, the availability of services, imprecision of reserve estimates, geological, technical, drilling and processing problems, environmental risks, weather, the lack of availability of qualified personnel or management, stock market volatility, the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources and competition from other industry participants for, among other things, capital, services, acquisitions of reserves, undeveloped lands and skilled personnel; the inability to obtain the required consents, permits or approvals (including court, lender and shareholder) to the Arrangement; and the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of the Arrangement. Risks are described in more detail in Zargon's Annual Information Form for the year ended December 31, 2008 and Churchill's MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2008 and for the first quarter of 2008, all of which are available on SEDAR at www.sedar.ca and available on Zargon's and Churchill's respective websites. Forward-looking statements are provided to allow investors to have a greater understanding of our business.

You are cautioned that the assumptions, including among other things, future oil and natural gas prices; future capital expenditure levels; future production levels; future exchange rates; the cost of developing and expanding our assets; our ability to obtain equipment in a timely manner to carry out development activities; our ability to market our oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; the impact of increasing competition; our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms; and our ability to add production and reserves through our development and acquisition activities used in the preparation of such information, although considered reasonable at the time of preparation, may prove to be imprecise and, as such, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements. Our actual results, performance, or achievement could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. We can give no assurance that any of the events anticipated will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what benefits we will derive from them. The forward-looking information contained in this document is expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Our policy for updating forward-looking statements is that Zargon disclaims, except as required by law, any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

BARRELS OF OIL EQUIVALENT

Barrels of oil equivalent ("boe") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead.

CHURCHILL TAX FREE TRUST - DEF 14A - 20010308 - PROXY_CARD





Proxy Card



The enclosed proxy card authorizes the persons named (or their
substitutes) to vote your shares; the Fund calls these persons the "proxy
holders." As to the election of Trustees you may authorize the proxy holders to
vote your shares for the entire slate indicated below by marking the appropriate
box on the proxy card or by merely signing and returning your proxy card with no
instructions. Or, you may withhold the authority of the proxy holders to vote on
the election of Trustees by marking the appropriate box. Also, you may withhold
that authority as to any particular nominee by following the instructions on the
proxy card.


As to the other matter listed on the proxy card, you may direct the
proxy holders to vote your shares on this proposal by marking the appropriate
box "For" or "Against" or instruct them not to vote your shares on the proposal
by marking the "Abstain" box. If you return your signed proxy card and do not
mark the box on the proposal, the proxy holders will vote your shares for that
proposal.



Telephone Voting



To vote your shares by telephone, call the toll free number on
your proxy card. You will be prompted to enter the control number on your proxy
card. Follow the recorded instructions using your proxy card as a guide. If you
vote by phone, you need not return the proxy card by mail.



Internet Voting



To vote your shares by the Internet, please contact the Fund at the
address shown on your proxy card. You will be prompted to enter the control
number on your proxy card. Follow the instructions on the screen, using your
proxy card as a guide. If you vote by the Internet, you need not return the
proxy card by mail.


You may end the power of the proxy holders to vote your shares by: (i)
so notifying the Fund in writing; (ii) signing a new and different proxy card
(if the Fund receives it before the old one is used); (iii) voting your shares
at the meeting in person or by your duly appointed agent; or (iv) calling the
toll free number described above or contacting the Fund's Internet address
described above, entering your control number and revoking your previous vote.


Shares held by brokers in "street name" and not voted or marked as
abstentions will not be counted for purposes of determining a quorum or voted on
any matter.


The Fund is sending you this Notice and Proxy Statement in connection
with the solicitation by its Trustees of proxies to be used at the Annual
Meeting to be held at the time and place and for the purposes indicated in the
Notice or any adjourned meeting or meetings. Whenever it is stated in this Proxy
Statement that a matter is to be acted on at the Meeting, this means the Meeting
held at the scheduled time or any adjourned meeting or meetings.


The Fund pays the costs of the solicitation. Proxies are being
solicited by the use of the mails; they may also be solicited by telephone,
facsimile and personal interviews. Brokerage firms, banks and others may be
requested to forward this Notice and Proxy Statement to beneficial owners of the
Fund's shares so that these owners may authorize the voting of their shares. The
Fund will pay these firms their out-of-pocket expenses for doing so.


On the record date, the Fund had three classes of shares outstanding.
All shareholders of the Fund are entitled to vote at the meeting. Each
shareholder on the record date is entitled to one vote for each dollar (and a
proportionate fractional vote for each fraction of a dollar) of net asset value
(determined as of the record date) represented by full and fractional shares of
any class held on the record date. On the record date, the net asset value per
share of each of the Fund's outstanding classes of shares was as follows: Class
A Shares, $10.40; Class C Shares, $10.40; and Class Y Shares, $10.41. The
meeting is expected to act only upon matters that affect the Fund as a whole:

the election of Trustees and the action on the proposal. On matters that affect
the Fund as a whole, all shareholders of the Fund, including the shareholders of
all classes of the Fund, are entitled to vote at the meeting.

LEGAL TERMS



BENEFICIARYA person or organization legally entitled to receive benefits through a legal device, such as a will, trust or life insurance policy.

COUNTERCLAIMA defendant's court papers that seek to reverse the thrust of the lawsuit by claiming that it was the plaintiff -- not the defendant -- who committed legal wron... (more...)A defendant's court papers that seek to reverse the thrust of the lawsuit by claiming that it was the plaintiff -- not the defendant -- who committed legal wrongs, and that as a result it is the defendant who is entitled to money damages or other relief. Usually filed as part of the defendant's answer -- which also denies plaintiff's claims -- a counterclaim is commonly but not always based on the same events that form the basis of the plaintiff's complaint. For example, a defendant in an auto accident lawsuit might file a counterclaim alleging that it was really the plaintiff who caused the accident. In some states, the counterclaim has been replaced by a similar legal pleading called a cross-complaint. In other states and in federal court, where counterclaims are still used, a defendant must file any counterclaim that stems from the same events covered by the plaintiff's complaint or forever lose the right to do so. In still other states where counterclaims are used, they are not mandatory, meaning a defendant is free to raise a claim that it was really the plaintiff who was at fault either in a counterclaim or later as part of a separate lawsuit.

REAL ESTATE AGENTA foot soldier of the real estate business who shows houses and does most of the other nitty-gritty tasks associated with selling real estate. An agent must hav... (more...)A foot soldier of the real estate business who shows houses and does most of the other nitty-gritty tasks associated with selling real estate. An agent must have a state license and be supervised by a real estate broker. Most agents are completely dependent upon commissions from sellers for their income, so it pays to find out which side the agent represents (buyer, seller or both) before you place too much trust in the agent's opinion.

GENERATION-SKIPPING TRUSTA trust designed to save on estate tax. The trust principal is preserved for the trust maker's grandchildren, with his or her children receiving only income fro... (more...)A trust designed to save on estate tax. The trust principal is preserved for the trust maker's grandchildren, with his or her children receiving only income from the trust. Because the children (the middle generation) never legally own the property, it isn't subject to estate tax at their death. See generation-skipping transfer tax.

LETTERS TESTAMENTARYThe document given to an executor by the probate court, authorizing the executor to settle the estate according to either a will or the state's intestate succes... (more...)The document given to an executor by the probate court, authorizing the executor to settle the estate according to either a will or the state's intestate succession laws.

PROPERTY CONTROL TRUSTAny trust that imposes limits or controls over the rights of trust beneficiaries. These trusts include (1) special needs trusts designed to assist people who ha... (more...)Any trust that imposes limits or controls over the rights of trust beneficiaries. These trusts include (1) special needs trusts designed to assist people who have special physical, emotional or other requirements, (2) spendthrift trusts designed to prevent a beneficiary from wasting the trust principal; and (3) sprinkling trusts that allow the trustee to decide how to distribute trust income or principal among the beneficiaries.

PROVING A WILLConvincing a probate court that a document is truly the deceased person's will. Usually this is a simple formality that the executor or administrator easily sat... (more...)Convincing a probate court that a document is truly the deceased person's will. Usually this is a simple formality that the executor or administrator easily satisfies by showing that the will was signed and dated by the deceased person in front of two or more witnesses. When the will is holographic -- that is, completely handwritten by the deceased and not witnessed, it is still valid in many states if the executor can produce relatives and friends to testify that the handwriting is that of the deceased.

HEIR AT LAWA person entitled to inherit property under intestate succession laws.

DISCHARGE (OF PROBATE ADMINISTRATOR)A court order releasing the administrator or executor from any further duties connected with the probate of an estate. This typically occurs when the duties hav... (more...)A court order releasing the administrator or executor from any further duties connected with the probate of an estate. This typically occurs when the duties have been completed but may happen sooner if the executor or administrator wishes to withdraw or is dismissed.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. The current yield reflects the current earnings of the fund, while the total return refers to a specific past holding period. The 7-Day Yield is the average income return over the previous seven days, assuming the rate stays the same for one year and that dividends are reinvested. It is the Fund's total income net of expenses, divided by the total number of outstanding shares and includes any applicable waiver or reimbursement.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
