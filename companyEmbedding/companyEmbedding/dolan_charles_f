Early life[edit]
Dolan was born in Cleveland. The son of an inventor, he served in the U.S. Air Force and studied at John Carroll University before dropping out and entering the telecommunications field.
Career[edit]
His earliest professional endeavors focused on the packaging, marketing and distribution of sports and industrial films. Working together with his wife in their Cleveland home, Dolan edited and produced short film reels of sports events for syndication to television stations. Selling the business, Dolan joined the acquiring firm and moved east to New York.
In the early 1960s, Dolan established Teleguide Inc., which provided information services via cable to New York City hotels. That same decade, he founded Sterling Manhattan Cable, the first urban cable television company in the nation. In its early years, Sterling forged first-of-its-kind agreements to bring New York professional sports teams, cultural programming and movies into the homes of New York City cable viewers.
In the early 1970s, Dolan founded Home Box Office, the first premium programming service in the cable television industry, which he sold to Time Life. Later he organized Cablevision Systems Corporation on Long Island and has spearheaded many of the company's advancements. Most recently, he was the vision behind VOOM, Cablevision's effort to expand content delivery and meet the demands of the exploding HDTV market, which was expected to include 6 million households by the end of 2003—and 12 million by year-end 2005.
From 2001 through early 2002, Dolan was a major bidder in the sale of the Boston Red Sox. Dolan submitted a maximum bid of $750 million,[4] but ultimately lost out to a group headed by John Henry, Tom Werner, and Larry Lucchino.
Dolan is a trustee of Fairfield University and a member of the board of governors of St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, New York.
In November 2016, Dolan received an honorary doctorate from Fairfield University, "in recognition of his remarkable contribution to our culture industry, for his exemplary vision and tenacity as a media pioneer, and for his important contribution to Fairfield University as a trustee and donor who has supported scholarship funds and the Charles F. Dolan School of Business."[5]
Personal life[edit]
Dolan and his wife, Helen Ann, reside in Oyster Bay, Long Island. They have six children,[1] among them James L. Dolan, a stakeholder in Charles's media properties, and Patrick Dolan, president of Newsday subsidiary News 12 Networks. Charles's younger brother Larry Dolan and nephew Paul Dolan own the Cleveland Indians.
Legacy[edit]
The Fairfield University Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University is named in recognition of his $25 million donation in 2000 and his service to the university as a member of the board of trustees.[6]
The Dolan Center for Science and Technology is John Carroll University's showcase building. Completed in 2003 at a cost of over $66 million, it houses JCU's science departments, including Mathematics and Computer Science.[7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
The Dolan School of Business finds its roots in the Department of Business established in 1947 within the College of Arts and Sciences at Fairfield University. The undergraduate programs received accreditation from the AACSB in 1977. In 1978, the stand-alone Dolan School of Business was founded after the undergraduate programs of the Department of Business were separated from the College of Arts and Sciences and the school began offering a graduate degree program, a Master of Science in Financial Management. The degree was later renamed the Master of Science in Finance (MSF). In 1984, the school introduced its second graduate degree program, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, Information Systems and Operations Management, International Business, Marketing, and Taxation.
In 1990, Kevin Conlisk '66 established the Father John Conlisk Irish Scholarship which awards a full-ride every year to an MBA or MSF candidate from the Republic of Ireland to foster cultural exchange and international relations. In 1997, the school received full accreditation for its graduate and undergraduate programs from AACSB International.




Approach to Dolan School of Business


In 2000, the school was renamed the Charles F. Dolan School of Business in recognition of a $25 million gift from Charles F. Dolan, founder of Cablevision Systems Corporation and HBO, and former trustee of the university. The same year, the school moved to a separate on-campus facility containing about 70,000 square feet, including an amphitheater that seats 150, 64 offices, 11 classrooms, and workrooms for student projects. The building had been constructed in 1979 as the Center for Financial Studies in a partnership between Fairfield University and the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. In 2005, the school formed the Dolan Advisory Council led by John O'Neill '71 (former Senior Partner at Ernst & Young) and consisting of 17 business executives charged with advising and assisting the Dean in the advancement of the Dolan School of Business. In 2006, the school introduced a Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for a career in accounting and to fulfill the 150-credit hour requirement in most states to take the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination.
In 2012, the school established its Entrepreneur In Residence Program designed to bring entrepreneurs to the school for a one-year term to share their experiences starting a business. In 2013, the school, in partnership with the Economic Development Department of the Town of Fairfield and Kleban Properties, established the Fairfield Accelerator and Mentor Enterprise (FAME), a business incubator for local entrepreneurs located in downtown Fairfield.[1] Initial FAME entrepreneurs include SoccerGrlProbs, LLC, a company started by three Fairfield University alumnae which took first place in the for-profit track of the 2014 Next Play Venture Pitch Tournament, a national competition for student-led business plans that aim to make the sports industry more sustainable.
In 2015, the school introduced a Master of Business Analytics (MSBA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for careers in business intelligence and quantitative analytics.

Experiential Learning[edit]




Rear of Dolan School of Business


BEST classroom[edit]
The Business Education Simulation & Trading (BEST) classroom provides Dolan School of Business undergraduate and graduate business students the opportunity of working on a financial markets trading floor. The 2,300-square-foot (210 m2) BEST classroom provides students with the experience of dealing with real-world financial market trading situations ranging from case studies and contact with other companies to discussion of economic and business events.
The BEST classroom is equipped with a stock ticker and a data wall displaying real time quotes and 34 workstations loaded with financial software including: RITC (Rotman Interactive Trader) for market trading simulations; Bloomberg Professional with business and economic news and data; Research Insight including Compustat and Global Vantage containing financial information on every publicly trading company in the world; and Center for Research in Security Prices with stock returns for all U.S. companies.
Fairfield Investment Group[edit]
The Fairfield Investment Group received an investment of $100,000 from an anonymous private investor in 2010. With about 20 students researching stocks and making investment decision, the group is an opportunity for them to strengthen trading and analysis skills, prepare for future jobs, and connect with students and alumni.
The club is run by students — most from the Dolan School of Business — and has a management team that includes a chief executive officer, a position held by a senior finance major. The student club assigns members to research companies using Bloomberg terminals, which provide business and economic news and data. Students then work in teams deciding which stocks to invest in or divest from. They submit reports and recommendations to fellow student members serving as portfolio managers and executive leaders, who vote on whether they should buy, sell, or hold.
Fairfield StartUp[edit]
Fairfield StartUp is a yearly program of events designed to assist young entrepreneurs in the creation of their own businesses. The program connects these students with mentors and Fairfield alumni who are already established in the worlds of business, finance and engineering to guide them through the ups and downs of creating a business and pitching it to potential investors. The program culminates each year at the StartUp Showcase, where students negotiate live with investors for seed money to start their businesses.[5]
Community engagement[edit]
Center for Microfinance[edit]
The Center for Microfinance works to help develop self-sustaining business operations in developing countries. In keeping with the Jesuit mission of Fairfield University, Dr. Winston Tellis and Dr. Michael Tucker co-founded the Center in 2001 where they have helped develop self-sustaining businesses in poor rural areas of Haiti and Nicaragua. The center was honored for its work for Haiti's poor by FONKOZE USA (F/USA) which supports Fonkoze (Fondasyon Kole Zepol), Haiti's only alternative bank for the poor. F/USA is one of five non-profit organizations approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to solicit U.S. investments for foreign organizations.
Universidad Centroamericana Partnership[edit]
CMAC is participating in a signed partnership between Fairfield University and the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), in Managua, Nicaragua. UCA sponsors the largest microfinance institution in Nicaragua, Fondo de Desarrollo Local (FDL). Through that organization Dolan School of Business students spent part of the 2005 winter break working at the FDL's León branch office.

Experiential Learning[edit]




Rear of Dolan School of Business


BEST classroom[edit]
The Business Education Simulation & Trading (BEST) classroom provides Dolan School of Business undergraduate and graduate business students the opportunity of working on a financial markets trading floor. The 2,300-square-foot (210 m2) BEST classroom provides students with the experience of dealing with real-world financial market trading situations ranging from case studies and contact with other companies to discussion of economic and business events.
The BEST classroom is equipped with a stock ticker and a data wall displaying real time quotes and 34 workstations loaded with financial software including: RITC (Rotman Interactive Trader) for market trading simulations; Bloomberg Professional with business and economic news and data; Research Insight including Compustat and Global Vantage containing financial information on every publicly trading company in the world; and Center for Research in Security Prices with stock returns for all U.S. companies.
Fairfield Investment Group[edit]
The Fairfield Investment Group received an investment of $100,000 from an anonymous private investor in 2010. With about 20 students researching stocks and making investment decision, the group is an opportunity for them to strengthen trading and analysis skills, prepare for future jobs, and connect with students and alumni.
The club is run by students — most from the Dolan School of Business — and has a management team that includes a chief executive officer, a position held by a senior finance major. The student club assigns members to research companies using Bloomberg terminals, which provide business and economic news and data. Students then work in teams deciding which stocks to invest in or divest from. They submit reports and recommendations to fellow student members serving as portfolio managers and executive leaders, who vote on whether they should buy, sell, or hold.
Fairfield StartUp[edit]
Fairfield StartUp is a yearly program of events designed to assist young entrepreneurs in the creation of their own businesses. The program connects these students with mentors and Fairfield alumni who are already established in the worlds of business, finance and engineering to guide them through the ups and downs of creating a business and pitching it to potential investors. The program culminates each year at the StartUp Showcase, where students negotiate live with investors for seed money to start their businesses.[5]
Community engagement[edit]

In keeping with the Jesuit mission of Fairfield University, Dr. Winston Tellis and Dr. Michael Tucker co-founded the Center in 2001 where they have helped develop self-sustaining businesses in poor rural areas of Haiti and Nicaragua. The center was honored for its work for Haiti's poor by FONKOZE USA (F/USA) which supports Fonkoze (Fondasyon Kole Zepol), Haiti's only alternative bank for the poor. F/USA is one of five non-profit organizations approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to solicit U.S. investments for foreign organizations.
Universidad Centroamericana Partnership[edit]
CMAC is participating in a signed partnership between Fairfield University and the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), in Managua, Nicaragua.

History[edit]
The Dolan School of Business finds its roots in the Department of Business established in 1947 within the College of Arts and Sciences at Fairfield University. The undergraduate programs received accreditation from the AACSB in 1977. In 1978, the stand-alone Dolan School of Business was founded after the undergraduate programs of the Department of Business were separated from the College of Arts and Sciences and the school began offering a graduate degree program, a Master of Science in Financial Management. The degree was later renamed the Master of Science in Finance (MSF). In 1984, the school introduced its second graduate degree program, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, Information Systems and Operations Management, International Business, Marketing, and Taxation.
In 1990, Kevin Conlisk '66 established the Father John Conlisk Irish Scholarship which awards a full-ride every year to an MBA or MSF candidate from the Republic of Ireland to foster cultural exchange and international relations. In 1997, the school received full accreditation for its graduate and undergraduate programs from AACSB International.




Approach to Dolan School of Business


In 2000, the school was renamed the Charles F. Dolan School of Business in recognition of a $25 million gift from Charles F. Dolan, founder of Cablevision Systems Corporation and HBO, and former trustee of the university. The same year, the school moved to a separate on-campus facility containing about 70,000 square feet, including an amphitheater that seats 150, 64 offices, 11 classrooms, and workrooms for student projects. The building had been constructed in 1979 as the Center for Financial Studies in a partnership between Fairfield University and the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. In 2005, the school formed the Dolan Advisory Council led by John O'Neill '71 (former Senior Partner at Ernst & Young) and consisting of 17 business executives charged with advising and assisting the Dean in the advancement of the Dolan School of Business. In 2006, the school introduced a Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for a career in accounting and to fulfill the 150-credit hour requirement in most states to take the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination.
In 2012, the school established its Entrepreneur In Residence Program designed to bring entrepreneurs to the school for a one-year term to share their experiences starting a business. In 2013, the school, in partnership with the Economic Development Department of the Town of Fairfield and Kleban Properties, established the Fairfield Accelerator and Mentor Enterprise (FAME), a business incubator for local entrepreneurs located in downtown Fairfield.[1] Initial FAME entrepreneurs include SoccerGrlProbs, LLC, a company started by three Fairfield University alumnae which took first place in the for-profit track of the 2014 Next Play Venture Pitch Tournament, a national competition for student-led business plans that aim to make the sports industry more sustainable.
In 2015, the school introduced a Master of Business Analytics (MSBA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for careers in business intelligence and quantitative analytics.

Cablevision Founder to Be Honored at NY Dinner 
Cablevision Founder to Be Honored at NY Dinner 
By Sean Smith                    Chronicle Editor

Cablevision Systems Corp. Chairman and founder Charles Dolan, a major player in the recent sale of the Boston Red Sox, will be the featured speaker at the annual Boston College Wall Street Council Tribute Dinner in New York City on April 18.



Charles Dolan, chairman and founder of Cablevision Systems Corp.

At the event, which is held in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, University President William P. Leahy, SJ, will present Dolan with the President's Medal for Excellence, which honors individuals whose personal and professional achievements exemplify the ideal proclaimed in the Boston College motto, "Ever to Excel."
More than 1,000 alumni, parents and friends of Boston College are expected to attend the dinner tribute, which benefits the University's Presidential Scholars Program.
The dinner is co-chaired by Mario J. Gabelli, chairman of Gabelli Funds Inc.; University trustee Peter S. Lynch '65, vice chairman of Fidelity Management and Research; and Robert M. Devlin, chairman of Curragh Capital Partners. All three are parents of current or former Boston College students.
Dolan, a native of Cleveland and the son of an inventor, served in the US Air Force and studied at John Carroll University before blazing a trail in telecommunications. His earliest professional endeavors focused on the packaging, marketing and distribution of sports and industrial films.  Working together with his wife in their Cleveland home, Dolan edited and produced short film reels of sports events for syndication to television stations.  
Moving to New York City in the early 1960s, Dolan established Teleguide Inc., which provided information services via cable to New York City hotels. That same decade, he founded Sterling Manhattan Cable, the first urban cable television company in the nation. Sterling forged first-of-its-kind agreements to bring New York professional sports teams, cultural programming and movies into the homes of New York City cable viewers.  
Dolan's next groundbreaking achievement came in the early 1970s, when he founded Home Box Office Inc., the first premium programming service in the cable television industry.  He organized Cablevision Systems Corp. on Long Island after the sale of Home Box Office to Time Life Inc.
Cablevision now serves 3 million cable television households in the New York metropolitan area.  Its New York tri-state customer base is the largest cable cluster in the nation. Last fall, the company launched its most significant technological advance to date, Interactive Optimum, which offers customers a comprehensive set of services including video-on-demand, digital programming, interactive television, a "click-to-view" programming guide and e-mail service through the television.
Dolan is a managing director of the Metropolitan Opera in New York, a trustee of Fairfield University and a member of the board of governors of St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, NY.

History[edit]
The Dolan School of Business finds its roots in the Department of Business established in 1947 within the College of Arts and Sciences at Fairfield University. The undergraduate programs received accreditation from the AACSB in 1977. In 1978, the stand-alone Dolan School of Business was founded after the undergraduate programs of the Department of Business were separated from the College of Arts and Sciences and the school began offering a graduate degree program, a Master of Science in Financial Management. The degree was later renamed the Master of Science in Finance (MSF). In 1984, the school introduced its second graduate degree program, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, Information Systems and Operations Management, International Business, Marketing, and Taxation.
In 1990, Kevin Conlisk '66 established the Father John Conlisk Irish Scholarship which awards a full-ride every year to an MBA or MSF candidate from the Republic of Ireland to foster cultural exchange and international relations. In 1997, the school received full accreditation for its graduate and undergraduate programs from AACSB International.




Approach to Dolan School of Business


In 2000, the school was renamed the Charles F. Dolan School of Business in recognition of a $25 million gift from Charles F. Dolan, founder of Cablevision Systems Corporation and HBO, and former trustee of the university. The same year, the school moved to a separate on-campus facility containing about 70,000 square feet, including an amphitheater that seats 150, 64 offices, 11 classrooms, and workrooms for student projects. The building had been constructed in 1979 as the Center for Financial Studies in a partnership between Fairfield University and the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. In 2005, the school formed the Dolan Advisory Council led by John O'Neill '71 (former Senior Partner at Ernst & Young) and consisting of 17 business executives charged with advising and assisting the Dean in the advancement of the Dolan School of Business. In 2006, the school introduced a Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for a career in accounting and to fulfill the 150-credit hour requirement in most states to take the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination.
In 2012, the school established its Entrepreneur In Residence Program designed to bring entrepreneurs to the school for a one-year term to share their experiences starting a business. In 2013, the school, in partnership with the Economic Development Department of the Town of Fairfield and Kleban Properties, established the Fairfield Accelerator and Mentor Enterprise (FAME), a business incubator for local entrepreneurs located in downtown Fairfield.[1] Initial FAME entrepreneurs include SoccerGrlProbs, LLC, a company started by three Fairfield University alumnae which took first place in the for-profit track of the 2014 Next Play Venture Pitch Tournament, a national competition for student-led business plans that aim to make the sports industry more sustainable.
In 2015, the school introduced a Master of Business Analytics (MSBA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for careers in business intelligence and quantitative analytics.

Experiential Learning[edit]




Rear of Dolan School of Business


BEST classroom[edit]
The Business Education Simulation & Trading (BEST) classroom provides Dolan School of Business undergraduate and graduate business students the opportunity of working on a financial markets trading floor. The 2,300-square-foot (210 m2) BEST classroom provides students with the experience of dealing with real-world financial market trading situations ranging from case studies and contact with other companies to discussion of economic and business events.
The BEST classroom is equipped with a stock ticker and a data wall displaying real time quotes and 34 workstations loaded with financial software including: RITC (Rotman Interactive Trader) for market trading simulations; Bloomberg Professional with business and economic news and data; Research Insight including Compustat and Global Vantage containing financial information on every publicly trading company in the world; and Center for Research in Security Prices with stock returns for all U.S. companies.
Fairfield Investment Group[edit]
The Fairfield Investment Group received an investment of $100,000 from an anonymous private investor in 2010. With about 20 students researching stocks and making investment decision, the group is an opportunity for them to strengthen trading and analysis skills, prepare for future jobs, and connect with students and alumni.
The club is run by students — most from the Dolan School of Business — and has a management team that includes a chief executive officer, a position held by a senior finance major. The student club assigns members to research companies using Bloomberg terminals, which provide business and economic news and data. Students then work in teams deciding which stocks to invest in or divest from. They submit reports and recommendations to fellow student members serving as portfolio managers and executive leaders, who vote on whether they should buy, sell, or hold.
Fairfield StartUp[edit]
Fairfield StartUp is a yearly program of events designed to assist young entrepreneurs in the creation of their own businesses. The program connects these students with mentors and Fairfield alumni who are already established in the worlds of business, finance and engineering to guide them through the ups and downs of creating a business and pitching it to potential investors. The program culminates each year at the StartUp Showcase, where students negotiate live with investors for seed money to start their businesses.[5]
Community engagement[edit]
Center for Microfinance[edit]
The Center for Microfinance works to help develop self-sustaining business operations in developing countries. In keeping with the Jesuit mission of Fairfield University, Dr. Winston Tellis and Dr. Michael Tucker co-founded the Center in 2001 where they have helped develop self-sustaining businesses in poor rural areas of Haiti and Nicaragua. The center was honored for its work for Haiti's poor by FONKOZE USA (F/USA) which supports Fonkoze (Fondasyon Kole Zepol), Haiti's only alternative bank for the poor. F/USA is one of five non-profit organizations approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to solicit U.S. investments for foreign organizations.
Universidad Centroamericana Partnership[edit]
CMAC is participating in a signed partnership between Fairfield University and the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), in Managua, Nicaragua. UCA sponsors the largest microfinance institution in Nicaragua, Fondo de Desarrollo Local (FDL). Through that organization Dolan School of Business students spent part of the 2005 winter break working at the FDL's León branch office.

Early life[edit]
Dolan was born in Cleveland. The son of an inventor, he served in the U.S. Air Force and studied at John Carroll University before dropping out and entering the telecommunications field.
Career[edit]
His earliest professional endeavors focused on the packaging, marketing and distribution of sports and industrial films. Working together with his wife in their Cleveland home, Dolan edited and produced short film reels of sports events for syndication to television stations. Selling the business, Dolan joined the acquiring firm and moved east to New York.
In the early 1960s, Dolan established Teleguide Inc., which provided information services via cable to New York City hotels. That same decade, he founded Sterling Manhattan Cable, the first urban cable television company in the nation. In its early years, Sterling forged first-of-its-kind agreements to bring New York professional sports teams, cultural programming and movies into the homes of New York City cable viewers.
In the early 1970s, Dolan founded Home Box Office, the first premium programming service in the cable television industry, which he sold to Time Life. Later he organized Cablevision Systems Corporation on Long Island and has spearheaded many of the company's advancements. Most recently, he was the vision behind VOOM, Cablevision's effort to expand content delivery and meet the demands of the exploding HDTV market, which was expected to include 6 million households by the end of 2003—and 12 million by year-end 2005.
From 2001 through early 2002, Dolan was a major bidder in the sale of the Boston Red Sox. Dolan submitted a maximum bid of $750 million,[4] but ultimately lost out to a group headed by John Henry, Tom Werner, and Larry Lucchino.
Dolan is a trustee of Fairfield University and a member of the board of governors of St. Francis Hospital in Port Washington, New York.
In November 2016, Dolan received an honorary doctorate from Fairfield University, "in recognition of his remarkable contribution to our culture industry, for his exemplary vision and tenacity as a media pioneer, and for his important contribution to Fairfield University as a trustee and donor who has supported scholarship funds and the Charles F. Dolan School of Business."[5]
Personal life[edit]
Dolan and his wife, Helen Ann, reside in Oyster Bay, Long Island. They have six children,[1] among them James L. Dolan, a stakeholder in Charles's media properties, and Patrick Dolan, president of Newsday subsidiary News 12 Networks. Charles's younger brother Larry Dolan and nephew Paul Dolan own the Cleveland Indians.
Legacy[edit]
The Fairfield University Dolan School of Business at Fairfield University is named in recognition of his $25 million donation in 2000 and his service to the university as a member of the board of trustees.[6]
The Dolan Center for Science and Technology is John Carroll University's showcase building. Completed in 2003 at a cost of over $66 million, it houses JCU's science departments, including Mathematics and Computer Science.[7]

History[edit]
The Dolan School of Business finds its roots in the Department of Business established in 1947 within the College of Arts and Sciences at Fairfield University. The undergraduate programs received accreditation from the AACSB in 1977. In 1978, the stand-alone Dolan School of Business was founded after the undergraduate programs of the Department of Business were separated from the College of Arts and Sciences and the school began offering a graduate degree program, a Master of Science in Financial Management. The degree was later renamed the Master of Science in Finance (MSF). In 1984, the school introduced its second graduate degree program, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) with concentrations in Accounting, Finance, Human Resource Management, Information Systems and Operations Management, International Business, Marketing, and Taxation.
In 1990, Kevin Conlisk '66 established the Father John Conlisk Irish Scholarship which awards a full-ride every year to an MBA or MSF candidate from the Republic of Ireland to foster cultural exchange and international relations. In 1997, the school received full accreditation for its graduate and undergraduate programs from AACSB International.




Approach to Dolan School of Business


In 2000, the school was renamed the Charles F. Dolan School of Business in recognition of a $25 million gift from Charles F. Dolan, founder of Cablevision Systems Corporation and HBO, and former trustee of the university. The same year, the school moved to a separate on-campus facility containing about 70,000 square feet, including an amphitheater that seats 150, 64 offices, 11 classrooms, and workrooms for student projects. The building had been constructed in 1979 as the Center for Financial Studies in a partnership between Fairfield University and the National Association of Mutual Savings Banks. In 2005, the school formed the Dolan Advisory Council led by John O'Neill '71 (former Senior Partner at Ernst & Young) and consisting of 17 business executives charged with advising and assisting the Dean in the advancement of the Dolan School of Business. In 2006, the school introduced a Master of Science in Accounting (MSA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for a career in accounting and to fulfill the 150-credit hour requirement in most states to take the Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination.
In 2012, the school established its Entrepreneur In Residence Program designed to bring entrepreneurs to the school for a one-year term to share their experiences starting a business. In 2013, the school, in partnership with the Economic Development Department of the Town of Fairfield and Kleban Properties, established the Fairfield Accelerator and Mentor Enterprise (FAME), a business incubator for local entrepreneurs located in downtown Fairfield.[1] Initial FAME entrepreneurs include SoccerGrlProbs, LLC, a company started by three Fairfield University alumnae which took first place in the for-profit track of the 2014 Next Play Venture Pitch Tournament, a national competition for student-led business plans that aim to make the sports industry more sustainable.
In 2015, the school introduced a Master of Business Analytics (MSBA) degree, a full-time one-year program designed to prepare individuals for careers in business intelligence and quantitative analytics.

Experiential Learning[edit]




Rear of Dolan School of Business


BEST classroom[edit]
The Business Education Simulation & Trading (BEST) classroom provides Dolan School of Business undergraduate and graduate business students the opportunity of working on a financial markets trading floor. The 2,300-square-foot (210 m2) BEST classroom provides students with the experience of dealing with real-world financial market trading situations ranging from case studies and contact with other companies to discussion of economic and business events.
The BEST classroom is equipped with a stock ticker and a data wall displaying real time quotes and 34 workstations loaded with financial software including: RITC (Rotman Interactive Trader) for market trading simulations; Bloomberg Professional with business and economic news and data; Research Insight including Compustat and Global Vantage containing financial information on every publicly trading company in the world; and Center for Research in Security Prices with stock returns for all U.S. companies.
Fairfield Investment Group[edit]
The Fairfield Investment Group received an investment of $100,000 from an anonymous private investor in 2010. With about 20 students researching stocks and making investment decision, the group is an opportunity for them to strengthen trading and analysis skills, prepare for future jobs, and connect with students and alumni.
The club is run by students — most from the Dolan School of Business — and has a management team that includes a chief executive officer, a position held by a senior finance major. The student club assigns members to research companies using Bloomberg terminals, which provide business and economic news and data. Students then work in teams deciding which stocks to invest in or divest from. They submit reports and recommendations to fellow student members serving as portfolio managers and executive leaders, who vote on whether they should buy, sell, or hold.
Fairfield StartUp[edit]
Fairfield StartUp is a yearly program of events designed to assist young entrepreneurs in the creation of their own businesses. The program connects these students with mentors and Fairfield alumni who are already established in the worlds of business, finance and engineering to guide them through the ups and downs of creating a business and pitching it to potential investors. The program culminates each year at the StartUp Showcase, where students negotiate live with investors for seed money to start their businesses.[5]
Community engagement[edit]
Center for Microfinance[edit]
The Center for Microfinance works to help develop self-sustaining business operations in developing countries. In keeping with the Jesuit mission of Fairfield University, Dr. Winston Tellis and Dr. Michael Tucker co-founded the Center in 2001 where they have helped develop self-sustaining businesses in poor rural areas of Haiti and Nicaragua. The center was honored for its work for Haiti's poor by FONKOZE USA (F/USA) which supports Fonkoze (Fondasyon Kole Zepol), Haiti's only alternative bank for the poor. F/USA is one of five non-profit organizations approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to solicit U.S. investments for foreign organizations.
Universidad Centroamericana Partnership[edit]
CMAC is participating in a signed partnership between Fairfield University and the Universidad Centroamericana (UCA), in Managua, Nicaragua. UCA sponsors the largest microfinance institution in Nicaragua, Fondo de Desarrollo Local (FDL). Through that organization Dolan School of Business students spent part of the 2005 winter break working at the FDL's León branch office.

The Dolans, the Clan That Built the Cablevision Empire, Say Goodbye

In 1973, Charles Dolan founded what became Cablevision.

Starting with 1,500 subscribers on Long Island more than 40 years ago, the Dolan family built one of America’s cable fortunes.But the Dolans also became the family that New Yorkers often loved to hate: the Dolans, whose Knicks frustrated fans over several fallow decades and whose company engaged in bitter fights with networks that led to blackouts and threatened to keep programming like the Oscars and the World Series out of its customers’ reach.Now the fractious, persistent clan that has loomed large over New York City and Long Island for decades is bidding goodbye to the company that caused so much angst, and that made the family rich.On Thursday the Dolans agreed to sell Cablevision, the cable television empire that Charles F. Dolan started 42 years ago, to Altice, a European media company, for $17 billion, including debt. The family sounded almost wistful about the sale. Continue reading the main story

“Since Charles Dolan founded Cablevision in 1973, the Dolan family has been honored to help shepherd our customers and employees through the most extraordinary communications revolution in modern history,” James L. Dolan, the company’s chief executive and Charles Dolan’s son, said in a statement. “Now, nearly half a century later, the time is right for new ownership of Cablevision and its considerable assets.”Thursday’s sale is a high point in the history of the Dolans, a Midwestern family that moved to New York in the 1950s and established itself as a pioneer in the cable industry. In a city of dynasties, the Dolans stood out for combativeness, willing to fight with the city, with the media companies whose content flows through their cable network — and sometimes with one another.The family is leaving with a hefty payout: The sale to Altice values the Dolans’ collective stake in Cablevision at about $2.2 billion.

With three million customers in the Northeast, Cablevision was never one of the titans of the cable industry. And it has never been particularly loved, earning a mediocre customer satisfaction score in a  survey last year. But it has been the source of cable television and the Internet for millions in the tristate area for years.The Dolans certainly are not going away. They still control the Knicks and the Rangers, as well as Madison Square Garden. And they also control AMC Networks, the home of “The Walking Dead” and other successful shows.

The Dolans’ rise began with Charles Dolan, a Cleveland native who made his way to New York at 26 and founded Teleguide, an information service for hotels. Six years later he started Sterling Manhattan Cable, becoming the first person to wire buildings for cable television access. (In 1971, he founded Home Box Office, which he sold to Time Life.)Two years after starting the company, the elder Dolan sold Sterling Cable’s Manhattan operations to Time Inc. and focused on his 50 miles worth of Long Island assets, renaming them Cablevision Systems.From their stronghold in Bethpage, the Dolans have presided over rises and falls in Cablevision’s fortunes. Once its kingdom stretched over 19 states, though it now focuses on suburban New York.Along the way, the Dolans picked up prized assets like Madison Square Garden and the teams that play in the arena, as well as Newsday, Long Island’s newspaper.In 1995, Charles Dolan handed the reins of the company to James, an unabashedly brash corporate executive, occasional rock singer and avid sailor.Cablevision waged bitter battles against content providers like Disney and Fox.In a fight with ABC in 2010, Cablevision aired ads asking whether its subscribers wanted to prop up the “struggling theme parks” of the channel’s parent, Disney. Then Cablevision let ABC withdraw its channels until the two reached an agreement just as that year’s Oscars telecast started.The Dolans’ stewardship of Madison Square Garden and the Knicks and Rangers has been marked by turbulence as well.Fans frustrated by a lack of championships since the family took ownership in 1994 have targeted James Dolan in particular for meddling too much, particularly with the long-underachieving and turmoil-ridden Knicks.

Yet in familiar fashion, the Dolans were willing to fight hard to protect their interests, notably in 2005 when Cablevision sued to stop the proposed building of a $2.2 billion stadium on the West Side of Manhattan for the Jets. Cablevision spent millions of dollars on ads opposing it.

Cablevision sought a new home for the Garden that would have been part of a $14 billion project to build a new Pennsylvania Station. But the project foundered in 2008, and the family chose to renovate the current Garden for about $1 billion.Fights have broken out within the family as well. Few were more bitter than the battle over Voom, a satellite operator beloved by Charles Dolan and meant to help transform Cablevision into a national service provider. But James Dolan went against his father, and persuaded his fellow directors to put Voom up for sale.Perhaps the family’s biggest defeat came nearly a decade ago when the Dolans sought to take Cablevision private for $10.6 billion, buoyed by billions of dollars in cheap bank debt. Shareholders and analysts revolted, arguing that the family was trying to buy the company on the cheap.Minority investors roundly rejected the bid in 2007.Despite the defeat, the Dolans took to heart a central demand by investors: to split Cablevision into several public companies, letting each business get valued on its own. Since Madison Square Garden and AMC were spun off, their stock prices have more than doubled.“Shareholders were really smart to realize how much value was inside of Cablevision that management ultimately ended up unlocking,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG. “Shareholders forced the Dolans to share that value creation.”Being unpopular hasn’t particularly fazed the family.“Even if your teams are doing lousy and you don’t have a good concert, you are still going to be Madison Square Garden, you are still going to be the ‘showplace of America,’ ” James Dolan once told New York magazine.Since the failed takeover attempt, the Dolans have focused on keeping their company competitive, introducing services like Wi-Fi outside the home and a low-cost mobile phone service. But the company has had to battle rivals like Verizon who have made inroads into its turf.

“They were one of the best-performing cable operators until Verizon got superaggressive and changed the landscape,” Mr. Greenfield said.

In recent months James Dolan has signaled that Cablevision might finally be for sale. Ultimately, it was Altice, a European telecom with ambitions to expand in the United States, that persuaded the Dolans to sell.“We believe that Patrick Drahi and Altice will be truly worthy successors, and we look forward to doing all we can to affect this transition for our customers and employees,” James Dolan said in his statement. “We expect that Cablevision will be in excellent hands.”
