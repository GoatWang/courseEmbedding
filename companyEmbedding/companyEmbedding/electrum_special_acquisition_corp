Electrum Special Acquisition, a blank check company focused on
acquiring companies in the metals and mining industry, raised $175
million by offering 17.5 million units at $10. The SPAC originally
planned to raise $150 million. It now commands a market cap of $213
million, or 13% more than previously anticipated.



Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one warrant, and
warrants entitle the holder to purchase one-half of one ordinary
share at a price of $5.75 per half share. On the 52nd day following
the offering, the common shares and the warrants should begin
trading separately under the tickers ELEC and ELECW, respectively.



The company is led by Thomas Kaplan, a natural resources investor
and Chairman of The Electrum Group. Electrum agreed to purchase
12,450,000 warrants privately at $0.50 per warrant, investing $6.2
million.



Electrum Special Acquisition is listed on the NASDAQ under the
symbol ELECU. Electrum Special Acquisition initially filed
confidentially on n/a. Cantor Fitzgerald acted as a lead manager on
the deal.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price.

Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

We estimate that the net proceeds of this offering, in addition to the funds we
will receive from the sale of the private warrants (all of which will be
deposited into the trust account), will be used as set forth in the following

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we       
    received from an affiliate described below. These funds will be repaid out  
    of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. has agreed to defer $3,375,000 of its underwriting
    commissions (or $4,387,500 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option
    is exercised in full), which equals 2.25% of the gross proceeds from the
    units offered to the public (plus 4.5% of the gross proceeds from the units
    sold in the over-allotment option, if exercised), until consummation of our
    initial business combination. Upon consummation of our initial business
    combination, $3,375,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred
    commissions (or $4,387,500 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
    exercised in full) will be paid to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. from the funds
    held in the trust account. No discounts, commissions or fees will be paid
    with respect to the purchase of the private warrants.

(3) We have agreed to pay advisory fees to Brock Securities LLC in an amount
    equal to 0.75% of up to $150 million of gross proceeds from the offering
    which is payable upon the closing of the offering. This amount excludes
    additional advisory fees payable to that underwriter in an amount equal to
    0.75% of up to $150 million of gross proceeds from the offering which is
    payable upon the closing of our initial business combination (plus, if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, an additional amount equal
    to 1.5% of the gross proceeds from the exercise of the over-allotment
    option), and will be paid from the funds held in the trust account.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account will remain constant at
    $1,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest   
    income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to 
    us to pay income or other tax obligations. We estimate the interest earned  
    on the trust account will be approximately $150,000 over a 24-month period  
    assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.05% per year.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial        
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business    
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of         
    proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated 
    expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates   
    for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess    
    working capital.

Our sponsor and an entity controlled by Mr. Anderson, one of our director
nominees, and their designees have committed to purchase the private warrants
(for an aggregate purchase price of $6,225,000) from us on a private placement
basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Each private
warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of one ordinary share at $5.75
per half share. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $150,000,000, or $172,500,000 if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be placed in an account in the United States at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested only
in United States government treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that
invest solely in U.S. treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business
combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we
have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to TEG, an affiliate of our sponsor, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by TEG for our benefit
and is not intended to provide our officers or directors with compensation in
lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in
New York, New York, that the fee charged by TEG is at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee,
no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, members of our 
management team or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services 
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial 
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). 
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket 
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on 
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses 
to examine their operations. Since the role of present management after our 
initial business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after our initial business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $1,000,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account may be released to us to to pay income or other tax obligations.
The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our shares are used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’s
operations, for development and construction of one or more mining assets, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, ESOF has agreed to pay the funds necessary to
complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than $20,000) and
has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of April 10, 2015, an affiliate of our sponsor loaned to us an aggregate of
$5,281 to be used for entity formation costs. The loan is payable without
interest on the earlier of (i) June 30, 2015, (ii) the date on which we
consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on which we determine
to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loan will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. The notes would either
be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants
at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of
the warrants and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the 
extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of 
our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business 
combination, the loans will not be repaid.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination instead of
conducting a tender offer to allow our public shareholders to seek redemption of
their shares, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for such any transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller
or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not complete a business combination that would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s
“penny stock” rules). The agreement for our business combination, however, may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (2) if that public shareholder
elects to redeem ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to
shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity or (3) if that public
shareholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed
initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.


In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter
intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to
ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience
identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates.
Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources
than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous
potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this
offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses
may be limited by our available financial resources.

The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

• our obligation to seek shareholder approval of our initial business  
  combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a
  transaction;

• our obligation to redeem ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may 
  reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination;

• our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent;

• our obligation to either repay or issue private warrants upon conversion of
  up to $1,000,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our
  sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates; and

• our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the
  private warrants (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our
  sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working 
  capital loans.

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating our initial business combination. Our management believes, however,
that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States
public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held
entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target
business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.

If we succeed in effecting our initial business combination, there will be, in
all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business.
Subsequent to our initial business combination, we may not have the resources or
ability to compete effectively.


Company Description
We are a blank check company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on
December 12, 2014 as a business company with limited liability. This means that
our shareholders have no additional liability for our liabilities over and above
the amount paid for their shares. We were formed for the


 purpose of acquiring,
engaging in a share exchange, share reconstruction and amalgamation, purchasing
all or substantially all of the assets of, entering into contractual
arrangements, or engaging in any other similar business combination, which we
refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination, with
one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this prospectus
as a target business. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational
activities as well as activities related to our offering. We have not selected
any target business on which to concentrate our search for our initial business
combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be
limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although we intend to
focus our search on target businesses and assets in the metals and mining 
industry, with an emphasis on gold and other precious metals.
