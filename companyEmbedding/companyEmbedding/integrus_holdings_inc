Our businesses design, produce, and market tableware solutions to luxury hotels, caterers, commercial kitchens, executive chefs and fine homes.

Our History


Since 1993, we’ve forged our own path, questioned the status quo, and developed superior practices and processes to improve our products and services. When we entered the tableware marketplace, it was an unchanging world of 10” round plates. We set out to redefine those expectations – in 1997 we introduced the game-changing Accentz Collection; in 2001, we developed Fortaluxe® SuperWhite®, an innovative composition of superior quality and color to the commercial and consumer markets.
Today, our multi-brand, multi-channel enterprise encompasses a number of discrete business units, each designed to enhance our ability to deliver comprehensive solutions to the different kinds of customers we serve.
No matter the business platform or the market served we always operate under our core entrepreneurial values: loyalty, integrity, leadership and innovation, and deliver our signature Complete Customer Satisfaction – that fanatical customer solutions focus, for which our company has become known.
No short cuts, no compromises, no “just good enough.” That is the attitude we adapt so that we continue “leading the way”.
