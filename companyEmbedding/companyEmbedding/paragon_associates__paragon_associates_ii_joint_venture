Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D is filed by a joint venture      
formed by (i) Paragon Associates, a Texas limited partnership ("Paragon")       
and (ii) Paragon Associates II, a Texas limited partnership ("Paragon II"),     
as an amendment to the initial statement on Schedule 13D, relating to           
shares of Common Stock of Applied Imaging Corp. (the "Issuer"), as filed        
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") on June 5,

of Paragon and Paragon II and is the authorized agent to the joint venture,     
which is hereinafter referred to as "Paragon JV."                               

The Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented as follows:

Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its      
entirety to read as follows:                                                    

As of January 20, 2000, Paragon JV had invested $1,377,459 in shares

does not have direct beneficial ownership of such shares; however, Mr.          
Dyer, as sole general partner of Paragon and Paragon II, and as agent for       
Paragon JV, may be deemed, for purposes of determining beneficial ownership     
pursuant to Rule 13d-3, to have indirect beneficial ownership of such           
shares.

liabilities of the Metropolitan Claims which shall be retained by, and          
remain solely the obligation of, Old Paragon.  Each party hereto may            
withdraw from the joint venture its share of the assets subject to its          
share of the liabilities at any time.                                           

2.   Old Paragon confirms to Paragon II that Old Paragon intends      
solely to retain and does retain any and all liability which it might have      
with respect to the Metropolitan Claims and Old Paragon hereby indemnifies      
the joint venture and Paragon II and each person or entity who is at any        
time a limited partner of Paragon II against any loss or liability with         
respect to, or resulting from, the Metropolitan Claims and any and all          
costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, which any of them may incur      
in connection with the defense thereof or the enforcement of this               
provision.  Dyer will not permit capital withdrawals from Old Paragon which     
would impair its ability to satisfy any liability which it might have with      
respect to the Metropolitan Claims or with respect to obligations under         
this paragraph 2.                                                               

3.   Dyer, as agent for the joint venture, hereby is authorized to    
open any and all bank, brokerage or other accounts necessary or useful for      
the joint operation of Old Paragon and Paragon II.  Any bank, broker or         
other person may conclusively rely on this agreement as evidence of Dyer's      
authority to so act.                                                            

4.   Old Paragon shall have a _______% interest in the joint venture  
and Paragon II shall have a ________% interest in the joint venture.  Such      
interests are based upon Old Paragon's net worth (net of withdrawals) at        
December 31, 1983 of $_______________ and Paragon II's net worth as of          
January 1, 1984 of $______________.  These sharing ratios will be adjusted      
to reflect any contributions or withdrawals by either Old Paragon or            
Paragon II.  Each of Old Paragon and Paragon II hereby assumes through the      
joint venture a pro rata interest in each contributed asset and liability       
of the other, it is being understood and agreed that no liability with          
respect to the Metropolitan Claims is being assumed through the joint           
venture or otherwise. Further, Old Paragon and Paragon II each agree that       
any gain or loss realized for federal income tax purposes which is              
attributable to unrealized gain or loss existing on January 1, 1984 shall       
be included in the gain or loss of the contributing party.                      

5.   Old Paragon and Paragon II agree that each will separately       
account for its interest in the joint venture and each will separately          
prepare and file all appropriate tax returns.                                   

6.   Dyer, as agent for the joint venture, will make any and all tax  
filings and elections for the joint venture as appropriate to reflect the       
separate and distinct nature of the interests of Old Paragon and Paragon II     
in the joint venture.                                                           

7.   The authority of Dyer, as agent for the accounts of the joint    
venture, shall be the same as his authority with respect to the separate        
assets and liabilities of Old Paragon and Paragon II under the Limited          
Partnership Agreement for Paragon Associates (as amended) and the Limited       
Partnership Agreement for Paragon Associates II.                                

8.   This Agreement shall be effective as of January 1, 1984.  Any    
activity in any account of Old Paragon or Paragon II since that date will       
be deemed to be for the account of the joint venture.                           

9.   Paragraph 2 of this Agreement may not be amended or terminated   
without the prior written consent of each person or entity which becomes a      
limited partner of Paragon II any time on or after January 1, 1984.             

10.  Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Bradbury Dyer III from   
causing the termination of the joint venture when there is no longer            
pending or threatened against Bradbury Dyer III or Paragon Associates any       
Metropolitan Claim.

SCHEDULE 13D/A  This Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D (this Amendment) is being filed on behalf of (i) Paragon Associates and Paragon
Associates II Joint Venture, a joint venture (Paragon JV) formed by Paragon Associates, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership (Paragon), Paragon Associates II, Ltd. a Texas limited partnership (Paragon II), and
Paragon Associates III, Ltd., a Texas limited partnership (Paragon III), (ii) Paragon JV Partners, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Paragon GP), and (iii) Bradbury Dyer III (Mr. Dyer, and
collectively with Paragon JV and Paragon GP, the Reporting Persons). This Schedule 13D relates to shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), of CareDx, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
Issuer). This Amendment modifies the original Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 25, 2015 (the Original 13D) relating to shares of Common Stock of the Issuer.  This Amendment relates to Common Stock purchased by Mr. Dyer for the account of Paragon JV on behalf of Paragon, Paragon II and Paragon
III. Paragon GP serves as the general partner of each of Paragon, Paragon II and Paragon III and the investment advisor of Paragon JV and may direct the vote and disposition of the 1,683,800 shares of Common Stock (including 210,000 warrants to
purchase shares of Common Stock (the Warrants)) held by the Paragon JV. As the sole and managing member of Paragon GP, Mr. Dyer may direct Paragon GP to direct, and, as the authorized agent to Paragon JV, may direct, the vote and
disposition of the 1,683,800 shares of Common Stock (including 210,000 Warrants) held by Paragon JV.    Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its
entirety to read as follows:  The net investment costs (including commissions, if any) of the shares of Common Stock and Warrants
purchased by the Reporting Persons is $7,137,432.90. The source of these funds was the working capital of the Reporting Persons.    Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer Item 5 of the Schedule 13D is hereby amended and
restated in its entirety to read as follows:  (a) As of September 22, 2016, Paragon JV, by virtue of carrying out the purposes of
Paragon, Paragon II and Paragon III per the joint venture agreement of Paragon JV, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 2 to the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons on November 2, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference, as
subsequently amended by the First Amendment thereto, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 3 to the Schedule 13D/A filed by the Reporting Persons on July 27, 2015 and incorporated herein by reference, beneficially owns 1,683,800 shares of Common
Stock (including 210,000 Warrants), which represents 7.9% of the Issuers outstanding shares of Common Stock.  The percentage of
ownership of the Reporting Persons, as reported in this Amendment was calculated by dividing (i) 1,683,800 shares of Common Stock owned by Paragon JV, which consists of (a) 1,473,800 shares of Common Stock and (b) Warrants presently
exercisable for 210,000 shares of Common Stock by (ii) the sum of (x) 18,976,343 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of July 29, 2016 based upon the Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 22,
2016, (y) 2,250,000 shares of new Common Stock issued based upon the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 21, 2016 and (z) 210,000, the number of shares of Common Stock receivable by the Reporting
Persons upon exercise of presently exercisable warrants.  Paragon GP does not have direct beneficial ownership of the 1,683,800 shares (including the
Warrants) of the Issuers Common Stock; however, Paragon GP, as the general partner of each of Paragon, Paragon II and Paragon III, may be deemed, for purposes of determining beneficial ownership pursuant to Rule 13d-3, to have indirect
beneficial ownership of such shares.  Mr. Dyer does not have direct beneficial ownership of the 1,683,800 shares (including the
Warrants) of the Issuers Common Stock; however, Mr. Dyer, as sole and managing member of Paragon GP, and as agent for Paragon JV, may be deemed, for purposes of determining beneficial ownership pursuant to Rule 13d-3, to have indirect
beneficial ownership of such shares.  (b) Paragon JV has the power to vote and dispose of the 1,683,800 shares (including the
Warrants) of Common Stock it holds; Paragon GP, as the general partner of each of Paragon, Paragon II and Paragon III, has the power to vote and dispose of the 1,683,800 shares (including the Warrants) of Common Stock held by Paragon JV; and

hereto.  (d) Not Applicable.  (e) Not Applicable.    Item 6.
