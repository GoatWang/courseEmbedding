Please contact Broadridge for transfers, address changes, or any other questions regarding Praxsyn Corporation shares of stock. What if I hold shares through my broker? Am I a registered shareholder? Do I still need to contact Broadridge?If your stock is held at your brokerage firm, you do not need to contact Broadridge because a transfer agent does not keep track of shares traded or held through brokerage accounts. Stocks that are held in a brokerage account are considered to be held in "street name," which means that those shares are held on behalf of the stockholder by the broker. In this case, the transfer agent considers the brokerage to be the registered shareholder. It is the responsibility of the brokerage firm to keep track of the accounts of their clients and to provide those clients with information regarding their Praxsyn shares.Does Praxsyn put limits on company information being released by the transfer agent?Praxsyn has not given any special instructions to the transfer agent to withhold any information that shareholders are legally entitled to receive.   On what exchange does Praxsyn trade and what is its ticker symbol?Shares of Praxsyn Common stock are quoted on the OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol PXYN.Are you still factoring your receivables?We provide this information in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please visit our SEC Filings Archive page to refer to our most recent report.When does Praxsyn report earnings?Our financial information is released in our quarterly reports which are due in the months of May, August, and November, and our yearly report during the month of March.  However, such filing dates may be changed due to extensions, holidays, and etc.  These reports can be found on the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website by searching in the company field using the words PXYN or Praxsyn.How can shareholders reach out to Praxsyn Representatives? Please contact Investor Relations at (949) 777-6112 or by email at ir@praxsyn.com.When should we expect to see press releases?Press releases are disseminated to the public when a material event or change occurs that warrants a news release. Why doesn’t Praxsyn release regular monthly sales and other financial updates in the form of press releases?We release sales and financial updates in our quarterly and year end filings. Public companies do not typically release monthly earnings in press releases because they are neither audited nor reviewed.

Ad by Insta ShareXXAd by Insta ShareXX      Update to Letter to Praxsyn Corporation’s Shareholders from its Chairman and CEO    Praxsyn Corporation GlobeNewswire     ?   	      IRVINE, Calif., June 21, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Praxsyn Corporation (PXYN) published a letter on April 15, 2016 to its shareholders from Greg Sundem, its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.  This letter is from Mr. Sundem to update the Company’s shareholders as to the Company’s business and operations as of this date.  Dear Shareholders, I wanted to take an opportunity to update you as to our delay in filing our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2015, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the Quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Regrettably, we are delayed in our filings due to being in the final phase of our business reorganization and restructure of our operations.  I anticipate that the strong measures that I have instituted will have an overall positive effect on the Company.  To that end, since my last letter to the shareholders, we have:  Commenced taking new prescriptions that do not require any upfront marketing costs, allowing us to greatly reduce the front end cost of new receivables. 	I, together with our CFO/COO, and General Counsel/Secretary have deferred salaries until the Company’s overall cash flow has improved, however, as the rate of collections on our existing accounts receivable is rapidly increasing, this deferral is projected to end within the next few payroll cycles. 	Commenced negotiations to restructure our long term debt. 	Commenced the planning of establishing our first pharmacy outside the state of California.  In the next few weeks, we plan to  Publish our Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ended December 31, 2015, and shortly thereafter publish our Form 10-Q for the Quarter ended March 31, 2016. 	Commence our California sales of workers’ compensation cases that are pre-approved. 	Commence auxiliary sales into out of state markets with what we believe will have substantially faster payment on claims.  In order to further increase our shareholder value, we are still planning to:  Acquire or become an FDA approved and fully licensed drug manufacturing facility so that we may offer products that we may sell to other pharmacies, hospitals and clinics. 	Pursue accretive acquisitions of laboratories, and other medical providers who enjoy rapid claims payments. 	Further diversify into additional medical industry profit centers.  Finally, we plan to vastly improve communications with our shareholders. To this end we plan to:  Frequently release company news through press releases. 	Hold investor teleconferences or comprehensive press releases along with the release of each subsequent Annual and Quarterly filing. 	Hire a staff member only dedicated to Investor Relations.  About Praxsyn Corporation Headquartered in Irvine, California, Praxsyn works to realize the vision of medical professionals to improve the lives of patients. Mesa Pharmacy, a wholly owned subsidiary, provides doctors along with traditional medical treatments, with an alternative to oral pain medications. Mesa focuses on providing custom compounded non-narcotic, transdermal topical pain medications that are marketed to industrial health physicians and medical clinics. Mesa has developed a series of topical creams, in different strengths, that provide the pain relief doctors seek for their patients. Additional company information can be found at www.praxsyn.com. Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements made in this press release are forward-looking in nature (within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) including but not limited to statements regarding the past and future performance, past and future operations, expected cash on hand and anticipated results of the Company, accordingly, are subject to risks and uncertainties. The actual results may differ materially from those described or contemplated and consequently, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Certain of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in the reports we filed with the SEC. Contact:   Contact Media/Investor Contact: IR@PraXsyn.com 949-777-6112 ext 101         Letter to Praxsyn Corporation’s Shareholders from its Chairman and CEO           Praxsyn CorporationApril 15, 2016 2:28 PMGlobeNewswire          ? ? ? ?                  IRVINE, Calif., April 15, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Praxsyn Corporation (PXYN) announces today it will publish a Letter to its shareholders from its Chairman and CEO regarding the company’s business and operations.       Dear Shareholders, On March 31, 2016, I accepted the position as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer. Unfortunately, due to many factors, the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year ending December 31, 2015, which was due on that same date, will not be filed in a timely manner.  We took the available 15 day extension, however even with the extension, we will still need additional time to complete our Annual Report. During 2015, we generated a substantial working capital deficit. We are delaying the filing of our Form 10-K in order to finish reorganizing our operations in order to dramatically reduce our deficit.  Prior to the release of the Annual Report, we have or will have:  Negotiated settlements with our vendors to reduce our marketing related debt by at least $5,000,000; 	Reduced inefficiencies in executive staff in order to massively reduce overhead, cutting more than $500,000 in annual payroll, and currently myself, our CFO/COO and our General Counsel/Secretary are deferring salaries until the company’s overall cash flow is improved; and 	Written down certain other assets, in order to eliminate any 2015 income tax liability.   	   However, to ensure that this situation will not repeated, we will no longer process workers’ compensation related prescriptions unless our costs are fully funded prior to the date of service. In order to further increase our shareholder value, we plan in the future to:  Expand our sales efforts more fully into private insurance markets where payment is pre-approved by insurance carriers; 	Pursue workers’ compensation cases that are already pre-approved; 	Enter into negotiations with insurance carriers in order to dramatically reduce reimbursement rates, thereby ensuring prompt payment of all claims. If successful, we will reduce the cost of care for our patients, their insurers and ultimately their employers as well; 	Become fully licensed in all 50 states as soon as practicable; 	Expeditiously eliminate our long term debt; 	Contract with marketing groups in other states to more fully diversify our product lines and markets; 	Acquire an FDA approved and fully licensed drug manufacturing facility so that we may offer patients pain management creams (and other products) at massively reduced prices, under single NDC numbers, so that we sell to other pharmacies, hospitals and clinics; 	Pursue accretive acquisitions of laboratories, and other medical providers who enjoy rapid claims payments; and 	Further diversify into additional medical industry profit centers.   	   Finally, we plan to vastly improve communications with our shareholders. To this end we plan to:  Frequently release company news through regular press releases; 	Hold investor teleconferences with the release of each subsequent annual and quarterly filing; and 	Hire dedicated Investor Relations staff.   	   The last two years have seen many great strides and many setbacks for the Company and its shareholders, however, current management intends to bring a renewed focus on increasing shareholder value.

The pharmacy features more than 8,000 square feet of pharmacy and warehouse space. The total purchase price for the acquisition of the pharmacy was $120,000. Praxsyn CEO and Chairman of the Board Greg Sundem commented, "This acquisition will allow us to sell a broader mix of products from a much larger facility than we have had in the past. Our focus is on filling prescriptions that have a 30-day pay cycle instead of the multiple year collection cycles that we have experienced in the past."
