Patriot Power Greens – Full Review & Special Discount 


































Patriot Power Greens ReviewThe TRUTH About Patriot Greens!Patriot Power Greens – Full Review & Special Discount
Getting proper nutrition, including all of your daily recommended fruits and vegetables and vitamins can take a lot of work.
This is especially important as we get older…
The problem is – lets face it, unless you keep your house stocked with organic vegetables it can be tricky getting all your daily recommended servings and all those vitamins and antioxidants everybody keeps talking about all the time.
The solution?
Visit the Official Website To Claim Your Special (Lowest Price) Discount on Patriot Power Greens Now..
A Texan doctor named Dr. Lane Sebring M.D. and Patriot Health Alliance have teamed up to make a new green-superfood drink called “Patriot Power Greens” that offers an easy way to get a ton of nutritional value, in one small serving of juice.
The product is unique in that it contains only organic, non-GMO ingredients and because it has been formulated by a doctor who is highly regarded as a leading anti-aging expert.
What Exactly Is This “Patriot Power Greens” Drink All About?
Patriot Power Greens creator Dr. Lane Sebring
Patriot Power Greens is an all natural blend of 21 organic fruits and vegetables, 10 probiotic strains, and 6 digestive enzymes that comes as a green-drink powder that you mix with water, juice, or even into a smoothie…
Dr. Sebring, who formulated the juice is a medical doctor, anti-aging specialist, and board examiner for the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. He created the drink to help neutralize the excess acid and inflammation that he asserts can trigger an assortment of common age related maladies.
What Are The Ingredients In Patriot Power Greens?
Patriot Power Greens contains:
organic apple
organic kale
organic broccoli
organic spinach
organic carrot
organic parsley
organic beet
organic green cabbage
organic blueberry
organic raspberry
organic strawberry
organic tomato
organic spirulina
organic blue agave inulin
beet juice powder
Acai
Goji
Amia fruit extract
Spirulina
Kombu seaweed
Nori seaweed
Wakame seaweed
The 10 probiotic strains
The 6 digestive enzymes
and more.. (see image at right)
Patriot Power Greens Benefits:
1 – Health Benefits Galore!* – Numerous studies indicate that the ingredients in Patriot Power Greens can have numerous highly positive effects on the human body*.
2 – Superior Taste. One thing those who have tried Power Greens seem to agree on is that the taste is superior to other green health drinks which commonly have strong grassy, earthy tones. I’m drinking a glass right now as I write this, to make sure that I describe it accurately. Basically it is just very light, lightly sweet, with a mild berry flavor and just the slightest hint of greensy-ness. Overall I find the immediate experience of drinking it refreshing.
3 – Organic, non-GMO, no soy, etc… One of the best things about this product is what it DOESN’T have in it. No pesticides, no heavy metals, none of that scary stuff. It’s even suitable for vegetarians. Here’s a list of some of the icky things that Patriot Power Greens makes sure to keep out of it’s product:
– No gluten
– No wheat
– No dairy
– No eggs
– No soy
– No shellfish
– No egg
– No fish
– No tree nuts
– No peanuts
– No artificial sweeteners
– No caffeine
– No GMO ingredients
4 – Drinking Patriot Power Greens floods your body with powerful nutrients, micro-nutrients, phytochemicals, probiotics and digestive enzymes.
Patriot Power Greens Compared:
When compared to the other leading green-drinks on the market Patriot Power Greens differnetiates itself in a number of ways. One key difference is that many greens powders use cheaper and less nutritious ingredients like wheatgrass, barley and soy to bulk up, even though these ingredients can, according to Dr Sebring, actuallycause the same kind of inflammation we are looling to avoid!
Patriot Power Greens on the other hand has a far greater nutritional density, which means a more powerful dose of nutrients, phytochemicals, and probiotics.

Product Safety

The Patriot Health Alliance guarantees all of their ingredients are processed in an FDA registered facility certified in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and that they go through 3 levels of inspection before being shipped out. You may likely be reassured to know that such care is put into ensuring the purity of Patriot Greens, especially when many supplement companies are known to take “shortcuts” in this area.
Indeed, while Patriot Health sources their ingredients from established and tightly monitored organic farms, many other companies get their ingredients from polluted foreign regions where they are available at rock bottom prices. I for one think it makes a lot more sense to go with the higher quality ingredients even if it ends up costing a few more pennies per serving. After all the whole point of a drink like Power Greens is to give your body what it wants and needs for optimal function.
Take a gander at how the Patriot Health Greens compare with other greens powders on the market…

Is There A “Satisfaction Guarantee” For Patriot Power Greens?:
Patriot Health Alliance guarantees all customers a 100% moneyback guarantee that is a Lifetime Guarantee (which means that you are guaranteed for LIFE, Patriot Health also provides extremely responsive customer service should you need to get in touch.)

Patriot Power Greens – Full Review & Special Discount 


































Patriot Power Greens ReviewThe TRUTH About Patriot Greens!Patriot Power Greens – Full Review & Special Discount
Getting proper nutrition, including all of your daily recommended fruits and vegetables and vitamins can take a lot of work.
This is especially important as we get older…
The problem is – lets face it, unless you keep your house stocked with organic vegetables it can be tricky getting all your daily recommended servings and all those vitamins and antioxidants everybody keeps talking about all the time.
The solution?
Visit the Official Website To Claim Your Special (Lowest Price) Discount on Patriot Power Greens Now..
A Texan doctor named Dr. Lane Sebring M.D. and Patriot Health Alliance have teamed up to make a new green-superfood drink called “Patriot Power Greens” that offers an easy way to get a ton of nutritional value, in one small serving of juice.
The product is unique in that it contains only organic, non-GMO ingredients and because it has been formulated by a doctor who is highly regarded as a leading anti-aging expert.
What Exactly Is This “Patriot Power Greens” Drink All About?
Patriot Power Greens creator Dr. Lane Sebring
Patriot Power Greens is an all natural blend of 21 organic fruits and vegetables, 10 probiotic strains, and 6 digestive enzymes that comes as a green-drink powder that you mix with water, juice, or even into a smoothie…
Dr. Sebring, who formulated the juice is a medical doctor, anti-aging specialist, and board examiner for the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine. He created the drink to help neutralize the excess acid and inflammation that he asserts can trigger an assortment of common age related maladies.
What Are The Ingredients In Patriot Power Greens?
Patriot Power Greens contains:
organic apple
organic kale
organic broccoli
organic spinach
organic carrot
organic parsley
organic beet
organic green cabbage
organic blueberry
organic raspberry
organic strawberry
organic tomato
organic spirulina
organic blue agave inulin
beet juice powder
Acai
Goji
Amia fruit extract
Spirulina
Kombu seaweed
Nori seaweed
Wakame seaweed
The 10 probiotic strains
The 6 digestive enzymes
and more.. (see image at right)
Patriot Power Greens Benefits:
1 – Health Benefits Galore!* – Numerous studies indicate that the ingredients in Patriot Power Greens can have numerous highly positive effects on the human body*.
2 – Superior Taste. One thing those who have tried Power Greens seem to agree on is that the taste is superior to other green health drinks which commonly have strong grassy, earthy tones. I’m drinking a glass right now as I write this, to make sure that I describe it accurately. Basically it is just very light, lightly sweet, with a mild berry flavor and just the slightest hint of greensy-ness. Overall I find the immediate experience of drinking it refreshing.
3 – Organic, non-GMO, no soy, etc… One of the best things about this product is what it DOESN’T have in it. No pesticides, no heavy metals, none of that scary stuff. It’s even suitable for vegetarians. Here’s a list of some of the icky things that Patriot Power Greens makes sure to keep out of it’s product:
– No gluten
– No wheat
– No dairy
– No eggs
– No soy
– No shellfish
– No egg
– No fish
– No tree nuts
– No peanuts
– No artificial sweeteners
– No caffeine
– No GMO ingredients
4 – Drinking Patriot Power Greens floods your body with powerful nutrients, micro-nutrients, phytochemicals, probiotics and digestive enzymes.
Patriot Power Greens Compared:
When compared to the other leading green-drinks on the market Patriot Power Greens differnetiates itself in a number of ways. One key difference is that many greens powders use cheaper and less nutritious ingredients like wheatgrass, barley and soy to bulk up, even though these ingredients can, according to Dr Sebring, actuallycause the same kind of inflammation we are looling to avoid!
Patriot Power Greens on the other hand has a far greater nutritional density, which means a more powerful dose of nutrients, phytochemicals, and probiotics.

Product Safety

The Patriot Health Alliance guarantees all of their ingredients are processed in an FDA registered facility certified in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and that they go through 3 levels of inspection before being shipped out. You may likely be reassured to know that such care is put into ensuring the purity of Patriot Greens, especially when many supplement companies are known to take “shortcuts” in this area.
Indeed, while Patriot Health sources their ingredients from established and tightly monitored organic farms, many other companies get their ingredients from polluted foreign regions where they are available at rock bottom prices. I for one think it makes a lot more sense to go with the higher quality ingredients even if it ends up costing a few more pennies per serving. After all the whole point of a drink like Power Greens is to give your body what it wants and needs for optimal function.
Take a gander at how the Patriot Health Greens compare with other greens powders on the market…

Is There A “Satisfaction Guarantee” For Patriot Power Greens?:
Patriot Health Alliance guarantees all customers a 100% moneyback guarantee that is a Lifetime Guarantee (which means that you are guaranteed for LIFE, Patriot Health also provides extremely responsive customer service should you need to get in touch.)
