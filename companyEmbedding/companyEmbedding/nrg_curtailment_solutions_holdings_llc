True Architects of Demand ResponseIn the energy world, we view big challenges as opportunities to provide big solutions. That’s the approach NRG Curtailment Solutions (NRGCS) brings to the Demand Response programs we’ve been administering, designing, recommending and delivering to thousands of customers since 2003.
As demand for electricity surges, so does the pressure on companies to reduce their energy costs and on utilities to respond to capacity or reserve shortfalls. All this pressure leads to us delivering Demand Response programs that benefit customers and utilities in measurable ways.

Reliable Solutions
Our programs allow you to reduce your usage without impairing your critical day to day business operations. Learn how below.
The Proof is in Our ProcessWhile every demand response program we deliver is uniquely suited to the needs of our customers, the hallmarks of our overall approach can be summarized in this typical sequence of events:

Knowledge – Each customer receives a meter or device upgrade to track electricity use in real-time. This gives us access to your interval data, while allowing you to view your interval demands and kWh usage for improved energy management.
Strategy – Based on your energy consumption patterns and daily business operations, we can develop a real-world reduction strategy – one that is based on employee knowledge of Demand Response procedures.
Communication – In the event of an electric grid crisis or predicted supply shortage, the grid operator or utility will alert us of the need for emergency demand response action.
Action – Your designated event contact will be notified and will begin implementation of the prescribed reduction strategy.
Measurement – Your performance is determined by your reduction of electric demand from a previously calculated baseline. In some markets, reduction is measured against demand from the prior year’s peak hours. In others, it may be measured against a demand average from recent weeks, days or even hours.
Reward – At the conclusion of the demand response season, you receive payments based on the total kW reduction your company achieved during the designated time periods.

Contact Us TodayTo learn more about custom-built Demand Response solutions for your business.
Learn MoreCurtailment TipsOur customers use a wide variety of tactics to reduce their energy usage. Below are a few quick and easy ways to reduce your watts:

Generators – Make sure generators are fully fueled and connected to as much load as practical.
Equipment – Determine which processes can be shut down for 1-4 hours during an event. Make sure equipment operators are aware of what to do when an event takes place.
Elevators – Take some elevators off duty. Have “out of service” signs ready to place on every floor.
Chillers – Investigate options for running chillers at reduced capacity. These vary to fit your facility’s needs.
Lights – Identify all areas where lighting can be safely reduced. Label switches that are to be turned off during events.
Thermostat – Raise your thermostat six degrees during an event.

 Home  |  Utilities
UtilitiesWe design, develop and implement
custom-created Demand Response programs
for utilities across North America, taking into account
the specific needs of each territory.
The Power to DeliverOutside of developing Demand Response programs that work for energy intensive companies, we also work directly with utilities to offer programs that appeal to end-users, regulators and stakeholders alike.
Our 5-Phase Approach balances the interests of both utilities and end-users, resulting in a program that works for everyone:

Program Design/Consulting → This is where we customize the framework of the program, including performance measurements, payment structures, event triggers, hours and notification, compensation/revenue allocation and settlement processes.
Marketing and Enrollment → This area involves the identification of prospects, branding, creation and distribution of necessary materials, staff training, enrollment/certification requirements, affiliate relationships and seminars/webinars.
Pre-Event Assessment and Readiness → In our experience, preparedness is key to success. Here, that includes three main areas: Metering Platform Deployment, Demand Response Audits/Site Surveys and Reduction Action Plans.
Event Activations → To ensure success in a reduction event, two areas take hold: Automated client notification and resource interaction. Customer outreach and communication is conducted in real-time to ensure our portfolio is performing at full capacity.
Post-Event Analysis and Communication → Once a reduction event is over, this step begins and involves data reconciliation and performance analysis.

The non-guarantor subsidiaries include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries, including GenOn and its subsidiaries. NRG 
conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with 
respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its 
subsidiaries. Except for NRG Bayou Cove, LLC, which is subject to certain restrictions under the Company's Peaker financing agreements, there are no 
restrictions on the ability of any of the guarantor subsidiaries to transfer funds to NRG. In addition, there may be restrictions for certain non-guarantor 
subsidiaries. 
The following condensed consolidating financial information presents the financial information of NRG Energy, Inc., the guarantor subsidiaries and 
the non-guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation S-X. The financial information

	Item 1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.





	 




	On January 24, 2017, NRG Energy, Inc. (

	NRG

	), as borrower, completed an amendment to its senior secured credit facility (the 

	Senior Credit Facilities

	) pursuant to the terms of the First Amendment Agreement, dated as of January 24, 2017 (the 

	Amendment Agreement

	), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2016 (the 

	Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement

	), to reduce the margin on certain borrowings under its Senior Credit Facilities.




	 




	Borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are determined at NRGs election, at LIBOR or at base rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin. The Amendment Agreement decreases the applicable margins for borrowings under (i) ABR Term Loans from 1.75% to 1.25% and (ii) Eurodollar Term Loans from 2.75% to 2.25%, as such terms are defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The decreases to the applicable margins became effective upon execution of the Amendment Agreement.




	 




	The foregoing description of the Amendment Agreement is a summary and is therefore qualified in its entirety by the complete text of the Amendment Agreement, filed as exhibit 10.1 to this report and incorporated herein by reference.

	) and as collateral agent (in such capacity and together with its successors, the 

	Collateral Agent

	).



	 




	A.            Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Agreement (as defined below).

	E.            Each Lender that executes and delivers a signature page to this Amendment on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date (as defined below) (the 

	Accordingly, in consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the sufficiency and receipt of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:




	 





	SECTION 1. 


	Amendments to Credit Agreement

	.




	 




	(i) Section 1.01 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended or, as the case may be, amended and restated by:




	 





	(A) 

	adding thereto the following new defined terms in proper alphabetical order:




	 




	

	Replacement Lender

	) under such document, solely upon the consent and acceptance by the Replacement Lender.  The Replacement Lender has executed and delivered a signature page to this First Amendment on or prior to the First Amendment Effective Date as a Consenting Lender.
