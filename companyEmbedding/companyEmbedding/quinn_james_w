BackgroundJim Quinn is an accomplished trial lawyer who served for many years as head of the Litigation Department of the international law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges. Mr. Quinn specializes in high stakes commercial disputes. He has practiced in all areas of complex litigation and alternative dispute resolution, with particular emphasis on antitrust, securities, false advertising, sports, entertainment, patent and related complex intellectual property litigation. Known for his judgment, thorough preparation and mastery of detail, Mr. Quinn is able to take command of the courtroom with penetrating cross-examination of witnesses and logically compelling arguments. Clients call upon him in matters that are high-profile, high-stakes and, often, international in scope.
Mr. Quinn’s most recent notable engagements include obtaining for CBS the dismissal with prejudice of a landmark putative class action in which current and former NCAA Division I college football and basketball players alleged that CBS, along with a host of college athletic conferences, other networks and licensors, profited from the broadcast and use of those Student-Athletes’ names, likenesses and images without permission; winning for CBS Corporation the dismissal, affirmed on appeal, of a putative securities fraud class action relating to a $14 billion impairment; obtaining a complete dismissal for ESPN, Inc. and certain Walt Disney Co. companies in a $130 million suit brought by Echostar concerning alleged contract breaches relating to rights to ESPN and Disney’s high-definition television networks; securing a complete dismissal for CBS Corporation in a $70 million breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty suit filed by its former anchorman and correspondent Dan Rather stemming from his departure from the network in 2006; on behalf of ExxonMobil, defeating class certification of a purported national class alleging that major petroleum companies conspired to restrict the supply of gasoline; and securing summary judgment for ESPN, Inc. in litigation against boxing promoter Don King who alleged defamation and false light invasion of privacy and sought $2.5 billion in damages.
In another recent and high-profile matter, he served as lead trial counsel for ExxonMobil during a three-month trial in New Hampshire state court of claims brought by the State of New Hampshire relating to the use of the chemical MTBE as a gasoline additive. Earlier, he served as co-lead counsel for Vivendi in In re Vivendi Universal, S.A. Securities Litigation, the largest shareholder class action ever to go to trial.
Mr. Quinn recently succeeded in winning dismissal of $100 million in shareholder claims against Vivendi; convinced a federal court in California to deny class certification in a $500 million lawsuit filed against CBS regarding college athlete photos being sold on the internet, ultimately winning dismissal of the entire case on the merits; obtained dismissal of a series of lawsuits filed against Marvel Entertainment, Inc. potentially worth billions of dollars regarding many of the most iconic comic book characters owned by Marvel, in which the courts ordered the plaintiffs to pay almost a half million dollars in legal fees to Marvel; and represented Powder Corp., a major operator of ski resorts, in a high-profile dispute over the ownership of the Park City Mountain Ski Resort.
Throughout the past decade and beyond, Mr. Quinn has established himself as a leading commercial litigator with a string of impressive wins, including a $417 million verdict for ExxonMobil (Exxon Mobil v. SABIC) which was among the largest verdicts in the United States in 2003 and remains the largest in a commercial case in Delaware’s history; a complete defense verdict for Procter & Gamble Co. on an $80 million false advertising claim brought by the Colgate-Palmolive Co., relating to home teeth-whitening products; and representation of the Arthur Andersen Worldwide Member Firms in the largest International Chamber of Commerce arbitration in history, which involved nearly 300 parties and almost $15 billion in claims. During this time, Mr. Quinn also scored significant wins for UnitedHealth Group, Johnson & Johnson, and Disney, among others.
Additionally, Mr. Quinn has earned a reputation with his clients for his unmatched experience in sports and entertainment litigation. He is the most successful and influential litigator of sports antitrust cases in the quarter-century that these cases have been played out in the national arena. He is known for his strategic personal assessment of each client and his keen execution of the facts in the courtroom. Mr. Quinn has counseled and represented players associations in Major League Baseball, the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and Major League Soccer. Mr. Quinn served as the lead counsel for the NFL players in their successful antitrust challenge to the player restrictions in the League (McNeil v. NFL). In this three month jury trial, Mr. Quinn ensured that a fair jury was chosen for his clients, and his winning strategy secured for his clients a multi-million dollar treble damage verdict as well as the right to free agency. He is able to make juries understand complicated cases by presenting his client’s points in a readily comprehensible and persuasive manner. The New York Times labeled Mr. Quinn’s participation at trial as “instrumental in helping change the face of major professional sports.” In 2016, Mr. Quinn was named as one of 17 “Elite” Power Players for sports law by Sports Business Journal.
Among many honors and awards, Mr. Quinn was selected in 1993 and 2004 by The National Law Journal as one of the ten top trial lawyers in the United States in its annual feature, “Winning: Successful Strategies From 10 of the Nation’s Top Litigators” (only a handful of lawyers have ever been selected twice for this prestigious award).
Chambers USA has ranked Mr. Quinn as a leader in nationwide sports law and New York commercial litigation since 2005, and as a top U.S. trial attorney since 2010. In 2013, he received the Chambers USA “Award for Excellence” in the category of “Litigation: Business Trial Lawyer” after being shortlisted for the award since 2009; he subsequently has been named to the shortlist for the inaugural, 2014 edition of “The Chambers 100,” a list of the top 100 business lawyers in the United States. Additionally, he has been ranked as a leading trial lawyer by Chambers Global in 2004/2005 and 2009-2016, with client commentators describing him as “an outstanding lawyer” and “one of the greatest trial lawyers in the country.” Legal 500 also recognized Mr. Quinn as a Leading Trial Lawyer since 2011, and separately in the areas of Appellate, Commercial Litigation, Sports and Antitrust, with commentators calling him a “legendary litigator.” He was also listed as highly recommended in PLC Which Lawyer? Yearbook 2006-2009 for Dispute Resolution, and was included in Euromoney’s 2004 Guide to the World’s Leading Experts In Commercial Arbitration, and The International Who’s Who of Commercial Litigators 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2013. Mr. Quinn has been selected by his peers for inclusion in the 2009-2016 editions of The Best Lawyers in America in a number of specialty areas, including Bet-the-Company Litigation, Commercial Litigation, International Arbitration, Litigation – Antitrust, Litigation – IP, Litigation – Securities and Sports Law. Benchmark Litigation recognized Mr. Quinn as one of its Top 100 Trial Lawyers in its 2016 and 2017 editions, and has also recognized him as a “Local Litigation Star” and a national “Litigation Star” since 2010, including in the areas of General Commercial Litigation and Securities Litigation, among others. In 2013, Mr. Quinn was recognized as a “Client Service All-Star” in BTI Consulting Group’s annual survey of corporate counsel. In 2015, Mr. Quinn was again elected by vote of his peers as one of the Top 100 Lawyers in the Metro New York area by Super Lawyers.
Mr. Quinn is a Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers and the American College of Trial Lawyers and a member of the International Society of Barristers. He is also a Fellow of The New York Bar Foundation. He has chaired a variety of committees of both The American Bar Association and The Bar Association of The City of New York. He is a member of the Advisory Board of The National Judicial College and the Panel of Distinguished Neutrals of the Center for Public Resources.
Representative Matters
Stan Lee Media v. Marvel Inc., et al. – Successfully dismissed a series of copyright lawsuits filed around the country asserting ownership claims to many of Marvel’s most valuable characters, including Spider Man, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk, Iron Man, and dozens of others, and obtained attorney fees awards worth nearly half a million dollars in favor of Marvel.
Javon Marshall, et al. v. ESPN, Inc., CBS Broadcasting, Inc., et al. – Lead counsel for CBS in obtaining dismissal with prejudice of putative nationwide right of publicity and antitrust class action regarding names, images, and likenesses of student-athletes in college football and basketball broadcasts.
Yahchaaroah Lightbourne et al. v. CBS Interactive – Defeated motion for class certification and obtained ultimate dismissal of a putative class action seeking a half billion dollars in damages for the alleged violation of college athletes rights of publicity in connection with the sale of their photographs on the internet.
City of Omaha v. CBS Corp. – Obtained dismissal, affirmed by the Second Circuit, of putative securities fraud class action concerning a $14 billion impairment.
EchoStar, Inc. v. ESPN, Inc., et al. – Lead trial lawyer in a multiweek jury trial in New York State Supreme Court representing defendants ESPN, Inc. and related Walt Disney Companies. Plaintiff EchoStar sought over $130 million in damages for alleged contract breaches relating to rights to ESPN and Disney’s high-definition television networks. The jury rejected all of plaintiff’s claims and rendered a complete defense verdict on behalf of ESPN and Disney.
Eventim LLP v. Live Nation, Inc. – Lead lawyer for claimant Eventim seeking nearly a billion dollars in damages for breach of contract and breach of the covenant good faith and fair dealing in connection with a long term licensing agreement involving Eventim’s world renowned ticketing system. The claims were litigated before a single arbitrator from the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris.
Dan Rather v CBS Corporation, et al. – Obtained a complete dismissal for CBS Corporation in a $70 million breach of contract, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty suit filed by its former anchorman and correspondent Dan Rather stemming from his departure from the network in 2006.
In re Vivendi Universal, S.A. Securities Litigation – Co-lead trial counsel representing Vivendi, S.A. in the largest shareholder class action ever to go to trial, in which the plaintiffs alleged that Vivendi violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting or concealing material information about its financial condition.
In re Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litigation – Lead counsel for ExxonMobil in this litigation for which Weil handled a consolidated multidistrict federal class action, 13 state class actions, and two opt-out cases brought by major purchasers of EPDM, alleging that ExxonMobil and co-defendants unlawfully conspired to fix prices in the market for EPDM, which, historically, has exhibited the greatest growth rate among major types of rubber since it was first manufactured in the 1960s. Unlike other defendants in similar actions – who paid in total over $80 million in settlements – ExxonMobil paid nothing in damages or settlement in any of the 16 separate EPDM suits that Weil handled.
Siegel et al. v. Shell Oil Company, et al. – Successfully defeated certification of a national class on behalf of Exxon Mobil Corporation and co-defendants BP, Citgo Petroleum Corp., Marathon Oil Corp., and Shell Oil Company in a litigation alleging conspiracy among major integrated oil companies to restrict the supply of gasoline and thus increase gas prices. The plaintiff had asked for over $1 billion in damages.
Applied Medical v. Johnson & Johnson Co. – Lead counsel for J&J in a successful defense of a $54 million antitrust claim brought by a smaller competitor. The suit involved allegations of monopolization via the so-called “bundling” of discounts across a variety of different medical and surgical product markets. The jury of nine, sitting in federal court in Southern California listened to seven weeks of complex medical and economic testimony before it rejected plaintiff’s claims finding for J&J on all counts.
In re Managed Care Multidistrict Litigation – Lead counsel for UnitedHealth Group in defense of multi-billion dollar RICO and related conspiracy claims brought by a nationwide class of 700,000 doctors. All but one of the other 10 defendants settled out for more than a billion dollars. After three separate hearings, the federal court in Miami granted summary judgment, finding insufficient evidence of either conspiracy or fraud.
In the Matter of Madison Square Garden, L.P. v. New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Jets Development, LLC – Lead counsel in defense of the MTA in a lawsuit brought by MSG and several community groups seeking to overturn the MTA’s Board’s decision to proceed with negotiations with the New York Jets football team to allow the Jets to build a new football stadium over the Long Island Rail Road railyards on Manhattan’s West Side.
Colgate-Palmolive Co. v. Procter & Gamble Co. – Lead counsel in successful defense of an $80 million claim brought against Procter & Gamble by competitor Colgate-Palmolive in federal court in the Southern District of New York. The suit stemmed from Colgate’s allegations that P&G’s advertising for its highly successful at-home tooth-whitening products, Crest Whitestrips and Crest Night Effects, were false under the federal Lanham Act. Following a three-week trial, the jury wholly rejected Colgate’s claims and awarded no damages, resulting in a complete victory for P&G.
Modi Enterprises v. ESPN – Lead counsel in successful defense of a $231 million claim brought against various ESPN entities arising out of the launch of the ESPN channel in India. After a two-week trial in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York, the jury rendered a complete defense verdict for ESPN in the case in which MEN asserted claims for breach of contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, unfair competition and breach of fiduciary duty. ESPN also won $1.8 million on its counterclaim, based on MEN’s failure to make payments during the last four months of the parties’ contract. (The Lawyer, a UK legal publication, has cited this case as one of New York’s biggest cases in 2004.)
Exxon Mobil v. SABIC – Co-lead counsel for Exxon Mobil in this breach-of-contract suit against Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. Exxon claimed that SABIC had overcharged Exxon in two joint venture agreements concerning the technology responsible for petrochemical products used in a variety of plastics products sold worldwide. After Mr. Quinn’s careful jury selection due to the international nature of the case, the trial was complicated by the fact that the two contracts in question were both governed by unique Saudi law principles, and therefore Saudi law would be applied to the case. Mr. Quinn won every single count against SABIC, and the jury awarded Exxon with $416.8 million in compensatory damages. This is one of the largest verdicts in the United States in 2003 and the largest verdict in a commercial case in the history of Delaware. Every challenge that SABIC has exercised through post-trial motions has been defeated.
Furnas SA v. Westinghouse – Mr. Quinn handled this international arbitration brought by a Brazilian utility asserting a multi-billion dollar claim against our client Westinghouse before a panel of three arbitrators in the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Paris. After extensive evidentiary hearings and voluminous submissions by both sides over several years, the panel dismissed all claims against Westinghouse and instead awarded Westinghouse millions of dollars in costs and expenses related to the arbitration.
McNeil v. NFL – Lead counsel for the NFL players in this historic dispute concerning the players’ challenge to the antitrust player restrictions in the National Football League. Mr. Quinn guaranteed that a fair jury was chosen for his client after he cited a psychologist expert in sports fans who had concluded that avid sports fans were unable to be convinced that athletes had the right to sue for free agency or higher salaries. Mr. Quinn was just as resourceful during pretrial strategy as he was during jury selection. Due to the dismissal of a previous antitrust suit, Mr. Quinn had the players’ association disband, in order to thwart the defendants’ accusations that the players already had a union for a labor solution. After lengthy cross-examination of witnesses and a three-month jury trial, Mr. Quinn persuaded the jury to grant his eight players millions in damages which led to a $200 million damage settlement to the players in the NFL and true free agency for NFL players for the first time in the history of the NFL.
Buffalo Broadcasting v. American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers – As Class Counsel for Buffalo Broadcasting and 600 other television stations nationwide in this antitrust class-action concerning blanket licensing, Mr. Quinn led a three-month bench trial after which the Court held that so-called “blanket” licensing of music performing rights was an impermissible restraint on trade. While the case was later reversed on other grounds, this landmark ruling led to a complete reconstruction of music licensing rights in television and radio industries across the United States.
Houston Light & Power v. Westinghouse – Mr. Quinn represented Westinghouse in this six-month trial involving yet another multi-billion dollar claim. This time a group of utilities sued for breach of contract and fraud involving corroding steam generating equipment supplied to the largest nuclear power plant in the United States. More than a dozen lawsuits and arbitration of this kind were filed against Westinghouse in the United States and Europe, and Mr. Quinn successfully resolved every one of them.
North American Soccer League v. NFL – As lead counsel for the North American Soccer League and its teams in this suit against the NFL, Mr. Quinn successfully attacked an NFL regulation prohibiting NFL team owners from owning other professional sports teams. After an eight-week trial and an appeal to the Second Circuit, Mr. Quinn established the law that allows professional sports owners today to participate in the cross-ownership of major league teams.
Oscar Robertson, et al v. NBA – This antitrust class action was filed by 14 NBA players union against team owners in search of free agency in professional basketball. After completing 200 depositions in five cities over the course of six months, the players and owners settled, and Mr. Quinn won in the biggest case in basketball history, establishing that basketball players were free agents. In the early 1980s, Mr. Quinn won again, this time with a new collective bargaining agreement guaranteeing players 53 percent of gross revenues in exchange for a league-wide salary cap.

Character development[edit]
Background[edit]
Quinn Alexandra James was raised by Jimmy and Lydia James into a big family; including her sisters Taylor, Vivian (mentioned but never seen), Haley and three brothers. Quinn is a couple of years older than Haley, though she is younger than Vivian and Taylor. After school, Quinn became a photographer and married David Fletcher. They lived in an apartment before David bought a house with a dark room, as promised.
Character arc[edit]
Season 7[edit]
While Haley and Nathan were preparing for Jamie's seventh birthday, Quinn dropped in to see them. She attended Jamie's party, where she caught the attention of Nathan's sports agent Clay Evans, who thought she was hot, to which Quinn responded "I am hot." She continued to play the part of Jamie's fun aunt, playing a game of football with him and his friends, hiding the pain and lack of direction she was really feeling. She at first avoided telling Haley the truth about the breakdown of her marriage saying that David was simply off making a documentary but she later revealed that she left David because he wasn't the same person she fell in love with and she refused to spend her life with a complete stranger. David then started to contact Quinn, ringing her nonstop, forcing Haley to question why she actually left him. That night, Quinn told Haley about the day she decided she didn't want to be with David anymore. Quinn started to settle into life in Tree Hill and returned to working when Brooke Davis recruited her to photograph Alex Dupre in a Clothes Over Bro's photo shoot. During the shoot, Quinn showed her creative talent and befriended both Brooke and Millicent Huxtable but they were disrupted when Haley arrived having learned of the accusations against Nathan. After the shoot and trying to console Haley while at TRIC, Quinn ran into Clay and they talked until Clay left with Alex, prompting Quinn to ask if he is 'that guy'. Quinn continued to avoid her husband's call but was stunned when David arrived at TRIC, saying she had to talk to him eventually.
David then asked Quinn to come home, but she said she needed more time to think about it. Quinn met with David later and asked him for a divorce, saying that they couldn't save their marriage. At the fashion show, David arrived drunk and tried to persuade Quinn to talk to her, but Clay intervened and punched him. Quinn then talked to David again, and asked him to leave Tree Hill and to let go of her. Leaving David, she saw Clay and got into his car asking to go back to his place.
After going back to Clay's house, the two didn't sleep together and instead spent the night talking. The morning after, Clay and Quinn had breakfast together and continued to bond. When Quinn returned to the Scott house, David showed up wanting to know if Quinn went home with Clay the night before. When Quinn said that she did David told her that she had found a way to make him give up hope on them. He then said goodbye to her and left Tree Hill. With his scandal growing, Nathan told Clay not to see Quinn, however Clay found himself allowing Quinn to stay at his when the drama at the Scott house was too much.
In need of emotional support, Quinn turned to Clay but he decided to respect Nathan's request to leave Quinn alone. David returned all of Quinn's belongings, but he threw them all over Clay's driveway, forcing Quinn to go to his house to gather all her things. While going through her belongings, Quinn reminisced about her time with David. Ultimately deciding she wanted to move on, she went to see Clay, who she was unaware was dealing with the death of his late wife Sara. However, when Clay answered the door, he told her to go home to David because he didn't want to lose Sara.
Trying to move past Clay, Quinn had a girls' night in with Haley and Brooke and they called over Quinn's psychic Zelda to do readings for them. During her reading, Zelda told Quinn that a man in her life suffered a great loss and was struggling. After being told that it wasn't David, Quinn realized that Clay needed her and Zelda was referring to him. She went to his house, but he turned her away once again. However, realizing that he needed to let Quinn into his life, he ran to her car in the rain and stopped her - telling her about Sara. They then spent the night together on the beach talking about Sara and Quinn realized that Clay was finally letting her in. Quinn and Clay's relationship went from strong to stronger on the same day. On the night of Haley's concert, Quinn and Clay returned to the beach and after both admitting that they were scared and were tired of being afraid, they kissed.
When the Charlotte Bobcats signed another player instead of Nathan gets furious at Clay for both not getting him a new contract and for seeing Quinn, Nathan fired him. Quinn tried to support Clay but found there was nothing she could do. Returning to Nathan and Haley's house, Quinn didn't face a warm reception from Haley who told Quinn not to talk to her given that she played a huge part in Nathan losing his job. She then started to pack her bags and leave their house causing another argument between her and Haley, who said that Clay got careless by spending time with Quinn. Stating that Clay worked extremely hard for Nathan and that he received nothing in return, she was glad Clay wasn't in Nathan's life anymore.
Quinn and Haley put their differences on hold because Haley needed her sister's help. Needing to help Clay, Quinn went to his office and found his assistant - asking her to help Clay. Clay's assistant told Quinn that Joe Turner's mother was sick and, while the meaningfulness of this was lost on Quinn, when she told Clay, he took Quinn to Joe's house to talk to him, in a bid to persuade Joe to let Clay negotiate a deal with the Bobcats to allow Joe to play for them - a plan which could also get Nathan back on the team. With Joe on board after Clay visited him, he then had to persuade the Bobcats to sign a deal in which Joe and Nathan could be signed to the team and Derek McDaniel traded off the team to another. However, Quinn and Clay struggled to gain access to the Bobcats' arena, until Clay came up with a plan for Quinn to pose as a cheerleader. His plan faced an unexpected twist when Quinn's turn to perform came before Clay finished his discussions. Quinn initially copied another cheerleader but when she left the stage, Quinn was forced to improvise and decided to have fun with the routine while Clay watched from the sidelines. Clay got the deal and they broke the good news to an ecstatic Nathan and Haley, but Clay told Nathan that if he was to sign with him again he would have to know that he planned on falling completely in love with Quinn. Quinn and Clay then met at the beach and their relationship was made permanent when Quinn walked into the sea, facing her fear, to be with him
One of Clay's prospective clients, Katie Ryan bears an uncanny resemblance to Sara, Clay's dead wife. She soon begins to stalk Clay and even dyes her hair blonde to perfect her resemblance to Sara. However, when she realizes that Clay will never leave Quinn, Katie breaks into the beach house and shoots both Quinn and Clay before leaving them for dead.
Season 8[edit]
Having been shot by Katie Ryan, Haley finds Clay and Quinn in their beach house. She then rushes the two to the hospital. While in a coma, Clay and Quinn meet in a dream and remember what happened to them after spending the day on the beach. Once they discover they've been shot they watch their body and loved ones in the hospital. They realize that it is really distressing for them. Quinn gets well enough to come out of her coma but first refuses to leave Clay. Quinn stays by Clay's side and is desperate for him to wake up. Clay is later on a respirator until in his dream he met Will Bennett, who later dies and donated his organs to helping others and gives Clay his kidney, Clay's best friend Nathan had previously decided to donate his but wasn't a match.
Clay soon recovers, and leaves the hospital with Quinn. Once they return to their home together Quinn has trouble sleeping and has nightmares. In one of them she sees Katie as zombie as well as Nathan, Haley and Jamie. Clay eventually realizes something is wrong when he finds a gun in her drawer on Halloween night, right after she tells him she thinks she saw Katie on the monitor. Therefore, Clay asks her to go to South Africa for her work.
After not appearing in two episodes Quinn returns on Thanksgiving Day and seems quite happy but tired. When she opens her envelope containing her pictures she finds some of Katie, thus making it well known to her that she is back. After this Quinn goes to visits Dan for information on what she should do with Katie. Dan tries to convince her not to kill Katie and to open her eyes. After driving back home she stops by the river and throws her gun into the river. In the thunderstorm, Katie attacks Quinn at her home and Quinn struggles to stay alive. First she hides under her bed but Katie finds her and pulls her out. The two of them start a hide and seek game and when Quinn has the chance to escape, Katie tells her that she will find her. Quinn upon hearing this attacks Katie and throws her into the pool. Quinn pretends to have drowned so when Katie gets out and goes into the house Quinn grabs Katie's gun that was on the bed in the beach house and in the end she manages to shoot Katie but does not kill her. After the ordeal Quinn goes to a party along with Alex, Brooke, Haley and Millie and wakes up drunk the next day.
Season 9[edit]
At the start of season 9, Quinn is struggling with Clay as he has been sleepwalking and waking up in random places. Quinn tries to get Clay to seek help, however this causes Clay to act out even more and starts to argue with Quinn. Clay decides that it would be best if he was to go to a facility that would help him recover. Quinn struggles without Clay, however Clay is making progress and has started a friendship with a young boy, Logan. It is discovered that Clay was sleepwalking because he was blocking out a part of his life with Sara. Clay remembers that Logan is his son. Quinn tries to help Clay to tell Logan that he is his father. Quinn comforts Clay when Logan rejects Clay, however Logan reconsiders and wants Clay and Quinn to be a part of his life. Quinn and Clay prepare for Logan's first sleepover at the beach house. It is at this time that Clay proposes to Quinn. She says yes. In the final episode, Quinn and Clay make their way to the registry office to adopt Logan. Here Logan calls Quinn, 'mom' so this prompts Quinn to suggest that her and Clay get married there and then. They get married and adopt Logan.

Character development[edit]
Background[edit]
Quinn Alexandra James was raised by Jimmy and Lydia James into a big family; including her sisters Taylor, Vivian (mentioned but never seen), Haley and three brothers. Quinn is a couple of years older than Haley, though she is younger than Vivian and Taylor. After school, Quinn became a photographer and married David Fletcher. They lived in an apartment before David bought a house with a dark room, as promised.
Character arc[edit]
Season 7[edit]
While Haley and Nathan were preparing for Jamie's seventh birthday, Quinn dropped in to see them. She attended Jamie's party, where she caught the attention of Nathan's sports agent Clay Evans, who thought she was hot, to which Quinn responded "I am hot." She continued to play the part of Jamie's fun aunt, playing a game of football with him and his friends, hiding the pain and lack of direction she was really feeling. She at first avoided telling Haley the truth about the breakdown of her marriage saying that David was simply off making a documentary but she later revealed that she left David because he wasn't the same person she fell in love with and she refused to spend her life with a complete stranger. David then started to contact Quinn, ringing her nonstop, forcing Haley to question why she actually left him. That night, Quinn told Haley about the day she decided she didn't want to be with David anymore. Quinn started to settle into life in Tree Hill and returned to working when Brooke Davis recruited her to photograph Alex Dupre in a Clothes Over Bro's photo shoot. During the shoot, Quinn showed her creative talent and befriended both Brooke and Millicent Huxtable but they were disrupted when Haley arrived having learned of the accusations against Nathan. After the shoot and trying to console Haley while at TRIC, Quinn ran into Clay and they talked until Clay left with Alex, prompting Quinn to ask if he is 'that guy'. Quinn continued to avoid her husband's call but was stunned when David arrived at TRIC, saying she had to talk to him eventually.
David then asked Quinn to come home, but she said she needed more time to think about it. Quinn met with David later and asked him for a divorce, saying that they couldn't save their marriage. At the fashion show, David arrived drunk and tried to persuade Quinn to talk to her, but Clay intervened and punched him. Quinn then talked to David again, and asked him to leave Tree Hill and to let go of her. Leaving David, she saw Clay and got into his car asking to go back to his place.
After going back to Clay's house, the two didn't sleep together and instead spent the night talking. The morning after, Clay and Quinn had breakfast together and continued to bond. When Quinn returned to the Scott house, David showed up wanting to know if Quinn went home with Clay the night before. When Quinn said that she did David told her that she had found a way to make him give up hope on them. He then said goodbye to her and left Tree Hill. With his scandal growing, Nathan told Clay not to see Quinn, however Clay found himself allowing Quinn to stay at his when the drama at the Scott house was too much.
In need of emotional support, Quinn turned to Clay but he decided to respect Nathan's request to leave Quinn alone. David returned all of Quinn's belongings, but he threw them all over Clay's driveway, forcing Quinn to go to his house to gather all her things. While going through her belongings, Quinn reminisced about her time with David. Ultimately deciding she wanted to move on, she went to see Clay, who she was unaware was dealing with the death of his late wife Sara. However, when Clay answered the door, he told her to go home to David because he didn't want to lose Sara.
Trying to move past Clay, Quinn had a girls' night in with Haley and Brooke and they called over Quinn's psychic Zelda to do readings for them. During her reading, Zelda told Quinn that a man in her life suffered a great loss and was struggling. After being told that it wasn't David, Quinn realized that Clay needed her and Zelda was referring to him. She went to his house, but he turned her away once again. However, realizing that he needed to let Quinn into his life, he ran to her car in the rain and stopped her - telling her about Sara. They then spent the night together on the beach talking about Sara and Quinn realized that Clay was finally letting her in. Quinn and Clay's relationship went from strong to stronger on the same day. On the night of Haley's concert, Quinn and Clay returned to the beach and after both admitting that they were scared and were tired of being afraid, they kissed.
When the Charlotte Bobcats signed another player instead of Nathan gets furious at Clay for both not getting him a new contract and for seeing Quinn, Nathan fired him. Quinn tried to support Clay but found there was nothing she could do. Returning to Nathan and Haley's house, Quinn didn't face a warm reception from Haley who told Quinn not to talk to her given that she played a huge part in Nathan losing his job. She then started to pack her bags and leave their house causing another argument between her and Haley, who said that Clay got careless by spending time with Quinn. Stating that Clay worked extremely hard for Nathan and that he received nothing in return, she was glad Clay wasn't in Nathan's life anymore.
Quinn and Haley put their differences on hold because Haley needed her sister's help. Needing to help Clay, Quinn went to his office and found his assistant - asking her to help Clay. Clay's assistant told Quinn that Joe Turner's mother was sick and, while the meaningfulness of this was lost on Quinn, when she told Clay, he took Quinn to Joe's house to talk to him, in a bid to persuade Joe to let Clay negotiate a deal with the Bobcats to allow Joe to play for them - a plan which could also get Nathan back on the team. With Joe on board after Clay visited him, he then had to persuade the Bobcats to sign a deal in which Joe and Nathan could be signed to the team and Derek McDaniel traded off the team to another. However, Quinn and Clay struggled to gain access to the Bobcats' arena, until Clay came up with a plan for Quinn to pose as a cheerleader. His plan faced an unexpected twist when Quinn's turn to perform came before Clay finished his discussions. Quinn initially copied another cheerleader but when she left the stage, Quinn was forced to improvise and decided to have fun with the routine while Clay watched from the sidelines. Clay got the deal and they broke the good news to an ecstatic Nathan and Haley, but Clay told Nathan that if he was to sign with him again he would have to know that he planned on falling completely in love with Quinn. Quinn and Clay then met at the beach and their relationship was made permanent when Quinn walked into the sea, facing her fear, to be with him
One of Clay's prospective clients, Katie Ryan bears an uncanny resemblance to Sara, Clay's dead wife. She soon begins to stalk Clay and even dyes her hair blonde to perfect her resemblance to Sara. However, when she realizes that Clay will never leave Quinn, Katie breaks into the beach house and shoots both Quinn and Clay before leaving them for dead.
Season 8[edit]
Having been shot by Katie Ryan, Haley finds Clay and Quinn in their beach house. She then rushes the two to the hospital. While in a coma, Clay and Quinn meet in a dream and remember what happened to them after spending the day on the beach. Once they discover they've been shot they watch their body and loved ones in the hospital. They realize that it is really distressing for them. Quinn gets well enough to come out of her coma but first refuses to leave Clay. Quinn stays by Clay's side and is desperate for him to wake up. Clay is later on a respirator until in his dream he met Will Bennett, who later dies and donated his organs to helping others and gives Clay his kidney, Clay's best friend Nathan had previously decided to donate his but wasn't a match.
Clay soon recovers, and leaves the hospital with Quinn. Once they return to their home together Quinn has trouble sleeping and has nightmares. In one of them she sees Katie as zombie as well as Nathan, Haley and Jamie. Clay eventually realizes something is wrong when he finds a gun in her drawer on Halloween night, right after she tells him she thinks she saw Katie on the monitor. Therefore, Clay asks her to go to South Africa for her work.
After not appearing in two episodes Quinn returns on Thanksgiving Day and seems quite happy but tired. When she opens her envelope containing her pictures she finds some of Katie, thus making it well known to her that she is back. After this Quinn goes to visits Dan for information on what she should do with Katie. Dan tries to convince her not to kill Katie and to open her eyes. After driving back home she stops by the river and throws her gun into the river. In the thunderstorm, Katie attacks Quinn at her home and Quinn struggles to stay alive. First she hides under her bed but Katie finds her and pulls her out. The two of them start a hide and seek game and when Quinn has the chance to escape, Katie tells her that she will find her. Quinn upon hearing this attacks Katie and throws her into the pool. Quinn pretends to have drowned so when Katie gets out and goes into the house Quinn grabs Katie's gun that was on the bed in the beach house and in the end she manages to shoot Katie but does not kill her. After the ordeal Quinn goes to a party along with Alex, Brooke, Haley and Millie and wakes up drunk the next day.
Season 9[edit]
At the start of season 9, Quinn is struggling with Clay as he has been sleepwalking and waking up in random places. Quinn tries to get Clay to seek help, however this causes Clay to act out even more and starts to argue with Quinn. Clay decides that it would be best if he was to go to a facility that would help him recover. Quinn struggles without Clay, however Clay is making progress and has started a friendship with a young boy, Logan. It is discovered that Clay was sleepwalking because he was blocking out a part of his life with Sara. Clay remembers that Logan is his son. Quinn tries to help Clay to tell Logan that he is his father. Quinn comforts Clay when Logan rejects Clay, however Logan reconsiders and wants Clay and Quinn to be a part of his life. Quinn and Clay prepare for Logan's first sleepover at the beach house. It is at this time that Clay proposes to Quinn. She says yes. In the final episode, Quinn and Clay make their way to the registry office to adopt Logan. Here Logan calls Quinn, 'mom' so this prompts Quinn to suggest that her and Clay get married there and then. They get married and adopt Logan.
