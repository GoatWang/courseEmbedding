	Forward-looking Statements




	This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These
	statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some
	cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may",
	"will", "should", "expects", "plans", "anticipates", "believes", "estimates",
	"predicts", "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other
	comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known
	and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our
	industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be
	materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or
	achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.


	Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
	forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
	levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by
	applicable laws, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not
	intend to update any of the forward-looking statements so as to conform these
	statements to actual results.


	As used in this annual report, the terms "we", "us", "our",
	the Company, and "FlitWays" mean FlitWays Technology Inc., unless otherwise
	indicated.


	All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise
	indicated.



	Corporate Background



	FlitWays Technology Inc. was founded in 2013, with a mission to
	provide both corporate enterprises and their employees and global travel
	resellers and their customers with a complete offering of fully integrated
	ground transportation solutions for any budget or need. We have created a
	sophisticated software platform to give customers enterprise suite and app-based
	booking, billing, expense management and real-time monitoring for a simple to
	use ground transportation offering. We combined that with our proprietary global
	network of private car, limousine, taxi and ride sharing service providers. This
	allows our clients to have a solution that mimics the simplicity of workflow for
	airline and hotel travel, removing the manual, complex and time consuming nature
	of traditional ground transportation. Our offering not only helps our customers,
	but provides car service owners and drivers better utilization of their equity.
	We give travelers an array of classes of cars, pick-up options and payment
	options, all fully integrated to corporate expense and travel management
	systems. FlitWays objective is to take an antiquated market and bring it into
	line with the advanced and seamless methodology of the other key components of
	the travel experience.




	Merger Transaction




	      
	     On October 14, 2016 (Closing Date), Flitways
	completed a reverse recapitalization of Cataca Resources, Inc. (Cataca), a
	Nevada corporation. At the time of the reverse recapitalization, Cataca was
	considered a shell corporation with no revenues or significant assets. In
	connection with the merger transaction, Cataca issued 20,000,000 shares of its
	common stock in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
	Flitways.






	            For
	financial reporting purposes, Flitways has been treated as the acquirer in the
	reverse recapitalization completed on the Closing Date. Accordingly, the assets
	and liabilities of Flitways are reported at their historical cost and the assets
	and liabilities of Cataca were recorded at their historical cost basis. The
	consolidated financial statements reported herein have been retroactively
	restated for all periods presented to report the historical financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows of Flitways. The 30,000,000 shares of
	common stock retained by the Cataca shareholders were reported as issued on the
	Closing Date.



	Our Business



	FlitWays offers fee-for-service pre-booking of ground transportation  We immediately confirm car services at the time of travel planning on a similar basis to flight and hotel arrangements.  The current market for ground travel is booked, billed and expensed outside the integrated corporate platforms used for the other two key legs of travel costs.  Corporate ground travel in the U.S. is a multi-billion dollar  market and typically requires separate booking via phone (or in some cases online), but has necessitated manual expense review without automatic adherence to  corporate standards and restrictions.  This subsequently creates a need for time-consuming and costly administrative resources to match ground transportation with otherwise system-integrated air and lodging   reporting.  FlitWays’ proprietary software, services, supply chain and customer relationship management solution can provide clients with cost savings, workflow improvements, superior traveler experiences and corporate compliant permitted uses..


	We are differentiated from taxi and ride sharing services in many ways.  Our software, back-end solution and unique network of providers has been designed to offer a suite of enterprise level technology, accounting, payment, reporting and management tools that are not available in the market.  FlitWays has spent more than four years developing these interfaces for clients to completely integrate travel and expense management tools with ground transportation. We consider FlitWays a one-stop shop for all enterprise  ground transportation needs.  As we expand our fully vetted and reviewed supply of car services and drivers both in the U.S. and globally, we can support our client relationships both because of the stability and flexibility of our software platform and the financial and operating leverage we provide from our simple app-based booking and planning service. With over 18,000 vehicles to choose from and with service in over 170 cities, the possibilities are endless and our customers can create a seamless travel experience.


	Our contact address is 400 Corporate Pointe, Suite 300, Culver
	City, California, 90230. Our telephone number is 1-855-710-0915. Our website is
	www.flitways.com.


	Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Annual
	Report to dollars or $ refer to US dollars.



	Corporate Solutions/Competitive Advantage



	FlitWays intends to fill a void in the scheduling and management of global ground transportation services.  We built our client interface with corporate travel needs in mind.  Businesses that allow employees to use consumer facing services like Uber, Lyft and independent taxi and limousine companies are potentially sacrificing the per user cost and administrative savings that FlitWays provides.


	Today, our corporate clientele includes major brands like Carlson Wagonlit, Amazon, Pokemon, PayPal and CarTrawler.



	Travel Management & Travel Agencies



	FlitWays empowers travel management companies and agencies to combine their bookings with a contemporaneous ground transportation offering on the same ticket for their clients.  Just as in our enterprise service, we provide pre-arranged rides scheduled while flight or lodging confirmations are made.  We have developed an application-based handoff to allow these travel resellers to electronically book directly on our network.  This is an attractive market for FlitWays as we incur no marketing expenses to add this large customer segment.  In exchange, we offer a 10% discount from our published fares to our travel reseller partners.







	Booking rides with FlitWays



	Booking rides, airport shuttles and/or executive cars with our
	website/application requires the customer to be a registered user. When booking
	with FlitWays the customer is able to select a choice of vehicle and preferred
	gratuity based on their personal preference. The estimate travel fare provided
	is built on the most resourceful travel route and on decent traffic situations.
	The ultimate fare may differ due to traffic situations, the route taken, wait
	time, parking, and return trip. Once the customer's booking has been completed
	and confirmed, the company that owns the vehicle chosen is automatically
	notified that the vehicle is booked. The notification of the booking
	confirmation is also sent to the customer via SMS and email confirmation message
	together with the details of the customers journey. Customers can view their
	past bookings in their FlitWays account, which can be easily used for business
	travel expense reports.



	Payment



	We accept corporate invoices and credit card payments for ride
	booking from our customers. Our platform allows our customers to pay securely
	and also eliminate the hassle of negotiating fare price with the ride driver.
	All payment information processed on our site is encrypted and secured with
	state-of-the-art SSL before they are transferred.



	Customer Accounts



	Currently FlitWays charges no fee for its services and records revenues on the profit margin of billed fares versus cost of fares.  Customers establish accounts prior to booking either based on invoice or credit card payments..  We require an account in order to collect basic information (i.e., name, mobile phone number and email) and to process all bookings.



	Marketing Strategy



	Most of our customers have been acquired through various
	partnerships with travel vendors, which give us the opportunity to minimize
	marketing costs and to focus on establishing new partnerships daily. In the
	future we intend to promote FlitWays using Business-to-Business marketing
	concepts to increase and expand brand awareness and general corporate exposure.



	Employees and Consultants



	As of December 31, 2016, we have 3 employees and 7 independent
	contractors.






	Item 1A. Risk Factors



	Not required.






	Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments



	None.










	Item 2. Properties



	We have maintained executive offices at 400 Corporate Pointe,
	Suite 300, Culver City, California 90230. The office and general expenses
	associated with leasing our office space is approximately $1,700 per month. We
	believe that our office space is adequate for our current needs, but growth
	potential may require a facility due to anticipated addition of personnel. We do
	not have any policies regarding investments in real estate, securities or other
	forms of property. We do not own any real property.






	Item 3. Legal Proceedings



	We know of no material pending or active legal proceedings to
	which we are a party or concerning any of our properties. We are not aware of
	any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority against us.






	Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures



	Not applicable.











	PART II






	Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related
	Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.





	Market Information




	There is a limited public market for our common shares. Our
	common shares are quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets under the symbol FTWS. Trading
	in stocks quoted on the OTC Pink Sheets is often thin and is characterized by
	wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to
	a companys operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there
	will be a market in the future for our common stock.


	OTC Pink Sheets securities are not listed or traded on the
	floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Pink
	Sheets securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer
	network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Pink Sheets issuers are traditionally
	smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements
	of a regional or national stock exchange.


	As of March 9, 2017 no shares of our common stock have traded.




	Number of Holders




	As of March 9, 2017, we had approximately 38 shareholders of
	record of our common stock.




	Dividend Policy




	We have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock
	since our inception and do not anticipate paying such dividends in the
	foreseeable future. We plan to retain any future earnings for use in our
	business. Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our
	earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors
	deems relevant.

	Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial
	Condition and Results of Operation





	Safe Harbor




	This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking
	statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to
	future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can
	identify forward-looking statements by terminology including, "could" "may",
	"will", "should", "expect", "plan", "anticipate", "believe", "estimate",
	"predict", "potential" and the negative of these terms or other comparable
	terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may
	differ materially.


	While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions
	upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current
	judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost
	always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections,
	assumptions or other future performance suggested in this Annual Report.

	net for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by 28.8% to $434,000 as
	compared to $337,000 for 2015. The increase in sales, net is contributable to an
	overall increase in business. The Company continues to expand its business.


	            Gross
	profit for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased to 16% as compared to 20%
	for 2015. Our cost of sales is comprised of (i) fees paid to the contract
	drivers, (ii) fees paid for the credit card processing services and (iii) cost
	of maintaining our call centers. The increase in gross profit is contributable
	to our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our contract drivers.


	            Core
	technology and development expenses increased by 145.8% to $59,000 as compared
	to $24,000 for 2015. The increase in core technology and development expenses is
	attributable to our continued expansion of the services we provide to our
	customer. As we identify new services, we are required to update our core
	technology to handle the new services.


	            Officer
	salary increased by 9.7% to $79,000 as compared to $72,000 for 2015. The
	increase in officer salary is attributable to a contractual annual salary
	increase for the year ended December 31, 2016.


	            General and administrative expenses increased by 2,824% to $2,515,000 as compared to $86,000 for 2015. The increase in our general and administrative expense is attributable to (i) increase in employee related cost of approximately $41,000, (ii) consulting expenses related to corporate structure of approximately $2,330,000, which includes approximately $1,845,000 for fair value of shares issued to consultants and (iii) the remaining increase of approximately $144,000 is attributable to the additional cost we incurred for accounting, auditing, consulting and legal services related to our status of being public company filing with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

	Sales, net for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by
	403% to $337,000 as compared to $67,000 for 2014. The increase in sales, net is
	contributable to an overall increase in business as the Company continues to
	expand.


	            Gross
	profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to 20% as compared to 4%
	for 2014. The increase in gross profit margin is attributable to a combination
	of economies of scale with the increased activity during the year ended December
	31, 2015 as well as the ability of management to minimize overall costs in order
	to increase the profit margins.


	            Core
	technology and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015
	increased by 200% to $24,000 as compared to $8,000 for 2014. The increase in
	core technology and development expenses is attributable to our continued
	expansion of the services we provide to our customer. As we identify new
	services, we are required to update our core technology to handle the new
	services.


	            General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by 177% to $86,000 as compared to $31,000 for 2014. The increase in general and administrative is attributable to expanse of resources as the Company continues to expand its business.









	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	            During
	the year ended December 31, 2016, our primary source of liquidity was from our
	sales of the Companys common stock as compared to prior years where our primary
	source of liquidity was from our cash balances on hand from December 31, 2015.
	The following summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31,:

	2015

	Cash (used in) provided by financing
	activities

	$


	 69,000


	 


	$


	 (7,000


	)





	            As
	a result of our growth stage, the Company net sales have not reach a level to
	sustain cash flow to meet our current obligations and operations expenditures,
	as result the Company sold shares of the Companys common stock to raise capital
	to meet our operating expenditures.


	            As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total assets were $87,000 and $16,000, respectively, and our total liabilities were $755,000 and $245,000, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2105, we had working capital deficits of approximately of $668,000 and $179,000, respectively.


	            We
	reported net losses of $2,589,000 and $120,000 for the years ended December 31,
	2016 and 2015, respectively.


	            During
	the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we raised a total of $305,000 and $0
	in connection with the issuances of shares of our common stock for gross
	proceeds of $305,000.




	Cash Requirements




	            Our
	ability to fund our growth and meet our obligations on a timely basis is
	dependent on our ability to match our available financial resources to our
	growth strategy, which includes acquisitions for cash or a combination of cash
	and debt. The decisions we make with regard to acquisitions drive the level of
	capital required and the level of our financial obligations.


	            If
	we are unable to generate cash flow from operations and successfully raise
	sufficient additional capital through future debt and equity financings or
	strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners, we would likely
	have to reduce the size and scope of our operations.


	            We
	have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our Company
	is dependent upon our Company attaining and maintaining profitable operations
	and raising additional capital as needed. In this regard, we have raised
	additional capital through equity offerings and loan transactions, and, in the
	short term, will seek to raise additional capital in such manners to fund our
	operations. Our officers and shareholders have not made any written or oral
	agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no assurance that we
	will be able to continue to raise capital on terms and conditions that are
	acceptable to us.








	Inflation




	            In
	the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect
	on our operations in the immediate future. Management will continue to monitor
	inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business
	and operations.




	Contractual Payment Obligations




	            We
	have no obligations under non-cancelable operating lease, as
	of December 31, 2016. The Company rents its office space on month-by-month
	basis. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a line of credit balance of $86,000 due and payable on or before December 31,2017




	Off Balance Sheet Arrangements




	            Under
	SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements
	that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
	financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenue or
	expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources that are material to investors. As of December 31, 2016, we have no
	off-balance sheet arrangements.




	Going Concern




	            The
	Companys independent registered public auditors reports accompanying our
	December 31, 2016 and 2015 audited financial statements contains an explanatory
	paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going
	concern. The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
	will continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
	dependent on raising additional capital to fund our operations and ultimately on
	generating future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that we will
	be able to raise sufficient additional capital or eventually have positive cash
	flow from operations to address all of our cash flow needs. If we are not able
	to find alternative sources of cash or generate positive cash flow from
	operations, our business and shareholders will be materially and adversely
	affected.




	Critical Accounting Policies




	            The
	discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is
	based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
	conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to
	the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and
	require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be
	materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or
	conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an
	inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, management uses
	their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the
	determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical
	operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms
	of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information
	provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources,
	as appropriate. For information regarding the Companys critical accounting
	policies as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the
	consolidated financial statements.




	Concentration of Credit Risk




	            Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk
	consist of cash and accounts receivable. Under Section 343 of the Dodd-Frank
	Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, for the two-year period of
	January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, cash balances in noninterest-bearing
	transaction accounts at all FDIC-insured depository institutions are provided
	temporary unlimited deposit insurance coverage. As of December 31, 2016, cash
	balances in interest-bearing accounts were approximately $0.




	Trends, Events, and Uncertainties




	            Development
	of new technologies or product solutions is, by its nature, unpredictable.
	Although we will undertake development efforts with commercially reasonable
	diligence, there can be no assurance that we will have adequate capital to develop our technology or products to the
	extent needed to create future sales to sustain our operations.






	            No
	assurance can be provided that our technology or products will be adopted, that
	we will ever earn revenue sufficient to support our operations, or that we will
	ever be profitable. Furthermore, since we have no committed source of financing,
	we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise money as and when we
	need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need
	them, we may be required to severely curtail, or even to cease, our operations.


	            Other
	than as discussed above and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are
	not aware of any trends, events, or uncertainties that are likely to have a
	material effect on our financial condition.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of FlitWays Technology Inc.


	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of FlitWays Technology, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of FlitWays Technology Inc. as of December 31, 2016, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has continued to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations during the year ended December 31, 2016 and continues to have negative working capital at December 31, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



	To the Stockholders of

	FlitWays Technology Inc.

	Los Angeles, California


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of FlitWays Technology Inc. as of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.


	Accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of FlitWays Technology Inc. as of December 31, 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.


	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has recurring losses from operations since inception and has limited working capital. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	FLITWAYS TECHNOLOGY INC.





	Notes to Consolidated
	Financial Statements



	For the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and 1014





	Note 1 - Nature of the Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies





	Company 



	            Flitways
	Technology Inc., formerly known as Cataca Resources, Inc. (the Company), was
	incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on December 11, 2012
	and established a fiscal year end of December 31. The Company was initially
	engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural resource
	properties. On September 7, 2016, the Company abandoned its mineral claim and
	entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with
	Flitways Technology Inc. (Flitways). The Company refocused its efforts and is
	now involved in the on demand transportation business providing businesses and
	private travelers access to book and schedule ground transportation online or
	by mobile device. The Company gives travelers access to customizable travel
	rides through a network of ground travel providers. It incorporates ride booking
	into the travel industry by making travel ride booking available at various
	travel points of sale to allow travelers to book rides that fit their lifestyle
	online and on its mobile application. Effective November 9, 2016, the Company
	changed its name from Cataca Resources, Inc. to Flitways Technology Inc.




	Merger Transaction


	            


	            On October 14, 2016 (“Closing Date”), Flitways completed a reverse recapitalization of Cataca Resources, Inc. (“Cataca”), a Nevada corporation. At the time of the reverse recapitalization, Cataca was considered a shell corporation with no revenues or significant assets. In connection with the merger transaction, Cataca issued 20,000,000 shares of its common stock in exchange for 100%, or 10,000,000 shares, of the issued and outstanding shares of Flitways. This share exchange resulted in the shareholders of Flitways obtaining a majority voting interest in Cataca.


	            For
	financial reporting purposes, Flitways has been treated as the acquirer in the
	reverse recapitalization completed on the Closing Date. Accordingly, the assets
	and liabilities of Flitways are reported at their historical cost and the assets
	and liabilities of Cataca were recorded at their historical cost basis. The
	consolidated financial statements reported herein have been retroactively
	restated for all periods presented to report the historical financial position,
	results of operations and cash flows of Flitways. The 30,000,000 shares of
	common stock retained by the Cataca shareholders were reported as issued on the
	Closing Date.



	Basis of Presentation



	            The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has experienced recurring losses since its inception. The Company incurred a net loss of approximately $2,589,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, and had an accumulated deficit of approximately $2,843,000 as of December 31, 2016. Since inception, the Company has financed its activities principally through loans from its majority shareholder and equity financing. Management expects to incur additional losses and cash outflows in the foreseeable future in connection with development of its operating activities.


	F-7






	            These
	conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a
	going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
	prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
	United States of America, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a
	going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any
	adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
	amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from
	the outcome of this uncertainty. The consolidated financial statements do not
	include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
	continue as a going concern.


	            The
	Company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage
	companies, including dependence on key individuals, successful development,
	marketing and branding of products; uncertainty of technology development and
	generation of revenues; dependence on outside sources of financing; risks
	associated with research, development; dependence on third-party contractors for
	ride services; protection of intellectual property; and competition with larger,
	better-capitalized companies. Ultimately, the attainment of profitable
	operations is dependent on future events, including obtaining adequate financing
	to fulfil its development activities and generating a level of revenues adequate
	to support the Companys cost structure. To support the Companys financial
	performance, the Companys majority shareholder has executed a line of credit to
	provide funding to the Company of not more than $200,000.


	            There
	can be no assurance however that such financing will be available in sufficient
	amounts, when and if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. If results of
	operations for 2017 do not meet managements expectations, or additional capital
	is not available, management believes it has the ability to reduce certain
	expenditures. The precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be
	determined accurately at this time, and will depend on a number of factors,
	including the market demand for the Companys services, the quality of
	technology development efforts, management of working capital, and continuation
	of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services. The Company is
	uncertain whether its cash balances and cash flow from operations will be
	sufficient to fund its operations for the next twelve months. If the Company is
	unable to substantially increase revenues, reduce expenditures, or otherwise
	generate cash flows for operations, then the Company will need to raise
	additional funding to continue as a going concern through its major
	shareholder(s), or through other avenues.




	Reclassification 



	            Certain
	amounts presented in the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance, consolidated
	statement of operations and consolidated cash flows have been reclassified to
	correspond to the presentation in the 2016 financial statements.




	Financial Statement
	Presentation



	            The
	preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.
	generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make
	estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related
	disclosures.




	Use of
	Estimates 



	            The
	preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with GAAP
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
	amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during
	the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	F-8








	Cash and Cash
	Equivalents


	 

	            The
	Company considers all unrestricted cash, short-term deposits, and other
	investments with original maturities of no more than ninety days when acquired
	to be cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows.
	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any cash equivalents.




	Concentration of Credit
	Risk


	 

	            Financial
	instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk
	consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash
	balances at financial institutions within the United States, which are insured
	by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to limits of
	approximately $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard
	to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its
	cash bank accounts.




	Accounts
	Receivable


	 

	            Accounts
	receivable are comprised of credit card settlements and receivables from travel
	partners and are stated at cost less an allowance for estimated uncollectible
	accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts
	and the relationship with and financial status of the Companys customers.
	Account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined
	that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered. As of December
	31, 2016 and 2015, no allowance for bad debt was considered necessary.




	Property and
	Equipment


	 

	            Property
	and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and
	amortization, and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful
	lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance, repairs, and minor
	renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property and
	equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the
	respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of
	operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment
	using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of
	the lease, as appropriate. Software and Computer Equipment are depreciated over
	a period of three years.




	Commitments and
	Contingencies 



	            In
	the normal course of business, the Company is subject to loss contingencies,
	such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business, that cover a
	wide range of matters, including, among others, government investigations,
	environment liability and tax matters. An accrual for a loss contingency is
	recognized when it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability
	had been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.




	Fair Value
	Measurements


	 

	            The
	accounting standards regarding fair value of financial instruments and related
	fair value measurements define fair value, establish a three-level valuation
	hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure
	requirements for fair value measures.


	            ASC
	Topic 820 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to
	valuation used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into
	three broad levels as follows:


	            Level
	1 - inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets
	or liabilities.


	F-9






	            Level
	2 - inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active
	markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either
	directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full
	term of the financial instrument.


	            Level
	3 - inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure
	assets and liabilities at fair value.


	            

	On
	a Recurring
	Basis

	 

	            A
	financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined
	based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
	measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input
	to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make
	judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability.


	            As
	of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no financial assets and
	liabilities carried at fair value.


	            Due
	to their short-term nature, the carrying values of cash and equivalents,
	accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, approximate fair
	value. Based on borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans
	with similar terms, the carrying value of the notes payable approximates fair
	value.




	Accounting for Stock-Based
	Compensation

	 


	            Share-based
	compensation cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the
	award, and is recognized as expense over the employees service period. The
	Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
	requisite service period of the award.


	            Equity
	instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value on the
	measurement date and are subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity
	instruments vest.


	            We
	determined that the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model is the most appropriate
	method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options or warrants.
	The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of highly subjective and complex
	assumptions that determine the fair value of share-based awards, including the
	equity instruments expected term and the price volatility of the underlying
	stock.




	Segment
	Information

	 


	            Operating
	segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate
	financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief
	operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate
	resources and in assessing performance. The Companys chief operating decision
	maker is its senior management team. The Company has one operating segment that
	is dedicated to the on demand transportation business providing businesses and
	private travelers access to book and schedule ground transportation online or
	by mobile device.




	Revenue
	Recognition


	 

	            Revenues
	are generally recognized when an agreement exists and price is determinable, the
	service has been rendered, net of discounts, returns and allowance and
	collectability is reasonably assured. These conditions are typically met when
	the trip has been completed. The Company utilizes third parties as
	transportation providers for customers. The Company, acting as principal as the
	Company is the primary obligor in the arrangement with its customers, has latitude in
	establishing pricing, the Company customizes the services required to the
	particular customer needs, has discretion in selection of transportation
	providers, and assumes all credit risk in its transactions.


	F-10








	Cost of
	Sales


	 

	            Cost
	of sales includes cost of the various transportation providers and merchant fees
	related to each transaction.




	Income
	Taxes

	 


	            The
	provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach
	of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, deferred taxes represent
	the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of
	assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes
	represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in
	deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes result from differences between
	the financial and tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities and are
	adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted. A
	valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more
	likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.


	            We
	must assess the likelihood that the Companys deferred tax assets will be
	recovered from future taxable income, and to the extent the Company believes
	that recovery is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance. Management
	judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax
	assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against the net
	deferred tax assets. We recorded a full valuation allowance as of December 31,
	2016 and 2015. Based on the available evidence, the Company believes it is more
	likely than not that it will not be able to utilize its deferred tax assets in
	the future. We intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence
	exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances. We make estimates
	and judgments about its future taxable income that are based on assumptions that
	are consistent with our plans. Should the actual amounts differ from our
	estimates, the carrying value of our deferred tax assets could be materially
	impacted.


	            We
	recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that
	position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the
	technical merits of the position. The Companys policy is to recognize interest
	and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of
	operating expense. We do not believe there are any tax positions for which it is
	reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will
	significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date.
	There were no penalties or interest liabilities accrued as of fiscal year end
	December 31, 2016 or 2015, nor were any penalties or interest costs included in
	expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	            The
	years under which we conducted our evaluation coincided with the tax years
	currently still subject to examination by major federal and state tax
	jurisdictions, those being 2014 through 2016 for federal purposes and 2014
	through 2016 for state purposes.




	Advertising
	Costs


	 

	            The
	Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising costs incurred
	amounted to $9,000 and $11,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	respectively.




	Comprehensive Income
	(Loss)

	 


	            Comprehensive
	income (loss) represents the change in shareholders equity (deficit) of an
	enterprise, other than those resulting from shareholder transactions.
	Accordingly, comprehensive income (loss) may include certain changes in shareholders equity (deficit) that
	are excluded from net income (loss). For the years ended December 31, 2016 and
	2015, the Companys comprehensive loss is the same as its net loss.


	F-11








	Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common
	Share

	 


	            Basic
	net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the
	weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
	net loss per common share is determined using the weighted-average number of
	common shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of
	common stock equivalents. In periods when losses are reported, the
	weighted-average number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock
	equivalents, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.




	Significant Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	            In
	January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-01,

	Clarifying the Definition of a Business

	(ASU 2017-01). The standard
	clarifies the definition of a business by adding guidance to assist entities in
	evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions of
	assets or businesses. ASU 2017-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
	December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Under ASU
	2017-01, to be considered a business, the assets in the transaction need to
	include an input and a substantive process that together significantly
	contribute to the ability to create outputs. Prior to the adoption of the new
	guidance, an acquisition or disposition would be considered a business if there
	were inputs, as well as processes that when applied to those inputs had the
	ability to create outputs. Early adoption is permitted for certain transactions.
	Adoption of ASU 2017-01 may have a material impact on the Companys consolidated
	financial statements if it enters into future business combinations.


	            In
	January 2017, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2017-04,

	Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment

	(ASU 2017-04). ASU 2017-04
	simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the
	goodwill impairment test, which requires a hypothetical purchase price
	allocation. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment
	tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and should be applied
	on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual
	goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The
	Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting
	guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
	financial position.


	            In
	August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,

	Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
	230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of
	the Emerging Issues Task Force).

	This ASU requires changes in the
	presentation of certain items in the statement of cash flows including but not
	limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent
	consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the
	settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned
	life insurance policies and distributions received from equity method investees.
	This guidance will be effective for annual periods and interim periods within
	those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, will require adoption on
	a retrospective basis and will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018.
	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting
	guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
	financial position.


	            In
	June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,

	Financial Instruments - Credit Losses
	(Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

	. The
	amendments within this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in
	current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and
	requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable
	information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal
	years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those
	fiscal years. Entities may early adopt the amendments within this ASU but not
	prior to the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018,
	including the interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply
	the amendments in this Update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
	earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
	is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). However, a
	prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an
	other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date.
	The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting
	guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
	financial position.


	F-12






	            In
	March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,

	Compensation - Stock Compensation
	(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	. This
	ASU is designed to address simplification of several aspects of the accounting
	for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
	classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on
	the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods
	beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual
	periods. Early adoption of this ASU is permitted and would be applied on a
	retrospective basis back to the beginning of fiscal year that included any such
	interim period in which early adoption was elected. The Company is currently
	evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on
	its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.


	            In
	February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,

	Leases

	(Topic 842) which
	requires companies leasing assets to recognize on their balance sheet a
	liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset
	representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on
	contracts longer than one year. The lessee is permitted to make an accounting
	policy election to not recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for
	short-term leases. How leases are recorded on the balance sheet represents a
	significant change from previous GAAP guidance in Topic 840. ASU 2016-02
	maintains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases similar to
	the distinction under previous lease guidance for capital leases and operating
	leases. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new
	accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash
	flows and financial position. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal periods
	beginning after December 15, 2018, and early adoption is permitted. The Company
	is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance
	will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial
	position.


	            In
	January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments - Overall
	(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial
	Liabilities

	. The amendments in this Update address certain aspects of
	recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
	ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
	including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently
	evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting guidance will have on
	its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.


	            In
	July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

	Simplifying the Measurement of
	Inventory

	. ASU 2015-11 simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by
	replacing todays lower of cost or market test with a lower of cost and net
	realizable value test. The guidance applies only to inventories for which cost
	is determined by methods other than last-in first-out (LIFO) and the retail
	inventory method (RIM). Entities that use LIFO or RIM will continue to use
	existing impairment models (e.g., entities using LIFO would apply the lower of
	cost or market test). The guidance is effective for public business entities for
	fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
	fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or
	annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that
	adopting this new accounting guidance will have on its consolidated results of
	operations, cash flows and financial position.

	            In
	May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,

	Revenue from Contracts with
	Customers

	, issued as a new Topic, ASC Topic 606. The new revenue recognition
	standard supersedes all existing revenue recognition guidance. Under this ASU,
	an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services
	to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
	expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2015-14,
	issued in August 2015, deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to the first
	quarter of 2018, with early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017. The
	Company is currently evaluating the effect that adopting this new accounting
	guidance will have on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows and
	financial position.


	            In
	March, April, May, and December 2016, the FASB issued the following updates,
	respectively, to provide supplemental adoption guidance and clarification to ASU
	2014-09. These standards must be adopted concurrently upon the adoption of ASU
	2014-09. We are currently evaluating the potential effects of adopting the
	provisions of these updates.

	Note 5 – Stockholders Equity



	            The
	Company is authorized to issue 75 million shares of common stock, $0.001 par
	value per share. Common stock holders are entitled to one vote per share. The
	Company has no other class of shares authorized.


	            The
	capital structure has been adjusted retrospectively to account for the
	recapitalization resulting from the merger transaction.


	            In
	2016, the Company entered into agreements for consulting services from September
	2016 through February 2017, under which the Company was to issue 6,000,000
	shares of common stock. The Company recognized $360,000 of expense related to
	these services in 2016. The 6,000,000 shares were subsequently issued in
	February 2017.


	            Share-based payments to nonemployees for services provided to the Company totaled $1,490,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Share based payments to employees totaled $355,000 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	Operating Lease




	            The
	Company rents office space from an unrelated party on a month-to-month basis.
	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, rent expense amounted to $19,000
	and $12,000, respectively




	Litigation




	            During
	the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various claims and
	litigation. Management believes that the outcome of such claims or litigation
	will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position,
	results of operations or cash flow.



	Note 7 - Income Tax



	            The Company had no deferred tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 due to a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cumulative federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $2,500,000 and $120,000, respectively, which begin to expire in 2034.


	           
	The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these
	assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination,
	the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including
	future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future
	taxable income and tax planning.


	            Components
	of net deferred taxes, including a full valuation allowance, consisted of the

	            The
	Company reorganized from a sole proprietorship to a corporation in October 2014.
	Accordingly, net operating losses that were incurred prior to the reorganization
	were not carried over to the corporation. The valuation allowance for deferred
	tax assets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $1,101,000 and $47,000, respectively. The
	net operating losses will begin to expire in 2034. Management believes it is
	more likely than not that the deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2016 will
	not be realized based on the managements assessment that the deductions
	ultimately recognized for tax purposes will be fully utilized. Therefore, full
	valuation allowances were set up for these deferred tax assets as of December
	31, 2016 and 2015.


	      
	     For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015,
	the Companys effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to
	state income taxes, nondeductible expenses, and the full valuation allowance.





	Note 8 -  Subsequent Events



	      
	     In accordance with ASC 855, “Subsequent Events”, the Company has evaluated all subsequent events through April 15, 2017, the date the financial statements were available to be issued. The following events occurred after December 31, 2016


	      
	     Issued 6,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to settle deferred compensation expense of approximately $360,000 outstanding as of December 31, 2016.


	      
	     In March 2017, the Company entered issued two convertible promissory notes both in the amount of $110,000 for an aggregate principal amount of $220,000 (the “Notes”). The Notes accrue interest at 10% per annum with the principal and accrued interest due and payable in October 2017. The principal amount and all accrued interest are convertible into shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate $0.10 per share, subject to adjustments for events of default. Each holder was issued a warrant to purchase 187,500, for a total of 375,000, of the Company’s common stock with a strike price of $0.12 per share, subject to adjustments. Events of default include non-compliance with the Exchange Act. Should the Company be found in default, the conversion rate would be adjusted to 24%, and the conversion rate would be adjusted to the lower of $0.10 or 65% of the average of the 2 lowest sale prices and trading prices as defined in the agreements during the 25 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the conversion date or the closing bid price, whichever is lower, or $0.00001 if the company loses the bid. There is also an adjustment if the stock becomes chilled, or in the case of dilutive issuances.

	Item 9A. Controls and Procedures




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
	information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the
	Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
	period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and
	procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to
	ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the
	Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief
	Executive Officer covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under
	the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our
	Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the
	design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December
	31, 2016 (the Evaluation Date). Based upon the evaluation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the Evaluation Date, the Chief Executive Officer
	and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
	procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material
	weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified
	below, which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and
	procedures.



	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting



	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
	adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
	Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a
	process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of
	directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
	of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	Our internal control over financial reporting includes those
	policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
	reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
	dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
	are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
	accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
	America, and our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance
	with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
	acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect
	on the financial statements.


	Because of its inherent limitations, internal controls over
	financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal
	control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations,
	including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding
	controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting
	can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement
	preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
	periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
	changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate.






	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal
	control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this
	assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
	Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
	Framework. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that there are
	material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and
	Management has concluded that the Companys internal controls over financial
	reporting are not effective as of December 31, 2016. A material weakness is a
	deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over
	financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
	misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
	or detected on a timely basis.


	The material weaknesses relate to inadequate internal controls
	over financial reporting, and the lack of segregation of duties in our financial
	reporting process. We do not have a separately designated audit committee. These
	weaknesses are due to our lack of excess working capital required to hire
	additional resources. To remedy these material weaknesses, we intend to engage
	an internal accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our
	finances will allow.


	Rose Snyder & Jacobs LLP, our registered independent public
	accounting firm, was not required to and has not issued a report concerning the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December
	31, 2016.



	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting



	There were no changes in our internal control over financial
	reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016
	that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
	our internal control over financial reporting.



	Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls



	Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
	Financial Officer, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal
	controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how
	well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
	assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design
	of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints,
	and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because
	of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls
	can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
	if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations
	include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
	breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally,
	controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by
	collusion of two or more people, or by management or board override of the
	control.


	The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon
	certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no
	assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all
	potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because
	of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or
	procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a
	cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
	not be detected.

	PART III






	Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate
	Governance.

	Officers hold their positions at the will of the Board of Directors. There are
	no arrangements, agreements or understandings between non-management
	shareholders and management under which non-management shareholders may directly
	or indirectly participate in or influence the management of our affairs.

	corporations, including a stint as a Business Product Growth Consultant for
	Chevron Inc. from July 2014  December 2014, where he was served as a liaison

	those requirements in the deliverables, including working with the technical and
	business teams to prepare the quality assurance testing plans and validation of
	the sprint goals. Also, Mr. Aro served as a Business Analyst Consultant for

	Flitways Technology Inc. in January 2013 and has been the companys CEO and
	Director since that time.


	Mr. Aro does not currently serve on the boards of other public
	companies.







	Significant Employees



	There are no individuals other than our executive officer who
	make a significant contribution to our business.



	Family Relationships



	There are no family relationships among our officers or
	directors.



	Legal Proceedings



	None of our directors, executive officers, promoters or control
	persons has been involved in any of the following events during the past five
	years:




	any bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such
	person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the
	bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;




	any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending
	criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);




	being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed,
	suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or
	temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his
	involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or




	being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the
	SEC or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or
	state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed,
	suspended, or vacated.





	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Compliance Reporting



	Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires a
	companys directors and officers, and persons who own more than ten-percent
	(10%) of the companys common stock, to file with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission reports of ownership on Form 3 and reports of change in ownership on
	Forms 4 and 5. Such officers, directors and ten-percent stockholders are also
	required to furnish the company with copies of all Section 16(a) reports they
	file. Based solely on our review of the copies of such forms received by us and
	on written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all
	Section 16(a) reports applicable to our officers, directors and ten-percent
	stockholders with respect to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 were filed.



	Code of Ethics



	We have not yet adopted a code of ethics that applies to our
	principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting
	officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions because we have
	not yet finalized the content of such a code. Companies whose equity securities
	are listed for trading on the OTC Pink Sheets are not currently required to
	implement a code of ethics.







	Director Nominees



	As of December 31, 2016 there have been no material changes to
	the procedures by which security holders may recommend nominees to our Board of
	Directors.



	Audit Committee



	The functions of the Audit Committee are currently carried out
	by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has determined that we do not
	presently need an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors
	carrying out the duties of the Audit Committee. Our Board of Directors has
	determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as one of our
	directors and to be a member of the Audit Committee or otherwise perform Audit
	Committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert on the
	Audit Committee.






	Item 11. Executive Compensation.



	The following Summary Compensation Table sets forth the total
	annual compensation paid or accrued by us to or for the account of the Principal
	Executive Officer (PEO) and our Principal Financial Officer (PFO). None of
	our other executive officers received compensation in excess of $100,000 during
	the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.

As of March 24, 2017, there were 58,429,281 common shares issued and outstanding. All persons named have sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares, except as otherwise noted.

	Calculated based on issued and outstanding shares of
	58,429,281 as March 24, 2017.






	Pension, Retirement or Similar Benefit Plans



	There are no arrangements or plans in which we provide pension,
	retirement or similar benefits to our directors or executive officers. We have
	no material bonus or profit sharing plans pursuant to which cash or non-cash
	compensation is or may be paid to our directors or executive officers, except
	that stock options may be granted at the discretion of the Board of Directors or
	a committee thereof.



	Compensation Committee



	We currently do not have a compensation committee of the Board
	of Directors or a committee performing a similar function. It is the view of the
	Board that it is appropriate for us not to have such a committee because of our
	size and because the Board as a whole determines executive compensation. Each of
	our directors is also is a senior officer of the company.



	Compensation Committee Report



	Our Board of Directors as a whole has revised and discussed the
	compensation discussion and analysis disclosed in this Form 10-K and based on
	this review and discussion, has determined that the disclosure be included in
	this annual report.



	Compensation of Directors



	We do not pay our directors any fees for attendance at Board
	meetings or similar remuneration or reimburse them for any out-of-pocket
	expenses incurred by them in connection with our business.







	Change of Control



	As of December 31, 2016 we had no pension plans or compensatory
	plans or other arrangements which provide compensation in the event of a
	termination of employment or a change in our control.






	Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and
	Director Independence




	Director Independence



	The OTC Pink Sheets on which our common shares are listed on
	does not have any director independence requirements. We also do not have a
	definition of independence as our directors also hold positions executive
	officer positions with us. Once we engage further directors and officers, we
	plan to develop a definition of independence and scrutinize our Board of
	Directors with regards to this definition.






	Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services






	Audit, Audit-Related and Non-Audit Fees



	The following table represents fees for the professional audit services and fees billed for other services rendered by our auditors, Rose, Snynder & Jacobs, LLP and Squar Milner LLP for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively and any other fees billed for other services rendered during that period.

	CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE




	      
	     

	FOR VALUE RECEIVED

	,

	FLITWAYS TECHNOLOGY,
	INC.

	, a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the Borrower), hereby
	promises to pay to the order of

	AUCTUS FUND, LLC

	, a Delaware limited
	liability company, or registered assigns (the Holder) the sum of US$110,000.00
	together with any interest as set forth herein, on October 6, 2017 (the
	Maturity Date), and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at
	the rate of ten percent (10%) (the Interest Rate) per annum from the date
	hereof (the Issue Date) until the same becomes due and payable, whether at
	maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or otherwise. This Note may not
	be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein
	with the written consent of the Holder which may be withheld for any reason or
	for no reason. Any amount of principal or interest on this Note which is not
	paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-four percent (24%) per
	annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid (the Default Interest).
	Interest shall commence accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and
	shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days
	elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common
	stock, $0.001 par value per share (the Common Stock) in accordance with the
	terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All
	payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the
	Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note.
	Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any
	day which is not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next
	succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment
	date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of
	the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
	the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term
	business day shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on
	which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or required by law or executive order to remain closed. Each
	capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning
	ascribed thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date
	hereof, pursuant to which this Note was originally issued (the Purchase
	Agreement).






	            This
	Note is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the
	issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other similar
	rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability
	upon the holder thereof.


	            The
	following terms shall apply to this Note:


	ARTICLE I. CONVERSION RIGHTS


	                   1.1

	Conversion Right

	. The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and
	at any time following the Issue Date and ending on the later of (i) the Maturity
	Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article
	III) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining
	outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any part of the
	outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and
	non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue
	Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into
	which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the
	Conversion Price (as defined below) determined as provided herein (a
	Conversion);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that in no event shall the
	Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion
	of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of
	Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than
	shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the
	ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or
	unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a
	limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
	herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
	conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination
	of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the
	Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common
	Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence,
	beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
	Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and
	Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such
	proviso,

	provided

	,

	further

	,

	however

	, that the limitations
	on conversion may be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder,
	not less than 61 days prior notice to the Borrower, and the provisions of the
	conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later
	date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice of
	waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion
	of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
	below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified
	in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the
	Notice of Conversion), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance
	with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by
	facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to
	result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on
	such conversion date (the Conversion Date). The term Conversion Amount
	means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the
	principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion

	plus

	(2)
	at the Holders option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal
	amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,
	provided however, that the Borrower shall have the right to pay any or all
	interest in cash

	plus

	(3) at the Holders option, Default Interest, if
	any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
	(2)

	plus

	(4) at the Holders option, any amounts owed to the Holder
	pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof.

	1.2

	Conversion Price

	.


	                          

	Calculation
	of Conversion Price

	. Subject to the adjustments described herein, the
	conversion price (the Conversion Price) shall equal $0.10 per share (the
	Fixed Conversion Price), provided, however, that if an Event of Default (as
	defined herein) occurs at any time after the Issue Date, then the Conversion
	Price shall equal the lesser of (i) the Fixed Conversion Price and (ii) the
	Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments
	for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating
	to the Borrowers securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the
	Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary
	distributions and similar events). The Variable Conversion Price shall mean
	65% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount
	rate of 35%). Market Price means the average of the two (2) lowest Trading
	Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty-five (25)
	Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the
	Conversion Date. Trading Price or Trading Prices means, for any security as
	of any date, the lesser of: (i) the lowest trade price on the OTC Pink, OTCQB or
	applicable trading market as reported by a reliable reporting service
	(Reporting Service) designated by the Holder or, if the OTC Pink is not the
	principal trading market for such security, the trading price of such security
	on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is
	listed or traded or, if no trading price of such security is available in any of
	the foregoing manners, the average of the trading prices of any market makers
	for such security that are listed in the pink sheets by the National Quotation
	Bureau, Inc., or (ii) the closing bid price on the OTC Pink, OTCQB or applicable
	trading market as reported by a Reporting Service designated by the Holder or,
	if the OTC Pink is not the principal trading market for such security, the
	closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or
	trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid
	price of such security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average
	of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed
	in the pink sheets by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. To the extent the
	Conversion Price of the Borrowers Common Stock closes below the par value per
	share, the Borrower will take all steps necessary to solicit the consent of the
	stockholders to reduce the par value to the lowest value possible under law. The
	Borrower agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this adjustment.
	Furthermore, the Conversion Price may be adjusted downward if, within three (3)
	business days of the transmittal of the Notice of Conversion to the Borrower,
	the Common Stock has a closing bid which is 5% or lower than that set forth in
	the Notice of Conversion. If the shares of the Borrowers Common Stock have not
	been delivered within three (3) business days to the Borrower, the Notice of
	Conversion may be rescinded. At any time after the Closing Date, if in the case
	that the Borrowers Common Stock is not deliverable by DWAC (including if the
	Borrowers transfer agent has a policy prohibiting or limiting delivery of
	shares of the Borrowers Common Stock specified in a Notice of Conversion), an additional 10%
	discount will apply for all future conversions under all Notes. If in the case
	that the Borrowers Common Stock is chilled for deposit into the DTC system
	and only eligible for clearing deposit, an additional 15% discount shall apply
	for all future conversions under all Notes while the chill is in effect. If in
	the case of both of the above, an additional cumulative 25% discount shall
	apply. Additionally, if the Company ceases to be a reporting company pursuant to
	the 1934 Act or if the Note cannot be converted into free trading shares after
	six months from the Issue Date, an additional 15% discount will be attributed to
	the Conversion Price. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such
	security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be
	the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of
	a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of
	the Trading Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such
	Notes. Trading Day shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable
	for any period on the OTC Pink, OTCQB or on the principal securities exchange or
	other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. The
	Borrower shall be responsible for the fees of its transfer agent and all DTC
	fees associated with any such issuance. Holder shall be entitled to deduct
	$500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover
	Holders deposit fees associated with each Notice of Conversion.

	            While
	this Note is outstanding, each time any 3

	rd

	party has the right to
	convert monies owed to that 3

	rd

	party (or receive shares pursuant to
	a settlement or otherwise), including but not limited to under Section 3(a)(9)
	and Section 3(a)(10), at a discount to market greater than the Conversion Price
	in effect at that time (prior to all other applicable adjustments in the Note),
	then the H1older, in Holders sole discretion, may utilize such greater discount
	percentage (prior to all applicable adjustments in this Note) until this Note is
	no longer outstanding. While this Note is outstanding, each time any
	3

	rd

	party has a look back period greater than the look back period in
	effect under the Note at that time, including but not limited to under Section
	3(a)(9) and Section 3(a)(10), then the Holder, in Holders sole discretion,
	may utilize such greater number of look back days until this Note is no longer
	outstanding. The Borrower shall give written notice to the Holder within one (1)
	business day of becoming aware of any event that could permit the Holder to make
	any adjustment described in the two immediately preceding sentences.


	                                 (a)

	Conversion Price During Major Announcements

	. Notwithstanding anything
	contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes
	a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge with any other
	corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or
	continuing corporation and its capital stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer
	all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group
	or entity (including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase
	50% or more of the Borrowers Common Stock (or any other takeover scheme) (the
	date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter
	referred to as the Announcement Date), then the Conversion Price shall,
	effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted
	Conversion Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of
	(x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for a Conversion
	occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would
	otherwise be in effect. From and after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination
	Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section
	1.2(a) . For purposes hereof, Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date shall
	mean, with respect to any proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as
	contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the date upon which the
	Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in
	the case of clause (ii) above) consummates or publicly announces the termination
	or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
	which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.

	                                 (b)       

	Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes

	. In the event of a dispute as to the number
	of shares of Common Stock issuable to the Holder in connection with a conversion
	of this Note, the Borrower shall issue to the Holder the number of shares of
	Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section
	4.13.


	                          1.3

	Authorized Shares

	. The Borrower covenants that during the period the
	conversion right exists, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and
	unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive
	rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of
	this Note issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The Borrower is required at
	all times to have authorized and reserved seven times the number of shares that
	is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion
	Price of the Notes in effect from time to time) (the Reserved Amount). The
	Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in accordance with the
	Borrowers obligations pursuant to Section 3(d) of the Purchase Agreement. The
	Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly
	issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue
	any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change
	the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible
	at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make
	proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares
	of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for
	conversion of the outstanding Notes. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has
	irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common
	Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance
	of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are
	charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the
	necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms
	and conditions of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall
	the Reserved Amount be lower than the initial Reserved Amount, regardless of any
	prior conversions.


	                          If,
	at any time the Borrower does not maintain or replenish the Reserved Amount
	within three (3) business days of the request of the Holder, the principal
	amount of the Note shall increase by Five Thousand and No/100 United States
	Dollars ($5,000) (under Holders and Borrowers expectation that any principal
	amount increase will tack back to the Issue Date) per occurrence.


	                          1.4

	Method of Conversion

	.


	                                 (a)

	Mechanics of Conversion

	. Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be
	converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after
	the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by
	facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the
	Conversion Date prior to 5:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this
	Note at the principal office of the Borrower.


	5






	                                 (b)

	Surrender of Note Upon Conversion

	. Notwithstanding anything to the
	contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the
	terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note
	to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so
	converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the
	principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use
	such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as
	not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the
	event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,

	prima facie,

	be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest
	error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted
	as aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first
	physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will
	forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like
	tenor, registered as the Holder (upon payment by the Holder of any applicable
	transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid
	principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of
	this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this
	paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and
	unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less
	than the amount stated on the face hereof.


	                                 (c)

	Payment of Taxes

	. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which
	may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of
	shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this
	Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the
	Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other
	securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the
	Holder or the custodian in whose street name such shares are to be held for the
	Holders account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the
	Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the
	satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid.


	                                 (d)

	Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion

	. Upon receipt by the Borrower
	from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means
	of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for
	conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver
	or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder
	certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3)
	business days after such receipt (the Deadline) (and, solely in the case of
	conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note)
	in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.


	                                 (e)

	Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock

	. Upon receipt by the
	Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder
	of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding
	principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note
	shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults
	on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion
	of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to
	receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein
	provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of
	Conversion as provided herein, the Borrowers obligation to issue and deliver
	the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional,
	irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any
	waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any
	judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or
	delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder
	of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination,
	or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower,
	and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such
	obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
	Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
	Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 5:00
	p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.


	6






	                                        (f)

	Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer

	. In lieu of delivering
	physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion,
	provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company (DTC)
	Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) program, upon request of the Holder
	and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in this
	Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
	cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable
	upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holders Prime Broker
	with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) system.


	                                        (g)

	DTC Eligibility & Sub-Penny

	. If the Borrower fails to maintain its
	status as DTC Eligible for any reason, or, if the Conversion Price is less
	than $0.01, the principal amount of the Note shall increase by Fifteen Thousand
	and No/100 United States Dollars ($15,000) (under Holders and Borrowers
	expectation that any principal amount increase will tack back to the Issue
	Date). In addition, the Variable Conversion Price shall be redefined to mean
	forty percent (40%) multiplied by the Market Price, subject to adjustment as
	provided in this Note.


	                                        (h)

	Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Delivery Deadline

	. Without in
	any way limiting the Holders right to pursue other remedies, including actual
	damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the
	Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the
	Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3
	above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay
	to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the
	Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock until the Borrower issues and
	delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance account with
	OTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled
	upon such Holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder's and
	Borrower's expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issue Date).. Such
	cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the
	month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice
	to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it
	has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which
	event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note
	and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note.
	The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder.
	The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with
	such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
	the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this
	Section 1.4(h) are justified.


	7






	                                        (i)

	Rescindment of a Notice of Conversion

	. If (i) the Borrower fails to
	respond to Holder within one (1) business day from the Conversion Date
	confirming the details of Notice of Conversion, (ii) the Borrower fails to
	provide any of the shares of the Borrowers Common Stock requested in the Notice
	of Conversion within three (3) business days from the date of receipt of the
	Note of Conversion, (iii) the Holder is unable to procure a legal opinion
	required to have the shares of the Borrowers Common Stock issued unrestricted
	and/or deposited to sell for any reason related to the Borrowers standing, (iv)
	the Holder is unable to deposit the shares of the Borrowers Common Stock
	requested in the Notice of Conversion for any reason related to the Borrowers
	standing, (v) at any time after a missed Deadline, at the Holders sole
	discretion, or (vi) if OTC Markets changes the Borrower's designation to
	Limited Information (Yield), No Information (Stop Sign), Caveat Emptor
	(Skull & Crossbones), OTC, Other OTC or Grey Market (Exclamation Mark
	Sign) or other trading restriction on the day of or any day after the Conversion
	Date, the Holder maintains the option and sole discretion to rescind the Notice
	of Conversion (Rescindment) with a Notice of Rescindment.


	                          1.5

	Concerning the Shares

	. The shares of Common Stock issuable upon
	conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares
	are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii)
	the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of
	counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for
	opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to
	be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from
	such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule
	144 under the Act (or a successor rule) (Rule 144) or (iv) such shares are
	transferred to an affiliate (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who
	agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this
	Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase
	Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement (and subject
	to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of
	Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under
	the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as
	to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately
	sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
	this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement
	or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an
	exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially
	in the following form, as appropriate:






	NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE
	SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
	1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE
	OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN
	EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR
	(B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A
	GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR
	(II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT.
	NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH
	A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.






	8






	                          The
	legend set forth above shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the
	Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the
	Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in
	form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable
	transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock
	may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be
	reasonably accepted by the Borrower so that the sale or transfer is effected or
	(ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such
	security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration
	statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144
	without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date
	that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Borrower does not
	accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer
	of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144 or
	Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default
	pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note.


	                          1.6

	Effect of Certain Events

	.


	                                 (a)

	Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc

	. At the option of the Holder, the
	sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
	Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related
	transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is
	disposed of, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the
	Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the
	Borrower is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of
	Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be
	required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to
	such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article
	III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof. Person shall mean
	any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
	association, trust or other entity or organization.

	                                 (b)

	Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc

	. If, at any time when this
	Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes,
	there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
	reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common
	Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of
	shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or
	another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all
	of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
	liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have
	the right to receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the
	terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon
	conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been
	entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full
	immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on
	conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall
	be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to
	the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions
	for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon
	conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be
	practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon
	the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described
	in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable,
	thirty (30) days prior written notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15)
	days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of
	shareholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation
	of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
	reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the
	Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting successor
	or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the
	obligations of this Section 1.6(b) . The above provisions shall similarly apply
	to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.


	                                 (c)

	Adjustment Due to Distribution

	. If the Borrower shall declare or make any
	distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of
	Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or
	otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrowers shareholders
	in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary
	(i.e., a spin-off)) (a Distribution), then the Holder of this Note shall be
	entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for
	determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of
	such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the
	shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the
	holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
	of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.


	                                 (d)

	Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance

	. If, at any time when any Notes are
	issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
	Section 1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, except for shares of
	Common Stock issued directly to vendors or suppliers of the Borrower in
	satisfaction of amounts owed to such vendors or suppliers (provided, however,
	that such vendors or suppliers shall not have an arrangement to transfer, sell
	or assign such shares of Common Stock prior to the issuance of such shares), any
	shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration per share
	(before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting
	discounts or allowances in connection therewith) less than the Conversion Price
	in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of
	Common Stock (a Dilutive Issuance), then immediately upon the Dilutive
	Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the
	consideration per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance.


	10






	                                 The
	Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the
	Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
	including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable,
	to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or other securities convertible
	into or exchangeable for Common Stock (Convertible Securities) (such warrants,
	rights and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are
	hereinafter referred to as Options) and the price per share for which Common
	Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion
	Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per
	share. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the price per share for which
	Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is determined by
	dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as
	consideration for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum
	aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower
	upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible
	Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options, the minimum aggregate
	amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange
	thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or
	exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
	issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of
	Convertible Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion
	Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon the
	exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible
	Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options.


	                                 Additionally,
	the Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if
	the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities, whether
	or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the
	exercise of Options), and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable
	upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in
	effect, then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For
	the purposes of the preceding sentence, the price per share for which Common
	Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is determined by dividing
	(i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as
	consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus
	the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the
	Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible
	Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total
	number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all
	such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
	be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or
	exchange of such Convertible Securities.


	                                 (e)

	Purchase Rights

	. If, at any time when any Notes are issued and
	outstanding, the Borrower issues any convertible securities or rights to
	purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the Purchase Rights)
	pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of
	this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such
	Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have
	acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable
	upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
	conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is
	taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights or, if no such
	record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to
	be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.


	11






	                                 (f)

	Notice of Adjustments

	. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or
	readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this
	Section 1.6, the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute such
	adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate
	setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
	upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon
	the written request at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like
	certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
	Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common
	Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or property which at the time
	would be received upon conversion of the Note.


	                          1.7

	Trading Market Limitations

	. Unless permitted by the applicable rules and
	regulations of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then
	listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon conversion of or
	otherwise pursuant to this Note and the other Notes issued pursuant to the
	Purchase Agreement more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that
	the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal United States
	securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the Maximum Share
	Amount), which shall be 4.99% of the total shares outstanding on the Closing
	Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), subject to equitable adjustment
	from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital
	reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after
	the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if the Borrower
	fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or
	regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other
	self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its
	securities on the Borrowers ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess
	of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note,
	this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note.


	                          1.8

	Status as Shareholder

	. Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a
	Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which
	cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holders allocated
	portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed
	converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holders rights as a Holder
	of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only
	the right to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any
	remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such
	Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this
	Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received certificates
	for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the
	expiration of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this
	Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its
	status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder
	shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Note with respect to such
	unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as
	practicable, return such unconverted Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not
	been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note
	has not been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights
	and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion
	Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such
	Conversion Default and any subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to
	have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent
	conversions determined in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrowers
	failure to convert this Note.

	                          1.9

	. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
	Note, the Borrower may prepay the amounts outstanding hereunder pursuant to the
	following terms and conditions:


	                                 (a)
	At any time during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on the date

	to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued
	interest), in full by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal
	to 115%, multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of
	this Note

	plus

	(x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal

	exercisable on not less than three (3) Trading Days prior written notice to the
	Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued
	interest), in full by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal
	to 135%, multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of
	this Note

	plus

	(x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal
	amount of this Note

	Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued

	this Note

	plus

	(x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal
	amount of this Note

	plus

	(y) Default Interest, if any.


	                                 (d)
	After the expiration of two hundred ten (210) days following the date of the
	Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.


	Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an Optional Prepayment
	Notice) shall be delivered to the Holder of the Note at its registered
	addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to
	prepay the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which shall be not more than
	three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment Notice. On the
	date fixed for prepayment (the Optional Prepayment Date), the Borrower shall
	make payment of the applicable prepayment amount to or upon the order of the
	Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at least one (1)
	business day prior to the Optional Prepayment Date. If the Borrower delivers an
	Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the applicable prepayment amount due
	to the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the Optional
	Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit its right to prepay the Note
	pursuant to this Section 1.9.

	Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of
	Default specified in Section 3.1 (solely with respect to failure to pay the
	principal hereof or interest thereon when due at the Maturity Date), the Note
	shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the
	Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to
	the Default Sum (as defined herein). UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE
	CONTINUATION OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT SPECIFIED IN SECTION 3.2, THE NOTE SHALL
	BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE AND THE BORROWER SHALL PAY TO THE HOLDER, IN
	FULL SATISFACTION OF ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO: (Y) THE
	DEFAULT SUM (AS DEFINED HEREIN); MULTIPLIED BY (Z) TWO (2). Upon the occurrence
	and during the continuation of any Event of Default specified in Sections 3.1
	(solely with respect to failure to pay the principal hereof or interest thereon
	when due on this Note upon acceleration), 3.3, 3.4, 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11,
	3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, 3.16. 3.17, 3.18, 3.19, 3.20, and/or 3.21 exercisable
	through the delivery of written notice to the Borrower by such Holders (the
	Default Notice), and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified the
	remaining sections of Article III (other than failure to pay the principal
	hereof or interest thereon at the Maturity Date specified in Section 3.1
	hereof), the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower
	shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an
	amount equal to (i) 150%

	times

	the

	sum

	of (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note

	plus

	(x)
	accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the
	date of payment (the Mandatory Prepayment Date)

	plus

	(y) Default
	Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and/or (x)

	plus

	(z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and
	1.4(g) hereof (the then outstanding principal amount of this Note to the date of
	payment

	plus

	the amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall
	collectively be known as the Default Sum) or (ii) at the option of the Holder,
	the parity value of the Default Sum to be prepaid, where parity value means
	(a) the highest number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or
	otherwise pursuant to such Default Sum in accordance with Article I, treating
	the Trading Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the
	Conversion Date for purposes of determining the lowest applicable Conversion
	Price, unless the Default Event arises as a result of a breach in respect of a
	specific Conversion Date in which case such Conversion Date shall be the
	Conversion Date),

	multiplied by

	(b) the highest Trading Price for the
	Common Stock during the period beginning on the date of first occurrence of the
	Event of Default and ending one day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date (the
	Default Amount) and all other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately
	become due and payable, all without demand, presentment or notice, all of which
	hereby are expressly waived, together with all costs, including, without
	limitation, legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be
	entitled to exercise all other rights and remedies available at law or in
	equity. Further, if a breach of Sections 3.9, 3.10 and/or 3.19 occurs or is
	continuing after the six (6) month anniversary of this Note, then the principal
	amount of the Note shall increase by Fifteen Thousand and No/100 United States
	Dollars ($15,000) (under Holders and Borrowers expectation that any principal
	amount increase will tack back to the Issue Date) and the Holder shall be
	entitled to use the lowest Trading Price during the delinquency period as a base
	price for the conversion with the Variable Conversion Price shall be redefined
	to mean forty percent (40%) multiplied by the Market Price, subject to
	adjustment as provided in this Note. For example, if the lowest Trading Price
	during the delinquency period is $0.01 per share and the conversion discount is
	50%, then the Holder may elect to convert future conversions at $0.005 per
	share. If this Note is not paid at Maturity Date, then the outstanding principal
	due under this Note shall increase by Fifteen Thousand and No/100 United States
	Dollars ($15,000).


	If the Borrower fails to pay the Default Amount within five (5)
	business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the
	Holder shall have the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in
	default (and so long and to the extent that there are sufficient authorized
	shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in
	lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares of Common Stock of the Borrower
	equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price then in effect. This
	requirement by the Borrower shall automatically apply upon the occurrence of an
	Event of Default without the need for any party to give any notice or take any
	other action.


	If the Holder shall commence an action or proceeding to enforce
	any provisions of this Note, including, without limitation, engaging an
	attorney, then if the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be
	reimbursed by the Borrower for its attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses
	incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or
	proceeding.

	all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, shall mean this
	instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as
	originally executed, or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or

	                          4.4

	Assignability

	. This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its
	successors and assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its
	successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an accredited

	The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree
	that following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted
	principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the
	amount stated on the face hereof.


	                          4.5

	Cost of Collection

	. If default is made in the payment of this Note, the
	Borrower shall pay the Holder hereof reasonable costs of collection, including
	reasonable attorneys fees.


	                          4.6

	Governing Law

	. This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
	with the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to principles of conflicts
	of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the
	transactions contemplated by this Note shall be brought only in the state courts
	of Massachusetts or in the federal courts located in the Commonwealth of
	Massachusetts. The parties to this Note hereby irrevocably waive any objection
	to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not
	assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon

	forum
	non conveniens

	.

	THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY
	HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY
	DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTE OR ANY

	rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that
	it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such
	statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or
	unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
	any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal
	service of process and consents to process being served in any suit, action or
	proceeding in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document

	(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices
	to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good
	and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein
	shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to serve process in any other
	manner permitted by law.


	21






	                          4.7

	Certain Amounts

	. Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required
	to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion
	thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus
	Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the
	actual damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may
	be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower
	represents stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate
	the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note and to earn
	a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of
	this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant to
	this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of
	stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the
	Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert
	this Note into shares of Common Stock.


	                          4.8

	Purchase Agreement

	. By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to
	be bound by the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.


	                          4.9

	Notice of Corporate Events

	. Except as otherwise provided below, the
	Holder of this Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and
	only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock. The Borrower
	shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the
	Borrowers shareholders (and copies of proxy materials and other information
	sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of
	its shareholders for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to
	receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe
	for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation,
	reclassification or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other
	securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose of
	determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any
	proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of
	the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
	Borrower, the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder, at least twenty (20)
	days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to
	the consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date
	on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
	distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount
	and character of such dividend, distribution, right or other event to the extent
	known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event
	requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with
	the notification to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.9
	including, but not limited to, name changes, recapitalizations, etc. as soon as
	possible under law.


	22






	                          4.10

	Usury

	. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed
	interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the
	applicable provision shall automatically be revised to equal the maximum rate of
	interest or other amount deemed interest permitted under applicable law. The
	Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not
	seek to claim or take advantage of any law that would prohibit or forgive the
	Borrower from paying all or a portion of the principal or interest on this Note.


	                          4.11

	Remedies

	. The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its
	obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating
	the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the
	Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations
	under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or
	threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the
	Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies at law or
	in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
	or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to
	enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without the necessity of
	showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. No
	provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Borrower,
	which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, and interest on,
	this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed.


	                          4.12

	Severability

	. In the event that any provision of this Note is invalid or
	unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision
	shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and
	shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any
	provision hereof which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall
	not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof.


	                          4.13

	Dispute Resolution

	. In the case of a dispute as to the determination of
	the Conversion Price, Conversion Amount, any prepayment amount or Default
	Amount, Default Sum, Closing or Maturity Date, the closing bid price, or fair
	market value (as the case may be) or the arithmetic calculation of the
	Conversion Price or the applicable prepayment amount(s) (as the case may be),
	the Borrower or the Holder shall submit the disputed determinations or
	arithmetic calculations via facsimile (i) within two (2) Business Days after
	receipt of the applicable notice giving rise to such dispute to the Borrower or
	the Holder or (ii) if no notice gave rise to such dispute, at any time after the
	Holder learned of the circumstances giving rise to such dispute. If the Holder
	and the Borrower are unable to agree upon such determination or calculation
	within two (2) Business Days of such disputed determination or arithmetic
	calculation (as the case may be) being submitted to the Borrower or the Holder,
	then the Borrower shall, within two (2) Business Days, submit via facsimile (a)
	the disputed determination of the Conversion Price, the closing bid price, the
	or fair market value (as the case may be) to an independent, reputable
	investment bank selected by the Borrower and approved by the Holder or (b) the
	disputed arithmetic calculation of the Conversion Price, Conversion Amount, any
	prepayment amount or Default Amount, Default Sum to an independent, outside
	accountant selected by the Holder that is reasonably acceptable to the Borrower.
	The Borrower shall cause at its expense the investment bank or the accountant to
	perform the determinations or calculations and notify the Borrower and the
	Holder of the results no later than ten (10) Business Days from the time it
	receives such disputed determinations or calculations. Such investment banks
	or accountants determination or calculation shall be binding upon all parties
	absent demonstrable error.


	23






	                          4.14

	Terms of Future Financings.

	So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any
	issuance by the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries of any security with any
	term more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of
	the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to the Holder in
	this Note, then the Borrower shall notify the Holder of such additional or more
	favorable term and such term, at Holders option, shall become a part of the
	transaction documents with the Holder. The types of terms contained in another
	security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security include, but
	are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, prepayment rate,
	conversion lookback periods, interest rates, original issue discounts, stock
	sale price, private placement price per share, and warrant coverage.


	                          4.15

	Piggyback Registration

	Rights. The Borrower shall include on the next
	registration statement the Borrower files with SEC (or on the subsequent
	registration statement if such registration statement is withdrawn) all shares
	issuable upon conversion of this Note. Failure to do so will result in
	liquidated damages of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of this Note, but
	not less than Fifteen Thousand and No/100 United States Dollars ($15,000), being
	immediately due and payable to the Holder at its election in the form of cash
	payment or addition to the balance of this Note.

	CERTIFICATION PURSUANT TO



	18 U.S.C. ss 1350, AS
	ADOPTED PURSUANT TO



	SECTION 302 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002




	I, Tobi Mac Aro, certify that:




	1.



	I have reviewed this Annual Report on Form 10-K of
	FlitWays Technology Inc.;





	 


	 


	 




	2.



	Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any
	untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
	necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under
	which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period
	covered by this report;





	 


	 


	 




	3.



	Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and
	other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
	material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
	flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this
	report;





	 


	 


	 




	4.



	I am responsible for establishing and maintaining
	disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-
	15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as
	defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant
	and have:





	 


	 


	 






	a.



	Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or
	caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
	supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
	registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
	by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which
	this report is being prepared;





	 


	 


	 






	b.



	Designed such internal control over financial reporting,
	or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed
	under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
	reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
	statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
	accounting principles;





	 


	 


	 






	c.



	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's
	disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our
	conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
	procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on
	such evaluation; and





	 


	 


	 






	d.



	Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's
	internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the
	registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal
	quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or
	is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal
	control over financial reporting; and





	 


	 


	 




	5.



	I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation of
	internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors
	and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
	performing the equivalent functions):





	 


	 


	 






	a.



	All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
	the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
	record, process, summarize and report financial information; and





	 


	 


	 






	b.



	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
	management or other employees who have a significant role in the
	registrant's internal control over financial
	reporting.








	Date: April 17, 2017

Transpertation https://flitways.com/   FlitWays Technology Inc. completes Name Change -- New Trading Symbol FTWS CULVER CITY, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/10/16 -- Cataca Resources, Inc. (OTC PINK: CATQ) is pleased to announce that the company has received regulatory approval from FINRA for its previously announced name change to Flitways Technology Inc. As a result of the approved name change, effective on November 10, 2016, Flitways Technology Inc. common shares will begin trading under the new ticker symbol FTWS. FlitWays founder Tobi Mac commented, "With our publicly traded company now carrying the Flitways name, we will be able to better build our corporate brand and be more easily identifiable in the rapidly evolving ground transportation marketplace. Over the next several weeks, we anticipate this will allow us the opportunity to introduce FlitWays to a much larger audience of potential industry partners and investors." About FlitWays Technology Inc. FlitWays, a Los Angeles-based travel technology company, offers Pre-Booked and On-Demand ground transportation in 170 cities around the world -- including rideshares, taxis, black cars, and airport shuttles. Currently servicing over 400 airports with a fleet of over 20,000 vehicles, FlitWays is there to handle all travel ride needs. FlitWays provides security and peace of mind for both business and private travelers with secure booking and all-inclusive rates. For additional information regarding FlitWays, visit www.FlitWays.com. Additional information regarding Flitways Technology, Inc. can also be found in the Company's most recent filings with SEC at www.sec.gov and further Company press releases. Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information . FlitWays Technology's business model is focused to offer corporations and travel suppliers a seamless pre-booked ground transportation service that meets their unique travel and service needs. To achieve this, FlitWays has already internally established direct contracts with over 15,000 local licensed and certified drivers in over 175 cities and 400 airports. The FlitWays network empowers several Fortune 100 corporations and travel suppliers with reliable, safe, and affordable ground transportation service, including American Express, Amazon, Samsung, Rolls-Royce, Xerox, TUI Group, and many more. In addition, FlitWays has simplified the process of booking ground travel by building direct API integrations with major travel suppliers (e.g. Booking.com, Kayak) to offer seamless ground travel booking to their travelers. FlitWays currently has 20+ Active Revenue Agreements with corporate accounts and travel resellers, and additional Beta Test Agreements in place with several Fortune 100 companies. Tobi Mac Aro, president of Cataca Resources and CEO/founder of FlitWays, commented, "FlitWays was built with corporate travel needs in mind and is now the ideal platform to schedule and manage their global ground transportation services. We know that businesses and travel providers can accomplish more on FlitWays than compared to what can be achieved on Uber or Lyft." The Company is also pleased to announce that the required audit of FlitWays has been completed, including unaudited statements for the most recent quarterly periods ending March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016. As a result, the Company anticipates completing the acquisition of FlitWays within 10 days. Aro concluded, "Structuring FlitWays as a publicly traded company is a key component of our plan to grow and expand the company into new markets and internationally. With the audit and financial statements now completed, we look forward to closing the transaction very quickly and launching the next phases of our expansion strategy."

FlitWays is travel company based in Los Angeles. It produces both a mobile app and enterprise platform, which can be used to order or plan ground transportation.
History[edit]
FlitWays is based in Los Angeles, launching in 2013 within the Los Angeles market before moving to other American cities,[1] including fifteen by April of 2014.[2] That month the app entered the international market[3] with 84 cities in North America, South America, Asia, and Europe two months later.[4] By 2016 the app was used in around 200 cities,[5] and in 2017 the app became available in Australia, starting with ten additional cities there.[6] The company was founded by Tobi Mac, and originally known as OnCabs.[7][8] It began with $600,000 in seed funding, supplemented with a $1.2 million Series A round of financing in December 2016.[5] It is now traded on the OTC Pink Sheets under the ticker symbol FTWS.[9]
Travel app[edit]
Users use either an online service or mobile app to enter their travel details—pick-up location, time, and destination—and are provided a comparative cost between different travel options, usually taxi, town car, and airport shuttle. Pricing is also reduced if the booking is made enough time in advance,[1][10] through partnerships that FlitWays has through taxi providers.[11] Pre-booking is also available for people integrating their ground travel into their larger travel plans.[12] FlitWays also has partnerships with other travel companies like Megabus and Mozio, whose inventory of options can be ordered through the app.[13] FlitWays is cashless, with all payments being made through the app or online service.[4] The app is free and compatible with both Android and iOS.[2] FlitWays also has an enterprise platform, which is used by corporations including Xerox and Megabus.[5]
