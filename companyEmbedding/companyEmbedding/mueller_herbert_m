David Duvall, Duvall Construction & Remodeling, Inc			  		For approximately the last 45 years I have been a customer of Mueller Roofing Distributors.  It is enough trouble worrying about the weather and labor in addition to having problems with material.  Mueller Roofing Distributors has eliminated that problem for us with the quick deliveries, good fresh stock, and variety of any type of material we need delivered to any location with good equipment.  The office management and work force are always efficient and their prices are always competitive.

Richard C. Bernecker, Bernecker Bros. Roofing & Sheet Metal			  		To remain competitive in the roofing industry, it helps to have a valuable and dependable partner like Mueller Roofing.

Ray Matre, Fasten-Pro Roofing, LLC			  		We have worked with the fine people at Mueller Roofing Distributing for over 50 years. The broad range of products and great service are second to none in the Cincinnati area, these are only two of the reasons we prefer to do business with the people at Mueller.

Jim Eckstein, Jr, CA Eckstein			  		In 1995, I was introduced to Mueller through a builder.  The builder bought supplies through Mueller.  I, at the time, purchased through a Dayton competitor.  I visited the local Mueller and was very impressed with the time I had to wait to get an order placed and loaded.  On average, I saved 15 minutes a trip.  I have been a loyal customer since.  Time is money and Mueller respects my time.

Jim Van Dine, Jim Van Dine, Professional Roof Dr., Ltd			  		Quality Service and gratitude for customer support definitely go hand in hand with all the fine people at Mueller!  The always courteous and efficient help from you staff at the Dayton office has been a huge help for us, not only in the order and delivery phase, but for the help they have given my office staff.

President, Maxim Roofing			  		It has been and will continue to be our pleasure to work with Mueller.  Mueller is committed to provide not only contractors, but our customers as well, with quality products, services, and knowledge.

Byron Kizer, Kizer, Inc			  		Through the years, our relationship has continued to grow and Mueller has never failed to meet or surpass our needs.  It is indeed a refreshing pleasure to deal with such knowledgeable, professional people.  Whether it's sending tuck loads of materials to Florida after a hurricane, or simply across the state line to Indianapolis, your staff is always up to the challenge.  Your people have proven time and again how superior quality and customer service is achieved...on a daily, reliable basis.

Frank			  		Mueller has been a valued commercial and residential material supplier for my grandfather, father and now me. As a member of the Tecta America, the largest roofing contractor in the United States, we have all the major suppliers calling for our business, but Mueller remains at the top of our list because of their knowledgeable sales people, extensive inventory, timely service and competitive pricing.

Jonathan Wolf, The Zero Company			  		Roofing, siding, and windows are a small portion of my business but regardless of my needs my sales rep always treats and services me as if I'm one of his largest customers. It is this kind of service and extra effort that gets Mueller my return business.

"Chaz" Aldridge, Malibu Construction			  		It's nice to have locations on both sides of the Dayton and Northern Cincinnati.  If I need something I'm always close.  I don't have to go back to the shop.  It saves lots of time and resources.

Dave Gibbs, Cotterman & Company			  		Mueller has serviced our company for many years in roofing supplies.  They have always given us excellent service as well as the best price so we can pass the savings on to our customers.

Bill Hoppe, The Enterprise Roofing & Sheet Metal Company			  		I like to provide professional and personal relationships with my customers.  At Mueller, I know that I can send a customer to explore all the choices available in the market and the folks at Mueller will extend the care and support needed to make their roofing experience complete.

Gerry Craven, Craven Roofing			  		Rain-A-Way Gutter Co. Inc has been doing business with Mueller Roofing supply for the past 30 years.  It has been a terrific relationship.  The personnel at Mueller have always been outstanding to work with and even though we have on occasion done business with some of Mueller's competitors we feel that we get the best service and competitive everyday pricing at Mueller.  Our hope is that the relationship we have with Mueller continues for a long time to come.

Darrel Sams, Rain-A-Way			  		My roofer asked me to buy the materials so I came to Lockland store for help. I had the most wonderful service! The person who helped me knew exactly what I needed even though I was clueless. The goods were delivered and even though there was one mistake you guys fixed it without question. This is the best customer service I have seen anywhere in years. Keep up the good work. Thank you for being very helpful! You obviously run a great operation. I don't recall my salesperson's name but it was a woman.

Tom Y, Residential Customer			  		Better selection, competitive prices, good service & courteous!

Lester Grubb, Grubb Consulting

Herbert Müller Rebmann (11 May 1940 – 24 May 1981) was a racing driver from Switzerland. He was born in Reinach and was nicknamed Stumpen-Herbie. Among other successes, he won the Targa Florio twice, in 1966 and 1973, both with Porsche.
Driving a Ferrari 512 in an Interserie race at the Nürburgring, he survived a fiery start collision that ended in the pit lane next to a fire engine. Müller got out of the car and ran towards a fire fighter who put out the flames on his overall.
He died in the 1981 1000 km Nürburgring in his Porsche 908 Turbo, racing with his longtime friend Siegfried Brunn. Before the event, Müller stated that he would retire from motorsports after the end of the race. On lap 17 of the race, Müller crashed while attempting to avoid another driver who had spun in front of him. He collided heavily with an earth bank and then hit a previously retired car, causing a large explosion and fire. He was dead by the time he was removed from the burning car; he had not been wearing his safety belts at the time of the crash, and was killed in the initial impact. The race was stopped after 17 laps and was not completed.
