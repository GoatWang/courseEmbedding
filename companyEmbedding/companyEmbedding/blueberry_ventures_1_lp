 Biena Announces New Investors for Series A Financing 
         










    










 













 











 



















Biena Announces New Investors for Series A Financing
        																																																		
              

          New backers include ESPN's Darren Rovell, Spanx Founder Sara Blakely and Blueberry Ventures

BOSTON, June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Biena Snacks is welcoming a powerful group of new investors to the company.
Investors in this round include ESPN's Darren Rovell, a partner in Tastemaker Capital, who brought an influential group of financers to the table—notably Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx, and Jesse Itzler, co-founder of Marquis Jets and an early investor in Zico Coconut Water.










 







							 		Chocolate lovers everywhere can get their fix and feel good about it with Biena's new line of chocolate-covered chickpeas, which hit shelves later this summer. Biena has submerged its signature Sea Salt chickpeas into delectable chocolate and caramel. The three flavors–dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and salted caramel–are an indulgent, yet healthy snack with 4 grams of protein and only 130 calories per serving.
							  



 

 
 



Additional investors in the round include Blueberry Ventures, Centerman Capital and New Ground Ventures.
"The momentum for plant-based protein snacks is undeniable and the chickpea has come out on top," said Rovell. "Our group feels that there isn't anyone in the category that can touch Biena—its texture and flavor profiles are outstanding. Along with the product itself, the passion and clear direction of Poorvi Patodia and her leadership team really sealed the deal for us."  
Biena grew by 800 percent over the last three years and is on track to more than double its revenue in 2017.  The new funds will be used to support continued distribution growth and large-scale marketing efforts for the brand. 
Since its launch, consumers have responded in spades to the brand's full-flavored taste profiles, clean ingredients and nutritional benefits, making Biena one of the highest velocity healthy snacks on supermarket shelves today. Biena is available in 15,000 locations nationally, including Sprouts, Whole Foods, Safeway and Stop & Shop. The brand also recently launched a co-branded product line with Weight Watchers.
Biena is available in six tempting flavors, including Sea Salt, Rockin' Ranch and Honey Roasted. Each serving of Biena chickpeas has an enviable 5-6 grams of protein and 5-6 grams of fiber, and boasts a calorie count that allows consumers to still smile after polishing off the bag. In addition, Biena chickpeas are naturally gluten-free, non-GMO, kosher and made in a factory that is free of peanuts.
Biena was developed by Patodia when she was pregnant and searching for a healthier way to satisfy her snack cravings. Inspired by a favorite childhood snack, Patodia started experimenting with roasted chickpeas in her own kitchen, developing a unique way to make them light and crispy while maintaining the protein, fiber and nutrients of a whole chickpea. Leveraging her background in developing brands at Johnson & Johnson, Patodia launched Biena in 2012—when the plant-protein snacks trend was still in its infancy.
"I'm thrilled to have our new investors join the Biena family," Patodia said. "Their genuine passion for the brand and our mission to help everyday Americans snack healthier makes us the perfect pair. I couldn't be more excited for this next phase of growth."
With the chickpea emerging as the star of the plant-protein snacking trend, Biena is well positioned to be a market leader. Later this month, at the Fancy Food Show at the Jacob Javits Center in New York City, the company will publicly unveil a new indulgent snack—a line of chocolate and caramel-covered roasted chickpeas (Booth 5476). This new product line will launch in stores nationwide in July. 
About Biena FoodsBiena is a snack food company that specializes in deliciously crunchy and healthy all-natural bean protein snacks. They are available at Whole Foods Markets, Sprouts Farmers Markets, Safeway and New Seasons as well as online at Amazon.com and SnackAisle.com.

When

                    the first school bus is already in the parking lot, unloading 
                    summer campers toward the barn-like farm stand. Shepherded 
                    by counselors, the kids tumble in, select old coffee cans 
                    fixed with string from a large bin, and hang them around their 
                    necks. Then they head back outside and pile on to a low trailer 
                    hooked to a little old orchard tractor for the ride out to 
                    the U-pick fields, squirming and shouting all the way.
                    



SLIDESHOW: 
                        Blueberry 
                        Fields Forever





                    Farm manager and co-owner John Marchese (pronounced 'mar-KAY-zee') 
                    is close at hand, directing traffic and taking evident pride 
                    in the chaotic pleasure of the kids. "If you’re 
                    a U-pick farmer, you have an obligation" to offer a safe, 
                    chemical-free product, he says. "You know there are going 
                    to be kids out there eating in the fields." Mondays are 
                    his slow day, but even so, streams of cars and customers, 
                    trucks and employees swirl around the farm. On weekends they 
                    hook two people-trailers each to two tractors and run them 
                    back and forth to the fields all day. Situated on the edge 
                    of the Pine Barrens, in the western corner of Ocean County, 
                    Emery's is not only the largest organic blueberry grower in 
                    New Jersey, but also, Marchese ventures, "probably the 
                    most successful U-pick blueberry operation in the state." 
                    

                    It's fitting that that conjunction--between U-pick marketing 
                    and organic blueberries--should take root here. When John's 
                    parents, Michael and Susan Marchese, purchased this farm 5 
                    years ago and converted it to organic, they kept the name 
                    Emery's in honor of the original owner, Butch Emery, who "had 
                    a reputation for being the first person to hook a wagon on 
                    to a tractor and bring people out into his fields." "People 
                    thought he was crazy," John explains, "but then 
                    they saw it was a great idea." 
                    




Over the past three years, organic 
                        blueberries have been selling at between $18 and $28 a 
                        72-oz flat, while conventional berry prices have ranged 
                        from $8 to $16 a flat. U-pickers at Emery's pay $1.75/lb 
                        for their organic berries, versus around 90¢/lb for 
                        conventional u-pick blueberries nearby.






                  The blueberry itself, moreover, was first domesticated less 
                  than 15 miles from here by a woman John refers to simply as 
                  "Elizabeth.” That’s Elizabeth Coleman White 
                  (1871-1954), daughter of a prominent cranberry grower and, in 
                  the 1910s, the first person to bring wild blueberries out of 
                  the woods and develop them into commercial varieties. The high-bush 
                  blueberry's proximity to its wild origins gives it good natural 
                  vigor and pest resistance, making it an excellent crop for organic 
                  production. 
                  Today, the Marcheses are upholding that twin tradition by 
                    running a profitable family farm business and at the same 
                    time working closely with Rutgers Cooperative Extension to 
                    advance the potential of organics within the Mid-Atlantic's 
                    blueberry industry. In New Jersey, high-bush blueberries are 
                    a $40 million market, with 7,500 acres in production, only 
                    around 2 percent of which are certified organic.

                    That demand exceeds supply is indicated by the fact over the 
                    past three years, organic blueberries have been selling at 
                    between $18 and $28 a 72-oz flat, while conventional berry 
                    prices have ranged from $8 to $16 a flat. U-pickers at Emery's 
                    pay $1.75/lb for their organic berries, versus around 90¢/lb 
                    for conventional U-pick blueberries nearby. (A pound of blueberries 
                    is around 3/4 of a pint.) Given those kinds of incentives, 
                    it's not surprising that interest is growing: a recent Twilight 
                    Meeting at Emery's, organized by Monmouth County Extension 
                    Agent Bill Sciarappa to highlight the on-farm research he 
                    has been conducting there, drew more than 100 people. 
Picking up where his dad left off: creating the largest 
                    blueberry farm in the state

                    The last 5 years have offered a steep learning curve to the 
                    Marcheses themselves. Michael and Susan Marchese ran a small, 
                    diversified organic vegetable farm over near the shore for 
                    many years, but blueberries were a new crop for them. "My 
                    dad brought me over to have a look at this place when he was 
                    thinking about buying it," John recalls. "The farmstand 
                    was run down, the kitchens were a mess, the fields were overgrown--it 
                    had been on the market for two years." 

                    In 2001, after just three seasons of work on the new property, 
                    Mike was diagnosed with a type of liver cancer (the family 
                    believes it was caused by exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam) 
                    and died within a few months. John, who had been earning six 
                    figures working for a surgical supply company and whose agricultural 
                    background consisted of growing up on his parents' farm, stepped 
                    into the breach. Last season he tried splitting his time between 
                    his old job and Emery's, but now, aged 32, he's fully committed 
                    to life as a berry farmer. “I’m glad I’ve 
                    got some money saved,” he says wryly, but he has no 
                    regrets about the career change.

                    John's mother Susan Marchese retains an equal role in the 
                    business, and other family members--aunts, uncles, and cousins--also 
                    help out. "John handles the growing, and I handle the 
                    store," says Susan. Once a quarter or so, mother and 
                    son sit down to look at the books and make decisions about 
                    changes and improvements. For the moment, they have 29 acres 
                    of blueberries picking from mid-June to early August, 1 1/2 
                    acres of raspberries from early September to first frost, 
                    and 2 acres of pumpkins from mid-September to Halloween. The 
                    farm stand stays open 7 days a week, 9 to 5, from late March 
                    to late December, selling pies, muffins, syrups, jams, and 
                    chutneys. 
The Marcheses report that when they converted Emery's to 
                    organic, the customer base both shifted and increased. As 
                    John puts it, “we lost 20 percent of the business and picked 
                    up 40 percent.” 
Wholesale rounds out their organic berry business

                    In addition to the U-pick and retail sales, the Marcheses' 
                    berries are wholesaled through Albert's Organics and Four 
                    Seasons, ultimately traveling to Boston, Philadelphia, and 
                    Washington D.C. The berries are easily identified by the "Emery's 
                    Berry Farm" label stuck to every package. John maintains 
                    separate fields at the back of the farm for his pre-picked 
                    or 'shipping' berries, but says that the balance between U-pick 
                    and shipping sales varies--this year, he estimates, they’re 
                    running about 70 percent U-pick and 30 percent shipping. 
                    




 




Summer 
                              help : High schoolers (from left to right): 
                              Matt, RJ, Greg, Paul, and Ryan, earn extra cash 
                              sorting out the bad berries. 





One of the Marcheses' major early investments was in packing 
                    equipment that enables them to process 80 flats an hour and 
                    deliver clean, top-quality pints. Berries are tipped from 
                    harvesting flats onto a conveyor belt, where four or five 
                    workers cull green or damaged fruit; the berries are then 
                    funneled into plastic clam-shells which are automatically 
                    separated, filled, and shut. 

                    The farm's fields are laid out in small blocks, 1/4 acre to 
                    2 or more acres in size, with rows 10 ft apart and bushes 
                    3 ft apart in the rows. Varieties include Berkeley, Duke, 
                    and Weymouth; John's current favorite is Blue Crop, which 
                    is disease resistant and has a strongly upright growth habit. 
                    That makes it well suited to the use of the Weed Badger, a 
                    PTO-driven, hydraulic-controlled cultivator with a heavy arm 
                    that bends around the right hand side of the tractor and can 
                    be maneuvered in and out to cultivate between the plants in 
                    the row. Although the rows are looking a little weedy at the 
                    moment--in this year's soggy spring they were pumping standing 
                    water out of the fields instead of cultivating--John shrugs 
                    with the confidence of a farmer who's got his weed control 
                    system down. "Weeds are an inconvenience, not a problem," 
                    he says. "I'll get them cleaned out again when we're 
                    through picking."
Working on a no-till system to cut labor and energy




 

The 
                              no-till, low-mow system: Marchese, with 
                              Bill Sciarappa and SARE, hopes to develop a system 
                              that will allow his mower to enter semi-retirement. 
                            




Even so, Marchese is working with Bill Sciarappa to develop 
                    a no-till system to reduce the number of trips through the 
                    fields. The idea is to combine low-growing covers like fescue 
                    and buffalo grass in the alleys with heavy mulching in the 
                    rows, so that in theory, as John explains, "I should 
                    be able to mow [the alleys] twice a year and be done with 
                    it." 
Funded in part by a Sustainable Agriculture Research and 
                    Education (SARE) grant, the trials are evaluating two different 
                    establishment methods and eight different mulching treatments 
                    including coffee grounds, tea leaves, cocoa bean hulls, pine 
                    bark chips, hardwood chips, and landscape fabric. 

                    Sciarappa also added a pest control dimension to the study, 
                    examining ten different organic-approved materials including 
                    compost tea, hydrogen peroxide, sulfur, pyrethrum, neem, and 
                    spinosad. Finally, the collaborators are trying to figure 
                    out a way to use drip irrigation, instead of overhead sprinklers, 
                    without interfering with the use of the Weed Badger.





The Marcheses report that when they 
                        converted Emery's to organic, the customer base both shifted 
                        and increased. As John puts it, “we lost 20% of 
                        the business and picked up 40%.”






Marchese is keen to perfect his establishment procedure, 
                    since some of the blueberry bushes on the farm are as many 
                    as 40 years old, and he is gradually renovating field by field. 
                    When putting in a new block, Marchese 'mulches' below the 
                    soil level as well as above it, laying down 20 inches of composted 
                    hardwood chips in the plant-row trenches. He creates the roughly 
                    18-by-18-inch opening with a subsoiler or "middlebuster" 
                    blade. The mulch helps create a pH of 4.8 or 4.9 and organic 
                    matter content of 30-35 percent in the plants' primary root 
                    zone. 
For fertility, Marchese side-dresses using a Vicon dog-tail 
                    spreader and a granular, processed poultry manure product 
                    he gets from Frank Perdue in Delaware. 
“Last year I bought 26 tons at $80 a ton,” John 
                    explains. "It’s 4-3-3, and it's supposed to be 
                    put down post-bloom.” Because it's a composted and processed 
                    product, its application is not restricted by pre-harvest 
                    date, but John likes to get it on as early as possible. 
Getting help from his friends, both organic and conventional

                    Blueberry yields at Emery’s run between 2000-3000 lbs/acre--similar 
                    to what an average conventional grower might get, says Marchese, 
                    albeit considerably less than the best conventional yields, 
                    which can run as high as 6000-8000 lbs/acre. John readily 
                    admits he has more to learn about growing berries. "I'm 
                    still pretty new at this. For now I’m comfortable losing 
                    part of the crop to disease. Take this year. I probably lost 
                    about 4 percent to cherry fruit worm--I could have sprayed Bt for 
                    that, but I didn't--4 percent to mummyberry, 10 percent to poor pollination, 
                    10 percent to blight." 
On the other hand, John points out, conventional growers 
                    in the area probably suffered more from poor pollination this 
                    year because of the diversity of pollinators the organic farm 
                    supports. "Along the wood line I got close to 100 percent fruit 
                    set," he marvels. "There were just tons of bumblebees 
                    out there this spring, when the honeybees were in the hives 
                    because it was too cold.” 

                    John compares notes regularly with other organic blueberry 
                    growers in the region, but credits Bobby Galletta of Atlantic 
                    Blueberry Company—based in Hammonton, and one of the 
                    largest and oldest blueberry farms in the state—with 
                    nurturing him as a grower, especially after Mike Marchese 
                    passed away. "Bobby is a great guy," says John, 
                    "and he’s the best blueberry grower in the country. 
                    He farms very conservatively; his fields have very high organic 
                    matter and he uses an absolute minimum of herbicides and pesticides." 
                  
Why U-Pick? Because it’s really cool.






 




Equipment 
                              room : U-pickers stop a the farmstand to 
                              pick up their buckets and hitch a ride to the fields. 
                            





Perhaps with the large-scale, commercial Atlantic Blueberry 
                    farms in mind, John cautions that operating a U-pick farm 
                    has a number of disadvantages: You open yourself up to crop 
                    wastage, to liability, to inspection and criticism. So why 
                    do they do it?
 He surveys the fields full of customers with satisfaction. 
                    “Because it’s really cool. Because everyday you 
                    get to come out here and see some three year-old kid with 
                    blueberry juice smeared all over him and a big smile on his 
                    face, and you know he’s probably coming from some condo 
                    or townhouse somewhere and this might be his first visit to 
                    a farm ever. That’s why."

Berries do a body good

Now even more great reasons to enjoy blueberries! This little fruit softens dry skin, boosts your brain, and may even prevent cancer.

Skin reviver

Soften up with this scrub from The Cliff House Resort and Spa in Ogunquit, Maine: Combine 2 cups brown sugar, 2 teaspoons puréed blueberries, and 3 tablespoons lemon juice. Blueberry’s antioxidants soften skin, lemon juice brightens, and sugar exfoliates.

Bladder aid

Blueberries, like cranberries, contain compounds that prevent bacteria from adhering to bladder walls, which helps ward off urinary-tract infections (UTI’s), according to a Rutgers University study. If you get UTI’s, toss a handful of blueberries into your a.m. smoothie.

Cancer blocker

Blueberries’ anthocyaninswhich give them their blue hueattack cancer-causing free radicals and can even block the growth of tumor cells, a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign study found. Eating just a half-cup a day (like in a slice of pie!) is all you need.

Brain food

To work smarter, pack dried-blueberry trail mix for a snack. A study from the University of Reading and the Peninsula Medical School in England suggests that blueberries reverse age-related memory loss, thanks to its abundance of antioxidants called flavonoids.
