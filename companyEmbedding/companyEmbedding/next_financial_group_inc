We Are More Than Just Coworkers
Our employees feel more like family than coworkers due to the culture we have worked so hard to build and maintain throughout the years. 
Whether we are playing sports together after work, chatting over coffee in the morning or sharing our annual Thanksgiving feast, there is never a dull moment. 
We are proud to offer our employees valuable growth opportunities to help them form and achieve career goals. Explore career opportunities currently available.
Our Industry
We are a family of NEXTonians who come from all industry backgrounds
Not all of our employees came from a background in financial services, but grew to understand the business overtime through training, exposure and interaction with our Representatives. Even if you are unsure what an independent broker-dealer is or what a financial advisor does, our Home Office team is here to help you every step of the way.
Paid Time Off (PTO) is dependent on the amount of time an employee has been with the company and how many hours they work. Each employee begins with 15 vacation days a year, and this number increases the longer they stay at NEXT. Sick days are included in PTO time.
We also invite all employees to participate in company-wide sporting events after hours, such as softball, kickball and bowling, in order to build relationships outside of the office.
Defining The Basics
Broker-dealer: A broker-dealer is a person or firm that buys and sells securities either as a broker or a dealer, depending on the transaction. Broker-dealers facilitate trades and act as liaisons between regulatory bodies and financial professionals. 
Regulators: The two primary regulatory bodies for the financial services industry are the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (âFINRAâ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ). FINRA is charged with overseeing business between brokers, dealers and the investing public. The SEC monitors securities markets in order to protect investors.
To find out more about NEXT and our industry, we invite you to explore our website and read about the various departments and their available resources. To browse career opportunities at NEXT, visit our open positions page.

Letter from the President

										There is nothing more important to NEXT Financial Group, Inc. (âNEXTâ) than helping our Representatives build business their own way.										
					
				






A Bold History



 

Read More

										
										NEXT Financial Group, Inc. ("NEXT") was created when a group of fiercely independent investment representatives grew tired of the repeated mergers and declining service from their broker-dealers.

										A majority of our board members are NEXT Representatives, shareholders and division managers. Their experience as NEXT advisors dictate their decisions and assist in creating a broker-dealer that is truly rep-focused.

We Are More Than Just Coworkers
Our employees feel more like family than coworkers due to the culture we have worked so hard to build and maintain throughout the years. 
Whether we are playing sports together after work, chatting over coffee in the morning or sharing our annual Thanksgiving feast, there is never a dull moment. 
We are proud to offer our employees valuable growth opportunities to help them form and achieve career goals. Explore career opportunities currently available.
Our Industry
We are a family of NEXTonians who come from all industry backgrounds
Not all of our employees came from a background in financial services, but grew to understand the business overtime through training, exposure and interaction with our Representatives. Even if you are unsure what an independent broker-dealer is or what a financial advisor does, our Home Office team is here to help you every step of the way.
Paid Time Off (PTO) is dependent on the amount of time an employee has been with the company and how many hours they work. Each employee begins with 15 vacation days a year, and this number increases the longer they stay at NEXT. Sick days are included in PTO time.
We also invite all employees to participate in company-wide sporting events after hours, such as softball, kickball and bowling, in order to build relationships outside of the office.
Defining The Basics
Broker-dealer: A broker-dealer is a person or firm that buys and sells securities either as a broker or a dealer, depending on the transaction. Broker-dealers facilitate trades and act as liaisons between regulatory bodies and financial professionals. 
Regulators: The two primary regulatory bodies for the financial services industry are the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (âFINRAâ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (âSECâ). FINRA is charged with overseeing business between brokers, dealers and the investing public. The SEC monitors securities markets in order to protect investors.

NEXT Financial Group Inc. Charged with Supervisory Failures in Connection with Structured Investment Products


                    Posted August 10, 2014 by Alan Rosca

NEXT Financial Group Inc., a general securities broker-dealer headquartered in Houston, Texas, had a deficient supervisory system and written procedures related to structured products it offered and sold to its customers, according to charges by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.
The Peiffer Rosca law firmâs securities practice attorneys Alan Rosca and Joe Peiffer are investigating the matter.
NEXT Financial Group Inc. Has Had Previous Disciplinary Occurrences
NEXT retains approximately 900 registered persons and 590 registered branch locations and has been a FINRA registered member since June of 1999, according to a FINRA report.
NEXT retains a relevant FINRA disciplinary history, as specified in a FINRA report. In May of 2008, NEXT was censured and fined $10,000 in connection with late U4/U5 form and Rule 3070 filings. In November of 2010, NEXT was fined and censured $400,000 and had to pay $103,179.84 as well as interest in restitution to customers for allegedly failing to maintain an adequate system for reviewing excessive trading of its registered representativesâ transactions among other violations. In November of 2011, NEXT agreed to pay a $50,000 fine and $2 million in restitution for alleged suitability and supervisory violations.
NEXT Financial Inc. Violates Several FINRA Rules, According to the Regulators
NEXT was accused of being late in filing the necessary FINRA U4 and U5 forms, which disclose customer complaints, judgments, and/or liens, in a timely and accurate manner 22 separate times, as stated in a FINRA report. The periods of tardiness ranged from two weeks to over two years.
NEXT allegedly allowed its former General Counsel to supervise the firmâs Chief Compliance Officer of the Compliance Department without the required principal registration.
Between March of 2009 to August of 2012, NEXT offered and sold various structured products to retail customers while missing an established supervisory system devised to identify and preclude the unsuitable sales of such products. Their written procedures failed to provide adequate guidance on supervision or suitability regarding structured products and did not have a formal training program in place. All of these alleged actions of NEXT were in clear violation of different FINRA rules, as per a FINRA report.
Investor Right Attorneys Investigating NEXT Financial Group Inc.âs Alleged Misconduct
The Peiffer Rosca attorneys often represent investors who lose money as a result of Ponzi schemes, investment fraud, or stockbroker misconduct. They are currently investigating the possibility of assisting investors with the recovery of any losses they may have suffered in connection with NEXT Financial Group Inc. structured products. They take most cases of this type on a contingency fee basis and advance the case costs, and only get paid for their fees and costs out of money they recover for their clients.
Investors who believe they lost money as a result of investments in structure products or investment-related misconduct may contact the securities lawyers at Peiffer Rosca, Alan Rosca or Joe Peiffer, for a free, no-obligation evaluation of their recovery options, at 888-998-0520.
 Alan Rosca (1163 Posts)Alan is a securities lawyer. He also teaches Securities Regulation at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law. He focuses his legal practice on complex commercial and financial litigation and arbitration, particularly in the areas of securities and investment fraud. His office is in Cleveland, Ohio.
