Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Inflation Protected Bond Fund among 
202,
202,
172
and 
113
Inflation-Protected Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

				Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. 
Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			



2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

				This yield has not been adjusted for inflation. Because inflation fluctuates, it cannot be projected into the future precisely enough to be included in the yield calculation.   
			

3
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

Many of our mutual funds earn Morningstar’s highest ratings
Morningstar 4- and 5-Star Rated Funds







Because of our disciplined approach to investing, Morningstar, a leader in independent investment research, recognizes many of our mutual funds with its highest ratings in the funds' respective categories.

Over 70 of our funds have earned 4- or 5-star Overall Morningstar Ratings as of 6/30/17.*

Morningstar uses a 5-star system to rate mutual funds based on their risk-adjusted returns. Five stars is the highest while one star is the lowest rating. Only the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) are awarded Morningstar's 4- or 5-star rating. By comparison, as of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor Class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.​ Past performance cannot guarantee future results.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.




2. 
As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Special Risks:  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.


5. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

Performance data quoted represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. The investment return and
principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investors shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns do not
consider capital gains or income taxes on an individuals investment. Fund returns include changes in share price and reinvested distributions. 
Shares of Oppenheimer Master Inflation Protected Securities Fund, LLC are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public
offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act), as amended. Investments in the Fund may only be made by certain accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation
D under the Securities Act, including other investment companies. This report does not constitute an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, any security within the meaning of the Securities Act.

Fund Performance Discussion 
The Fund produced a total return of 4.55% over the reporting period, compared to its benchmark, the Barclays U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
(TIPS) Index (the Index), which returned 4.83% during the same period. The Funds underperformance relative to the Index was largely the result of fees, as Index performance includes reinvestment of income, but does not
reflect transaction costs, fees, expenses or taxes.  The Fund invests primarily in TIPS, which consisted of roughly 96% of the Funds investments at period
end. The performance of TIPS is closely correlated to the expected U.S. inflation rates. Inflation continued to be tame as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) annual inflation rate was 0.7% before seasonal adjustment for the one-year period
ended January 31, 2015, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics at period end.  The Fund also had a small allocation to mortgage-backed
obligations and asset backed securities, which consisted of roughly 2% of the Funds investments at period end. These investments produced slight positive performance for the Fund during the reporting period. 
The Funds performance is compared to the performance of the Barclays U.S. TIPS Index, which includes all publicly issued, U.S. Treasury inflation-protected
securities that have at least one year remaining to maturity, are rated investment grade, and have $25 million or more of outstanding face value. The Index is unmanaged and cannot be purchased directly by investors. While index comparisons may be
useful to provide a benchmark for the Funds performance, it must be noted that the Funds investments are not limited to the investments comprising the indices. Index

performance includes reinvestment of income, but does not reflect transaction costs, fees, expenses or taxes. Index performance is shown for illustrative purposes only as a benchmark for the
Funds performance, and does not predict or depict performance of the Fund. The Funds performance reflects the effects of the Funds business and operating expenses.

 The percentages above are based on the market value of the Funds securities as of January 30, 2015, and are subject to change.
Except for certain securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign, all securities have been rated by at least one Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO), such as Standard & Poors
(S&P). For securities rated only by an NRSRO other than S&P, OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (the Sub-Adviser) converts that rating to the equivalent S&P rating. If two or more NRSROs have assigned a rating to a security,
the highest S&P equivalent rating is used. Unrated securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign sovereign are assigned a credit rating equal to the highest NRSRO rating assigned to that foreign sovereign. For securities not rated by an NRSRO,
the Sub-Adviser uses its own credit analysis to assign ratings in categories similar to those of S&P. The use of similar categories is not an indication that the Sub-Advisers credit analysis process is consistent or comparable with any
NRSROs process were that NRSRO to rate the same security. Fund assets invested in Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund are assigned that funds S&P rating, which is currently AAA. For the purposes of this table,
investment-grade securities are securities rated within the NRSROs four highest rating categories (AAA, AA, A and BBB). Unrated securities do not necessarily indicate low credit quality, and may or may not be the equivalent of
investment-grade. Please consult the Funds prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for further information.

Funds fiscal year. See Note 2 of the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements.

Fund Expenses 
Fund Expenses. As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, which may include sales charges (loads) on purchase
payments, contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and service fees; and other Fund expenses. These examples are intended to help you understand your ongoing costs (in
dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  The examples are based on an investment of
$1,000.00 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire 6-month period ended January 30, 2015. 
Actual Expenses. The first section of the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this section
for the class of shares you hold, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expense that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600.00 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.60), then
multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During 6 Months Ended January 30, 2015 to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period. 
Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes. The second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses
based on the Funds actual expense ratio for each class of shares, and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year for each class before expenses, which is not the Funds actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may
not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example for the
class of shares you hold with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.  Please note that the expenses shown in the
table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as front-end or contingent deferred sales charges (loads). Therefore, the hypothetical section of the table is useful in comparing
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

 Expenses are equal to the Funds annualized expense ratio for that class, multiplied by the average account value over the period,
multiplied by 183/365 (to reflect the one-half year period). Those annualized expense ratios, excluding indirect expenses from affiliated funds, based on the 6-month period ended January 30, 2015 are as follows: 
 




Expense Ratio

 0.44%        
 The expense ratio reflects voluntary and/or contractual waivers and/or reimbursements of expenses by the Funds Manager. Some of
these undertakings may be modified or terminated at any time, as indicated in the Funds prospectus. The Financial Highlights table in the Funds financial statements, included in this report, also show the gross expense
ratio, without such waivers or reimbursements and reduction to custodian expenses, if applicable.

 Footnotes to Statement of Investments 
*January 30, 2015 represents the last business day of the Funds reporting period. See Note 2 of the accompanying Notes. 
1. Represents securities sold under Rule 144A, which are exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. These securities have been
determined to be liquid under guidelines established by the Board of Directors. These securities amount to $444,574 or 0.26% of the Funds net assets as of January 30, 2015. 
2. Represents the current interest rate for a variable or increasing rate security. 
3. Interest-Only Strips represent the right to receive the monthly interest payments on an underlying pool of mortgage loans. These securities typically decline in
price as interest rates decline. Most other fixed income securities increase in price when interest rates decline. The principal amount of the underlying pool represents the notional amount on which current interest is calculated. The price of these
securities is typically more sensitive to changes in prepayment rates than traditional mortgage-backed securities (for example, GNMA pass-throughs). Interest rates disclosed represent current yields based upon the current cost basis and estimated
timing and amount of future cash flows. These securities amount to $241,566 or 0.14% of the Funds net assets as of January 30, 2015.  4. Denotes an
inflation-indexed security: coupon or principal are indexed to a consumer price index.  5. Is or was an affiliate, as defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended, at or during the period ended January 30, 2015, by virtue of the Fund owning at least 5% of the voting securities of the issuer or as a result of the Fund and the issuer having the same investment adviser. Transactions during
the period in which the issuer was an affiliate are as follows:

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS January 30, 2015 
   
1. Organization  Oppenheimer Master Inflation Protected Securities Fund, LLC
(the Fund) is organized as a Delaware limited liability company and registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act), as amended, as a diversified, open-end management investment company. The Funds
investment objective is to seek total return. The Funds investment adviser is OFI Global Asset Management, Inc. (OFI Global or the Manager), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (OFI or the
Sub-Adviser). The Manager has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with OFI. As of January 30, 2015, approximately 100% of the shares of the Fund were owned by the Manager, other funds advised or sub-advised by the Manager or an
affiliate of the Manager.      Shares of the Fund are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public
offering within the meaning of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Investments in the Fund may only be made by certain accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation
D under the Securities Act, including other investment companies. The Fund currently offers one class of shares.      For federal income tax
purposes, the Fund qualifies as a partnership, and each investor in the Fund is treated as the owner of its proportionate share of the net assets, income, expenses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses of the Fund. Accordingly, as a
pass-through entity, the Fund pays no dividends or capital gain distributions.      The following is a summary of significant
accounting policies consistently followed by the Fund.     
2. Significant Accounting Policies  Security Valuation. All investments
in securities are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3.  Fiscal Year End. The last day of the Funds fiscal year was the last
day the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading. The Funds financial statements have been presented through that date to maintain consistency with the Funds net asset value calculations used for shareholder transactions. 
Investment Income. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or upon ex-dividend notification in the case of certain foreign dividends where the
ex-dividend date may have passed. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Discount and premium, which are included
in interest income on the Statement of Operations, are amortized or accreted daily.  Custodian Fees. Custodian fees and expenses in the Statement
of Operations may include interest expense incurred by the Fund on any cash overdrafts of its custodian account during the period. Such cash overdrafts may result from the effects of failed trades in portfolio securities and from cash outflows
resulting from unanticipated shareholder redemption activity. The Fund pays interest to its custodian on such cash overdraft at a rate equal to the 1 Month LIBOR Rate plus 2.00%. The Reduction to custodian expenses line item, if 
 
16        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


   
  2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 
applicable, represents earnings on cash balances maintained by the Fund during the period. Such interest expense and other custodian fees may be paid with these
earnings.  Security Transactions. Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the
basis of identified cost. Indemnifications. The Funds organizational documents provide current and former Directors and officers with a limited
indemnification against liabilities arising in connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications. The Funds maximum
exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote. 
Federal Taxes. The Fund, as an entity, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Fund will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
partnership, and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Therefore, a tax provision is not required. Each shareholder is required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to take into account, in its taxable year with which (or within which a
taxable year of the Fund ends), its distributive share of all items of Fund income, gains, losses, and deductions for such taxable year of the Fund. A shareholder must take such items into account even if the Fund does not distribute cash or
other property to such shareholder during its taxable year.      Although the Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes, it is
intended that the Funds assets, income and distributions will be managed in such a way that investment in the Fund would not cause an investor that is a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code (RIC) to fail that
qualification.  Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   
  3. Securities Valuation 
The Fund calculates the net asset value of its shares as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange), normally 4:00 P.M. Eastern time, on each
day the Exchange is open for trading.      The Funds Board has adopted procedures for the valuation of the Funds securities and has
delegated the day-to-day responsibility for valuation determinations under those procedures to the Manager. The Manager has established a Valuation Committee which is responsible for determining a fair valuation for any security for
which market quotations are not readily available. The Valuation Committees fair valuation determinations are subject to review, 
 
17        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Continued 
   
3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  approval and ratification by the
Funds Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting covering the calendar quarter in which the fair valuation was determined.  Valuation Methods and Inputs
 Securities are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices, when available, as supplied primarily by third party pricing services or dealers. 
    The following methodologies are used to determine the market value or the fair value of the types of securities described below: 
    Securities traded on a registered U.S. securities exchange (including exchange-traded derivatives other than futures and futures options) are
valued based on the last sale price of the security reported on the principal exchange on which it is traded, prior to the time when the Funds assets are valued. In the absence of a sale, the security is valued at the last sale price on the
prior trading day, if it is within the spread of the current days closing bid and asked prices, and if not, at the current days closing bid price. A security of a foreign issuer traded on a foreign exchange, but
not listed on a registered U.S. securities exchange, is valued based on the last sale price on the principal exchange on which the security is traded, as identified by the third party pricing service used by the Manager, prior to the time when the
Funds assets are valued. If the last sale price is unavailable, the security is valued at the most recent official closing price on the principal exchange on which it is traded. If the last sales price or official closing price for a foreign
security is not available, the security is valued at the mean between the bid and asked price per the exchange or, if not available from the exchange, obtained from two dealers. If bid and asked prices are not available from either the exchange or
two dealers, the security is valued by using one of the following methodologies (listed in order of priority): (1) using a bid from the exchange, (2) the mean between the bid and asked price as provided by a single dealer, or (3) a
bid from a single dealer.      Shares of a registered investment company that are not traded on an exchange are valued at that investment
companys net asset value per share.      Corporate and government debt securities (of U.S. or foreign issuers) and municipal debt
securities, event-linked bonds, loans, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices utilizing evaluated prices obtained
from third party pricing services or broker-dealers who may use matrix pricing methods to determine the evaluated prices.      Short-term money
market type debt securities with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at cost adjusted by the amortization of discount or premium to maturity (amortized cost), which approximates market value. Short-term debt securities with a
remaining maturity in excess of sixty days are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices utilizing evaluated prices obtained from third party pricing services or broker-dealers. 
    Futures contracts and futures options traded on a commodities or futures exchange will be valued at the final settlement price or official
closing price on the principal exchange as reported by such principal exchange at its trading session ending at, or most recently prior to, the time when the Funds assets are valued. 
 
18        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


   
   
3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  A description of the standard inputs that
may generally be considered by the third party pricing vendors in determining their evaluated prices is provided below. 






Security Type
  
Standard inputs generally considered by third-party pricingvendors

 Corporate debt, government debt, municipal, mortgage-backed and
asset- backed securities
  
Reported trade data, broker-dealer price quotations, benchmark yields, issuer spreads on comparable securities, the credit quality, yield, maturity, and other appropriate factors.

 Loans
  
Information obtained from market participants regarding reported trade data and broker-dealer price quotations.

 Event-linked bonds
  
Information obtained from market participants regarding reported trade data and broker-dealer price quotations.
 If a market value or price cannot be determined for a security using the methodologies described above, or if, in the good
faith opinion of the Manager, the market value or price obtained does not constitute a readily available market quotation, or a significant event has occurred that would materially affect the value of the security the security is
fair valued either (i) by a standardized fair valuation methodology applicable to the security type or the significant event as previously approved by the Valuation Committee and the Funds Board or (ii) as determined in good faith by
the Managers Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee considers all relevant facts that are reasonably available, through either public information or information available to the Manager, when determining the fair value of a security.
Fair value determinations by the Manager are subject to review, approval and ratification by the Funds Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting covering the calendar quarter in which the fair valuation was determined. Those fair valuation
standardized methodologies include, but are not limited to, valuing securities at the last sale price or initially at cost and subsequently adjusting the value based on: changes in company specific fundamentals, changes in an appropriate securities
index, or changes in the value of similar securities which may be further adjusted for any discounts related to security-specific resale restrictions. When possible, such methodologies use observable market inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices of
similar securities, observable interest rates, currency rates and yield curves. The methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities nor can it be assured that the
Fund can obtain the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the security.      To assess the continuing appropriateness of security
valuations, the Manager, or its third party service provider who is subject to oversight by the Manager, regularly compares prior day prices, prices on comparable securities, and sale prices to the current day prices and challenges those prices
exceeding certain tolerance levels with the third party pricing service or broker source. For those securities valued by fair valuations, whether through a standardized fair valuation methodology or a fair valuation determination, the Valuation
Committee reviews and affirms the reasonableness of the valuations based on such methodologies and fair valuation determinations on a regular basis after considering all relevant information that is reasonably available.

3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  Classifications 
Each investment asset or liability of the Fund is assigned a level at measurement date based on the significance and source of the inputs to its valuation. Various data
inputs are used in determining the value of each of the Funds investments as of the reporting period end. These data inputs are categorized in the following hierarchy under applicable financial accounting standards: 
1) Level 1-unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (including securities actively traded on a securities
exchange)  2) Level 2-inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as unadjusted quoted prices for
similar assets and market corroborated inputs such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.)  3) Level 3-significant unobservable
inputs (including the Managers own judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability).  The inputs used for
valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities.  The table below categorizes amounts that are
included in the Funds Statement of Assets and Liabilities as of January 30, 2015 based on valuation input level:

  4. Investments and Risks 
Investment in Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund. The Fund is permitted to invest daily available cash balances in an affiliated money market fund. The
Fund may invest the available cash in Class E shares of Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund (IMMF) to seek current income while preserving liquidity or for defensive purposes. IMMF is a registered open-end management investment
company, regulated as a money market fund under the 1940 Act. The Manager is the investment adviser of IMMF, and the Sub-Adviser provides investment and related advisory services to IMMF. When applicable, the Funds investment in
IMMF is included in the Statement of Investments. Shares of IMMF are valued at their net asset value per share. As a shareholder, the Fund is subject to its proportional share of IMMFs Class E expenses, including its management fee. The
Manager will waive fees and/or reimburse Fund expenses in an amount equal to the indirect management fees incurred through the Funds investment in IMMF. 
Inflation-Indexed Debt Securities. Inflation-indexed debt securities are fixed income securities that are structured to seek to provide protection against
inflation. The value of the bonds principal or the interest rate paid on the bond is adjusted to track changes in a stated inflation measure. With respect to inflation-indexed bonds whose principal is adjusted with inflation, if the index
measuring inflation falls, the principal value of the inflation-indexed bonds will be adjusted downward, and consequently the interest payable on these securities (calculated with respect to smaller principal amounts) will be reduced. If the index
measuring inflation rises, both the principal value and the interest payable (calculated with respect to a larger principal amount) will increase. With respect to inflation-indexed bonds whose interest rate is adjusted with inflation, instead of
adjusting the bonds principal amount, the inflation adjustment is reflected in the coupon payment. Because of this inflation adjustment feature, inflation-protected bonds typically have lower yields than conventional fixed-rate bonds with
similar maturities. As of January 30, 2015, securities with an aggregate market value of $163,012,018, representing 95.3% of the Funds net assets were comprised of inflation-indexed debt securities. 
Concentration Risk. Focusing on one type of investment, inflation-indexed bonds, rather than a broad spectrum of investments, makes the Funds share price
particularly sensitive to market, economic and other events that may affect this investment type. The Funds investment in inflation-indexed bonds may be speculative and subject to greater price volatility than other types of investments. 
   
5. Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments  The Funds
investment objective not only permits the Fund to purchase investment securities, it also allows the Fund to enter into various types of derivatives contracts, including, but not limited to, futures contracts, forward currency exchange contracts,
credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, variance swaps and purchased and written options. In doing so, the Fund will employ strategies in differing combinations to permit it to increase, decrease, or change the level or types
of exposure to market risk factors. These instruments may allow the Fund to pursue its objectives more quickly and efficiently than if it were to

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Continued 
   
5. Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments (Continued)  make
direct purchases or sales of securities capable of effecting a similar response to market factors. Such contracts may be entered into through a bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, or through a securities or futures exchange and
cleared through a clearinghouse.  Market Risk Factors. In accordance with its investment objectives, the Fund may use derivatives to increase or decrease its
exposure to one or more of the following market risk factors:  Commodity Risk. Commodity risk relates to the change in value of commodities or
commodity indexes as they relate to increases or decreases in the commodities market. Commodities are physical assets that have tangible properties. Examples of these types of assets are crude oil, heating oil, metals, livestock, and agricultural
products.   Credit Risk. Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer to meet interest and principal payments, or both, as
they come due. In general, lower-grade, higher-yield bonds are subject to credit risk to a greater extent than lower-yield, higher-quality bonds. 
Equity Risk. Equity risk relates to the change in value of equity securities as they relate to increases or decreases in the general market. 
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. Foreign exchange rate risk relates to the change in the U.S. dollar value of a security held that is denominated in a
foreign currency. The U.S. dollar value of a foreign currency denominated security will decrease as the dollar appreciates against the currency, while the U.S. dollar value will increase as the dollar depreciates against the currency. 
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the fluctuations in value of fixed-income securities resulting from the inverse relationship
between price and yield. For example, an increase in general interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of already issued fixed-income investments, and a decline in general interest rates will tend to increase their value. In addition, debt
securities with longer maturities, which tend to have higher yields, are subject to potentially greater fluctuations in value from changes in interest rates than obligations with shorter maturities. 
Volatility Risk. Volatility risk refers to the magnitude of the movement, but not the direction of the movement, in a financial instruments
price over a defined time period. Large increases or decreases in a financial instruments price over a relative time period typically indicate greater volatility risk, while small increases or decreases in its price typically indicate lower
volatility risk.  Derivatives may have little or no initial cash investment relative to their market value exposure and therefore can produce significant gains or
losses in excess of their cost due to unanticipated changes in the market risk factors and the overall market. This use of embedded leverage allows the Fund to increase its market value exposure relative to its net assets and can substantially
increase the volatility of the Funds performance. In instances where the Fund is using derivatives to decrease, or hedge, exposures to market risk factors for securities held by the Fund, there are also risks that those derivatives may not
perform as expected resulting in losses for the combined or hedged positions. Some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the Funds initial investment. 
 
22        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


   
  5. Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative
Instruments (Continued)      Additional associated risks from investing in derivatives also exist and potentially could have significant
effects on the valuation of the derivative and the Fund. Typically, the associated risks are not the risks that the Fund is attempting to increase or decrease exposure to, per its investment objectives, but are the additional risks from investing in
derivatives. Examples of these associated risks are liquidity risk, which is the risk that the Fund will not be able to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner, and counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that the counterparty
will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund.      The Funds actual exposures to these market risk factors and associated risks during the
period are discussed in further detail, by derivative type, below.  Futures Contracts 
A futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity, financial instrument or currency at a negotiated price on a stipulated future date.
The Fund may buy and sell futures contracts and may also buy or write put or call options on these futures contracts. Futures contracts and options thereon are generally entered into on a regulated futures exchange and cleared through a
clearinghouse associated with the exchange.      Upon entering into a futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit either cash or securities
(initial margin) in an amount equal to a certain percentage of the contract value in an account registered in the futures commission merchants name. Subsequent payments (variation margin) are paid to or from the futures commission merchant
each day equal to the daily changes in the contract value. Such payments are recorded as unrealized gains and losses. Should the Fund fail to make requested variation margin payments, the futures commission merchant can gain access to the initial
margin to satisfy the Funds payment obligations.      Futures contracts are reported on a schedule following the Statement of Investments.
Securities held by a futures commission merchant to cover initial margin requirements on open futures contracts are noted in the Statement of Investments. Cash held by a futures commission merchant to cover initial margin requirements on open
futures contracts and the receivable and/or payable for the daily mark to market for the variation margin are noted in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The net change in unrealized appreciation and depreciation is reported in the Statement
of Operations. Realized gains (losses) are reported in the Statement of Operations at the closing or expiration of futures contracts.      The
Fund has purchased futures contracts on various bonds and notes to increase exposure to interest rate risk.      The Fund has sold futures
contracts on various bonds and notes to decrease exposure to interest rate risk.      During the year ended January 30, 2015, the Fund had
an ending monthly average market value of $13,235,763 and $9,189,524 on futures contracts purchased and sold, respectively. 
    Additional associated risks of entering into futures contracts (and related options) include the possibility that there may be an illiquid market
where the Fund is unable to liquidate the contract or enter into an offsetting position and, if used for hedging purposes, the risk that the price of the contract will correlate imperfectly with the prices of the Funds securities.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Continued 
   
5. Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments (Continued) 
Counterparty Credit Risk. Derivative positions are subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund intends to
enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that the Manager believes to be creditworthy at the time of the transaction.      For
financial reporting purposes, the Fund does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities that are subject to netting arrangements in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may
impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other events.      The Funds risk of loss
from counterparty credit risk on exchange-traded derivatives cleared through a clearinghouse and for centrally cleared swaps is generally considered lower than as compared to OTC derivatives. However, counterparty credit risk exists with respect to
initial and variation margin deposited/paid by the Fund that is held in futures commission merchant, broker and/or clearinghouse accounts for such exchange-traded derivatives and for centrally cleared swaps. 
    With respect to centrally cleared swaps, such transactions will be submitted for clearing, and if cleared, will be held in accounts at futures
commission merchants or brokers that are members of clearinghouses. While brokers, futures commission merchants and clearinghouses are required to segregate customer margin from their own assets, in the event that a broker, futures commission
merchant or clearinghouse becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy and at that time there is a shortfall in the aggregate amount of margin held by the broker, futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for all its customers, U.S. bankruptcy laws
will typically allocate that shortfall on a pro-rata basis across all the brokers, futures commission merchants or clearinghouses customers, potentially resulting in losses to the Fund. 
    There is the risk that a broker, futures commission merchant or clearinghouse will decline to clear a transaction on the Funds behalf, and
the Fund may be required to pay a termination fee to the executing broker with whom the Fund initially enters into the transaction. Clearinghouses may also be permitted to terminate centrally cleared swaps at any time. The Fund is also subject to
the risk that the broker or futures commission merchant will improperly use the Funds assets deposited/paid as initial or variation margin to satisfy payment obligations of another customer. In the event of a default by another customer of the
broker or futures commission merchant, the Fund might not receive its variation margin payments from the clearinghouse, due to the manner in which variation margin payments are aggregated for all customers of the broker/futures commission merchant.
     Collateral and margin requirements differ by type of derivative. Margin requirements are established by the broker, futures commission
merchant or clearinghouse for exchange-traded and cleared derivatives, including centrally cleared swaps. Brokers, futures commission merchants and clearinghouses can ask for margin in excess of the regulatory minimum, or increase the margin amount,
in certain circumstances.      For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Fund, if any,
is reported separately on the Statement of Assets and Liabilities as cash pledged as collateral. Non-cash collateral pledged by the Fund, if any, is noted in the Statement of Investments. Generally, the amount of collateral due from or to a
party must

  5. Risk Exposures and the Use of Derivative Instruments
(Continued)  exceed a minimum transfer amount threshold (e.g. $250,000) before a transfer has to be made. To the extent amounts due to the Fund from its
counterparties are not fully collateralized, contractually or otherwise, the Fund bears the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance.  The following table

8. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates  Management Fees. Under
the investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Manager a management fee based on the daily net assets of the Fund at an annual rate as shown in the following table:   








   Fee Schedule
 

 Up to $1 billion
  
 
0.40
% 

 Over $1 billion
  
 
0.35
  
 The Funds management fee for the fiscal year ended January 30, 2015 was 0.40% of average annual net assets
before any applicable waivers.  Sub-Adviser Fees. The Manager has retained the Sub-Adviser to provide the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund.
Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Manager pays the Sub-Adviser an annual fee in monthly installments, equal to a percentage of the investment management fee collected by the Manager from the Fund, which shall be calculated after any investment
management fee waivers. The fee paid to the Sub-Adviser is paid by the Manager, not by the Fund.  Transfer Agent Fees. OFI Global (the Transfer
Agent) serves as the transfer and shareholder servicing agent for the Fund. The Fund pays the Transfer Agent a fee based on annual net assets. Fees incurred and average net assets for each class with respect to these services are detailed
in the Statement of Operations and Financial Highlights, respectively.  Sub-Transfer Agent Fees. The Transfer Agent has retained Shareholder Services,
Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of OFI (the Sub-Transfer Agent), to provide the day-to-day transfer agent and shareholder servicing of the Fund. Under the Sub-Transfer Agency Agreement, the Transfer Agent pays the Sub-Transfer Agent an
annual fee in monthly installments, equal to a percentage of the transfer agent fee collected by the Transfer Agent from the Fund, which shall be calculated after any applicable fee waivers. The fee paid to the Sub-Transfer Agent is paid by the
Transfer Agent, not by the Fund.  Directors Compensation. The Funds Board of Directors (Board) has adopted a compensation deferral
plan for Independent Directors that enables directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from the Fund. For purposes of determining the amount owed to the Director under the plan,
deferred amounts are treated as though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or in other Oppenheimer funds selected by the Director. The Fund purchases shares of the funds selected for deferral by the Director in amounts equal
to his or her deemed investment, resulting in a Fund asset equal to the deferred compensation liability. Such assets are included as a component of Other within the asset section of the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Deferral of
directors fees under the plan will not affect the net assets of the Fund and will not materially affect the Funds assets, liabilities or net investment income per share. Amounts will be deferred until distributed in accordance with the
compensation deferral plan. 
 
26        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


   
  8. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates (Continued)
 Waivers and Reimbursements of Expenses. The Manager will waive fees and/or reimburse Fund expenses in an amount equal to the indirect management fees
incurred through the Funds investment in IMMF. During the year ended January 30, 2015, the Manager waived fees and/or reimbursed the Fund $3,924 for IMMF management fees. 
These undertakings may be modified or terminated as set forth according to the terms in the prospectus. 
   
9. Pending Litigation  In 2009, seven class action lawsuits were filed in the
U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (OFI), OppenheimerFunds Distributor, Inc., the Funds principal underwriter and distributor (the Distributor), and certain funds (but not
including the Fund) advised by OFI Global Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by the Distributor (the Defendant Funds). The lawsuits also named as defendants certain officers and current and former Directors of the respective
Defendant Funds. The lawsuits raised claims under federal securities laws and alleged, among other things, that the disclosure documents of the respective Defendant Funds contained misrepresentations and omissions and that the respective Defendant
Funds investment policies were not followed. The plaintiffs in these actions sought unspecified damages, equitable relief and awards of attorneys fees and litigation expenses. The Defendant Funds Boards of Directors also engaged
counsel to represent the Funds and the present and former Independent Directors named in those suits. In March 2014, the parties in six of these lawsuits executed stipulations and agreements of settlement resolving those actions. In July 2014, the
court entered an order and final judgment approving the settlements as fair, reasonable and adequate. The settlements do not resolve a seventh outstanding lawsuit relating to Oppenheimer Rochester California Municipal Fund (the California Fund
Suit). OFI believes the California Fund Suit is without legal merit and is defending the suit vigorously. While it is premature to render any opinion as to the outcome in the California Fund Suit, or whether any costs that OFI may bear in
defending the California Fund Suit might not be reimbursed by insurance, OFI believes the California Fund Suit should not impair the ability of OFI or the Distributor to perform their respective duties to the Fund, and that the outcome of the
California Fund Suit should not have any material effect on the operations of any of the Oppenheimer funds.

BOARD APPROVAL OF THE FUNDS INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS Unaudited   
  The Fund has entered into an investment
advisory agreement with OFI Global Asset Management, Inc. (OFI Global or the Adviser), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (OFI or the Sub-Adviser) (OFI Global and
OFI together the Managers) and OFI Global has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with OFI whereby OFI provides investment sub-advisory services to the Fund (collectively, the Agreements). Each year, the Board
of Directors (the Board), including a majority of the independent Directors, is required to determine whether to renew the Agreements. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, requires that the Board request and evaluate, and that
the Managers provide, such information as may be reasonably necessary to evaluate the terms of the Agreements. The Board employs an independent consultant to prepare a report that provides information, including comparative information that the
Board requests for that purpose. In addition to in-person meetings focused on this evaluation, the Board receives information throughout the year regarding Fund services, fees, expenses and performance. 
The Adviser, Sub-Adviser and the independent consultant provided information to the Board on the following factors: (i) the nature, quality and
extent of the Managers services, (ii) the investment performance of the Fund and the Managers, (iii) the fees and expenses of the Fund, including comparative expense information, (iv) the profitability of the Managers and their
affiliates, including an analysis of the cost of providing services, (v) whether economies of scale are realized as the Fund grows and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for Fund investors and (vi) other benefits to the
Managers from their relationship with the Fund. The Board was aware that there are alternatives to retaining the Managers.  Outlined below is a
summary of the principal information considered by the Board as well as the Boards conclusions.  Nature, Quality and Extent of Services.
The Board considered information about the nature, quality and extent of the services provided to the Fund and information regarding the Managers key personnel who provide such services. The Sub-Advisers duties include providing the Fund
with the services of the portfolio manager and the Sub-Advisers investment team, who provide research, analysis and other advisory services in regard to the Funds investments; securities trading services; oversight of third-party service
providers; monitoring compliance with applicable Fund policies and procedures and adherence to the Funds investment restrictions; and risk management. The Managers are responsible for providing certain administrative services to the Fund as
well. Those services include providing and supervising all administrative and clerical personnel who are necessary in order to provide effective corporate administration for the Fund; compiling and maintaining records with respect to the Funds
operations; preparing and filing reports required by the Securities and Exchange Commission; preparing periodic reports regarding the operations of the Fund for its shareholders; preparing proxy materials for shareholder meetings; and preparing the
registration statements required by Federal and state securities laws for the sale of the Funds shares. The Managers also provide the Fund with office space, facilities and equipment. 
The Board also considered the quality of the services provided and the quality of the Managers resources that are available to the Fund. The Board
took account of the fact that the Sub-Adviser has had over fifty years of experience as an investment adviser and that its assets under management rank it among the top mutual fund managers in the United States. The Board evaluated the
Sub-Advisers advisory, administrative, accounting, legal, compliance

BOARD APPROVAL OF THE FUNDS INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND SUB-ADVISORY AGREEMENTS Unaudited / Continued  services and risk management, and
information the Board has received regarding the experience and professional qualifications of the Managers key personnel and the size and functions of its staff. In its evaluation of the quality of the portfolio management services provided,
the Board considered the experience of Young-Sup Lee, the portfolio manager for the Fund, and the Sub-Advisers investment team and analysts. The Board members also considered the totality of their experiences with the Managers as directors or
trustees of the Fund and other funds advised by the Managers. The Board considered information regarding the quality of services provided by affiliates of the Managers, which its members have become knowledgeable about in connection with the renewal
of the Funds service agreements. The Board concluded, in light of the Managers experience, reputation, personnel, operations and resources that the Fund benefits from the services provided under the Agreements. 
Investment Performance of the Manager and the Fund. Throughout the year, the Manager provided information on the investment performance of
the Fund, including comparative performance information. The Board also reviewed information, prepared by the Manager and by the independent consultant, comparing the Funds historical performance to relevant market indices and to the
performance of other retail inflation-protected bond funds. The Board noted that the Fund slightly underperformed its performance category median during the one-year period and underperformed its performance category median during the three-year
period.  Costs of Services by the Manager. The Board reviewed the fees paid to the Manager and the other expenses borne by the Fund. The
Board noted that the Manager, not the Fund, pays the Sub-Advisers fee under the sub-advisory agreement. The independent consultant provided comparative data in regard to the fees and expenses of the Fund and other retail inflation-protected
bond funds with comparable asset levels and distribution features. The Board noted that the Funds contractual management fee and total expenses were lower than its peer group median and category median. The Board also noted that within the
total asset range of $100 to $250 million, the Funds effective management fee rate was equal to its peer group median and category median. 
Economies of Scale and Profits Realized by the Manager. The Board considered information regarding the Managers costs in serving as the
Funds investment adviser, including the costs associated with the personnel and systems necessary to manage the Fund, and information regarding the Managers profitability from its relationship with the Fund. The Board reviewed whether
the Manager may realize economies of scale in managing and supporting the Fund. The Board noted that the Fund currently has management fee breakpoints, which are intended to share with Fund shareholders economies of scale that may exist as the
Funds assets grow.  Other Benefits to the Managers. In addition to considering the profits realized by the Managers, the Board
considered information that was provided regarding the direct and indirect benefits the Managers receive as a result of their relationship with the Fund, including compensation paid to the Managers affiliates. The Board also considered that
the Managers must be able to pay and retain experienced professional personnel at competitive rates to provide quality services to the Fund. 
Conclusions. These factors were also considered by the independent Directors meeting separately from the full Board, assisted by experienced
counsel to the Fund and to the 
 
30        OPPENHEIMER MASTER INFLATION PROTECTED SECURITIES FUND, LLC 


independent Directors. Fund counsel and the independent Directors counsel are independent of the Managers within the
meaning and intent of the Securities and Exchange Commission Rules.  Based on its review of the information it received and its evaluations described
above, the Board, including a majority of the independent Directors, decided to continue the Agreements through August 31, 2015. In arriving at its decision, the Board did not identify any factor or factors as being more important than others,
but considered all of the above information, and considered the terms and conditions of the Agreements, including the management fees, in light of all the surrounding circumstances.

PORTFOLIO PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES;

This is to inform you about OppenheimerFunds householding policy. If more than one member of your household maintains an account in a particular fund,
OppenheimerFunds will mail only one copy of the funds prospectus (or, if available, the funds summary prospectus), annual and semiannual report and privacy policy. The consolidation of these mailings, called householding, benefits your
fund through reduced mailing expense, and benefits you by reducing the volume of mail you receive from OppenheimerFunds. Householding does not affect the delivery of your account statements. 
Please note that we will continue to household these mailings for as long as you remain an OppenheimerFunds shareholder, unless you request otherwise. If
you prefer to receive multiple copies of these materials, please call us at 1.800.CALL-OPP (225-5677). You may also notify us in writing or via email. We will begin sending you individual copies of the prospectus (or, if available, the
summary prospectus), reports and privacy policy within 30 days of receiving your request to stop householding.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Inflation Protected Bond Fund among 
202,
202,
172
and 
113
Inflation-Protected Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

				Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. 
Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			



2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

				This yield has not been adjusted for inflation. Because inflation fluctuates, it cannot be projected into the future precisely enough to be included in the yield calculation.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

*157 of our 332 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 134 of these 157 (85%) funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 215 of 317 (68%), 183 of 225 (81%), 149 of 180 (83%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
36 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 6/30/17 (includes all share classes). 34 of these 36 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 38 of 39, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 6/30/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 162 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 6/30/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.
