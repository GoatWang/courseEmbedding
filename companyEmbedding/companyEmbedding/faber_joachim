Calligraphy · Handlettering









‟I really like working with fineliners like the Faber-Castell Ecco Pigment, as they are perfect for quick calligraphy sketches or handlettering. The pens with the thicker 0.5 to 0.7 nibs can be used like small dip pens, the thinner nibs are great for fine, elegant handwriting.”
