Davis Advisors Launches Three Transparent Actively Managed Equity ETFs
Jan 12 17
Davis Advisors announced the launch of three transparent actively-managed exchange traded funds (ETFs), Davis Select U.S. Equity ETF (DUSA), Davis Select Financial ETF (DFNL), and Davis Select Worldwide ETF (DWLD). They are the first ETFs offered by Davis and among the first true actively-managed equity ETFs in the industry, using a fundamental bottom up approach. Davis has decades of experience investing in these areas. Each ETF utilizes the Davis Investment Discipline and is a high-conviction, best ideas, benchmark-agnostic portfolio. The ETFs have low expected portfolio turnover and a strategic long-term time investment horizon. Davis ETFs offer investors the traditional benefits of ETFs in general, which include low costs, tax efficiency, intraday liquidity, and transparency. DUSA is a portfolio of U.S., large-cap businesses, managed by Chris Davis and his partner Danton Goei. It has about 20 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.60%. DUSA may serve as an attractive core holding to provide investors with exposure to best-of-breed, U.S. large-cap companies or as a complement to passive, index-oriented strategies, potentially enhancing returns. DFNL is a portfolio of best-of-breed financial companies managed by Chris Davis. It has about 20 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.65%. DWLD is a portfolio of best-of-breed businesses in the U.S. and abroad managed by Danton Goei and Chris Davis. It has about 40 holdings and an expense ratio of 0.65%. As roughly 75% of the world’s publicly traded companies lie outside of the U.S., DWLD seeks to provide investors with diversification and access to attractive businesses around the world. Davis has decades of experience investing in international equities.

TURNER V. DAVIS SELECTED ADVISERS
Back to Litigation Tracker







SummaryDocumentsCommentsBlog Entries


 A shareholder of Davis New York Venture Fund initiated a lawsuit against the investment adviser (Davis Selected Advisers) and the distributor (Davis Distributors) of this Fund. This lawsuit sought to recover for the Fund certain excessive and disproportionate fees paid by the Fund to the defendants, who allegedly breached their fiduciary duties to the Fund under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. This lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. On June 1, 2011, the Court granted the defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, ending this case at the District Court level. The Court determined that the plaintiff’s allegations largely consisted of general conclusions and not specific facts and the plaintiff did not explain how any of its alleged facts met the Gartenberg test, in which a particular fee is “so disproportionately large that its bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm’s-length bargaining.” The plaintiff in this case has appealed the Motion to Dismiss and other Court rulings to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  The plaintiff filed his opening brief on January 30, 2014.  In his brief, the plaintiff argues the amended complaint sufficiently alleges that the investment adviser charged the New York Venture Fund excessive and disproportionate advisory fees and Rule 12b-1 fees. Davis filed its answering brief and oral argument on the case was held on June 10, 2015.  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of this case on September 29, 2015, ruling that the plaintiff's complaint only offered conclusory statements and "inapt comparisons."

Merrill Lynch Asset Management, Inc.

                    On June 1, 2011, the Court granted the Motion to Dismiss filed by the defendants and ended the case. The Court held that the plaintiff did not explain how any of its alleged facts met the Gartenberg test, in which a particular fee is “so disproportionately large that its bears no reasonable relationship to the services rendered and could not have been the product of arm’s-length bargaining.”
