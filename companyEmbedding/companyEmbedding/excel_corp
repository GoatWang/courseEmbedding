Assignment 17.10

Posted on December 21, 2014 by pdd1415 





Chief Labor = $25 per hour
All units made in the same year (advantage) = 80% learning curve
1st unit requires 100000 hour of labor
Learning occurs only one year. Not carried over from year to year.

It would be more economical to build four units the first year and store them (space widgets) because all units have advantage of an 80% learning curve.
In example, for the first unit:
100000 hour/ $25 per hour = $ 4000
Advantage: $ 4000 × 0.8 = $3200
So, $4000 – $3200 = $800 per unit.
Compare to build one unit in each of the year. The cost would be maintained with the values of $4000 because there is no advantage of learning curve.

Total G & A                                                     $310,000
Manufacturing Cost = Variable costs + Factory Expenses + General and Administrative Expenses
= $3,280,000 + $300,000 + $310,000
= $3,890,000
Sales, staff, salaries and commissions      $100,000
Total Cost = Manufacturing costs + Sales, staff, salaries and commissions
= $3,990,000
Profit Margin = Profit / Sales = 15%
Profit (P) = Selling Price (S) – Total Cost (CT)
S = P + CT
S = 0.15S + CT
S – 0.15S = CT
0.85S = CT
S = CT / 0.85
S = $3,990,000 / 0.85
S = $4,694,117.65
Total Annual Sales = 60 units
Selling Price for One Turbine = S / 60
= $4,694,117.65 / 60
Selling Price                           = $78,235.29 per unit

In 1985:
Unit purchase =$35000
Capacity=100ft^3/min
In 2012:
Capacity=1000ft^3/min
Cost inflation=5%
Cost purchase dust collector=?
SOLUTION:
With cost inflation 5% per year, the cost becomes 35000(1+0.05)^22 =  35000(2.92526) = $102389
Thus, the estimation cost is,
  where the exponent of 0.61 come from table 16.4 for cyclone dust collector.

ASSIGNMENT 13.8:  Literature study of Hot Isostatic Process (HIP)

Posted on December 5, 2014 by pdd1415 




Hot isostatic pressing (HIP) is a manufacturing process used to reduce the porosity of metals and increase the density of many ceramic materials. This improves the material’s mechanical properties and workability.
Hot isostatic processing (HIP) subjects parts to the simultaneous application of heat and high pressure in an inert gas atmosphere. The pressure is uniform in all directions (isostatic) . In 40 years the process has moved from a laboratory curiosity to an important commercial process.
HIPing currently is used most widely in the following applications:
1.Upgrading castings: HIPing closes internal porosity in sand and investment castings. This improves fatigue and fracture properties and reliability in general. It allows castings to be used in critical applications here-to-for reserved for forgings.
2.Consolidation of powders: Metals, ceramic, and composite powders, particularly those with poor cohesion as powder, are compacted to full density by HIPing. These may be near net- shape parts or billets for further work by forging or rolling.
3.Dfftusion bonding: The HIP process grew out of a process for diffusion bonding corrosion resistant cladding on nuclear fuel elements.
4.Structural ceramics: HIPing is used to produce near-net shape parts from structural ceramics like silicon nitride and silicon carbide.
5.Improvement of fatigue-damaged parts: Certain types of fatigue damage can be healed by HIPing, thus extending the life of aircraft components.
Freedom in design
The HIP technology makes it possible to produce metal components unobtainable by other means. Designs with complex geometry and high performance requirements can be produced without weld joints. i.e.  valve bodies can be produced with flanges without welding.
Reduction in welding
The ability to produce metal components with more complex geometry, reduces the number of critical and costly weld joints considerably. The reduction in welding reduces the need for time consuming on site welding and weld joint inspection.
Material savings
Net near shape processing reduces material shavings. complex components often require a lot of machining, resulting in costly material shavings. Net near shape processing reduces the need for machining significantly.
Isotropic mechanical properties
HIP-metal has the same properties in all directions. This is due to the fine and uniform grain size. Material produced by traditional methods have texture that gives rise to different mechanical values depending on the direction. In HIP-material all directions are good directions.
Minimized HISC problems
The probability of hydrogen induced stress cracking (HISC), is virtually eliminated. The fine grain structure of HIP-metal greatly reduces the possibility of HISC.
Narrow scatter band of mechanical properties
Scatter in the mechanical properties are much lower than castings and forgings. The mechanical properties of a specific steel grade will vary across different production series. The reason being uncontrollable parameters that influence the final result. The variation in the mechanical properties are lower for HIP-metal compared to metal produced by forging or casting.
Better Ultrasonic Inspecatbility
Heavy sections can be inspected for inner defects by ultrasonic testing. HIP-metal has a finer grain structure compared to metal produced by traditional methods, especially in thicker sections. A coarse grain structure produces static, thereby preventing ultrasonic testing. HIP-metals finer grain size increases the possibility of ultrasonic testing.
Cladding
The production method makes it possible to produce components consisting of layers of different steel grades. Cladding offers an additional dimension to the freedom in design.
 
However, isostatic pressing is applicable in general only to small production quantities, typically less than 10,000 pieces annually. It is a more costly method than other PM processes due to its slow processing speed and the need for expendable tooling. Lastly, it is a near-net shape process technology suited to parts with much wider tolerance requirements than other PM processes can produce.

PUGH CONCEPT SELECTION METHOD

Posted on November 11, 2014November 11, 2014 by pdd1415 




Pugh Matrix (PM)
What is it and what does it do? The Pugh Matrix (PM) is a type of Matrix Diagram that allows for the comparison of a number of design candidates leading ultimately to which best meets a set of criteria. It also permits a degree of qualitative optimization of the alternative concepts through the generation of hybrid candidates. The Pugh Matrix is easy to use and relies upon a series of pairwise comparisons between design candidates against a number of criteria or requirements. One of its key advantages over other decision-making tools such as the Decision Matrix is its ability to handle a large number of decision criteria.
 Overview
The basic concept of a Pugh Matrix is both simple and elegant. Figure 1 shows a completed Pugh Matrix that has been used to evaluate and select from a number of design alternatives.

Figure 1: Example of a completed Pugh Matrix
Figure 1 shows a completed Pugh Matrix for four candidate design concepts called A, B, C and D which can be found along the top of the matrix. These concepts have been evaluated against 10 criteria. In constructing a Pugh Matrix, one design concept, in this example “Design Concept A” is selected as the “baseline”. This baseline is score as “S” against all of the criteria. The other candidate design concepts are then compared in a pairwise fashion against Design Concept A for each of the criteria. If a candidate design concept is:

better than the baseline a “+” is entered in the appropriate cell
worse than the baseline a “-” is entered in the appropriate cell
the same than the baseline a “S” is entered in the appropriate cell

Hence, in figure 1:

Design Concept B is better than Design Concept A baseline for criteria 1
Design Concept B is worse than Design Concept A baseline for criteria 2
Design Concept B is the same as Design Concept A baseline for criteria 3
The overall evaluation is made by adding the “+” and “-“ for each design concept.

The Pugh Matrix can also be used to perform qualitative optimization by combining the candidate concept designs to form hybrid candidates. Figure 1 shows two such hybrids “Concept BC” and “Concept BD”.
The Pugh Process
The process for constructing a Pugh Matrix comprises five steps. This assumes that alternative candidate design options (or decision options) have been determined.
Step 1: identify and clearly define the criteria for selection. Typically when using a Pugh Matrix to select between a number of candidate design options the design requirements can be used either in part or in whole. Ideally the design requirements should reflect both the user-customer as well as other key stakeholders including internal stakeholders. The robustness and validity of the outcome is fundamentally dependent on an appropriate set of criteria/requirements. Rushing this step usually results in a non- robust outcome that is challenged and overturned.
Step 2: Use one candidate design option as the baseline and core all criteria/requirements as „S‟ (some people prefer to use an O) for this baseline. If appropriate, a good choice is to, use the previous design for the baseline because it exists and therefore its performance should be reasonably well known.
Step 3: Compare each candidate design option against the baseline design, criteria by criteria (or requirement by requirement) and decide a “pair-wise score with:

S = same
+ = better
– = worse

It is also possible to add extra levels of discrimination by using:

++ = much better
— = much worse

Some people use a 1 to 5 scale where the baseline/same is a 3 with 1 and 2 being much worse and worse respectively, and 4 and 5 being better and much better respectively
Step 4: For each candidate design option the total score can be calculated by summing the number of +‟s and –„s. The highest ranked score is the “winner” but use common sense – DON‟T just select “highest” ranked concept.
Step 5: Having scored each candidate design option consider hybrids by combining where possible the best from each alternative. This is form of qualitative optimization.
Step 6: Make the decision and record reasons behind decisions. Quite often with a Pugh Matrix there is no clear “winner” but there is often a clear “loser” in such cases perform a sanity check (does the decision make sense) and remove the losing option. At this point the criteria/requirements can be weighted to give better differentiation. Typically the weighting is on a 1 to 5 scale with 1 the lowest and 5 the highest weighting. If there is still no clear winner, the matrix is basically saying that there is not enough information to discriminate between the options. In such cases it will be necessary to:

refine the criteria/requirements
use an alternative selection approach
perform more work to gain the information to be able to select between the options

It is also recommended at this point to undertake a sensitivity analysis. This can be performed in many ways that include:

flexing the importance numbers by ± 1 and monitoring the ranking of the candidates
removing criteria/requirements from the assessment and monitoring the ranking of candidates

Soft touch Coatings Promote Product Aesthetics & Longevity








Soft touch coatings make characteristically unpleasant surfaces, such as those of many plastics and metals, more appealing to customers. These coatings can be formulated to feel rubbery, velvety, leathery—and nearly anything in between—to positively differentiate products from the competition.
While customers are drawn to soft touch coated products for their aesthetics, Aexcel’s soft touch coatings also provide excellent performance attributes, exhibiting exceptional durability, mar resistance, dust resistance, adhesion, and chemical resistance. Our soft touch coatings deliver these performance attributes at a much thinner film thickness (1.5–2 dry mils) than traditional coatings, resulting in a quicker cure time and reduced work-in-process inventory.
Our soft touch coatings are available in a variety of chemistries, including:

Two-component solvent-based soft touch coatings
One- and two-component waterborne soft touch coatings
Air-dry and force-dry formulations

These soft touch coatings can be formulated to meet your unique application requirements and performance specifications. Our expert formulators will work with you to develop a coating that fits seamlessly into your production line and provides desired product surface effects and performance. Contact us today at 440-974-3800 or fill out an online form and one of our technical representatives will be in touch within the next one to two business days.

Tech & SDS Sheets



Description
Complete system protection for optimum system performance.
Nothing corrodes a cooling tower system faster than the water that flows through it. Water re-circulation and evaporation cause buildup of scale and mineral deposits. Excel attacks the most complex water problems commonly found in cooling tower systems. It removes and prevents future buildup of scale, mineral deposits and rust. Its concentrated formula targets impurities that cause hard water scale and increases pH levels to prevent rust. Excel forms a protective coating on all metal surfaces throughout the cooling tower.

Conditions the water
