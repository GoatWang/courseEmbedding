Themaven, Inc. Company Profile

   Integrated Surgical Systems (ISS) wanted to be the hippest company around with its ROBODOC Surgical Assistant System, a computer-controlled robot used in hip and knee replacements. However, ISS ceased operations in mid-2005 because of lawsuits and lack of funding, and it sold its ROBODOC assets to Novatrix Biomedical in 2007. Using those assets, Novatrix has set up a new company called Curexo Medical to continue development of ROBODOC, which is sold in Europe, Asia, and other regions and received FDA approval in 2008. Meanwhile, ISS used the money from the asset sale to pay its debtors and is looking for acquisition opportunities.
