She grew up watching Wagon Train, Gunsmoke, Bonanza, and The Waltons. Kathy's childhood was spent on a farm in central Illinois, where she learned the value of family, hard work, and developed a "pioneer" spirit. She loves cooking for her friends and family and sharing recipes.  Kathy and her husband have traveled the Oregon Trail from Independence, Missouri to Oregon City. She has followed the twists of the Platte River throughout the trail states. She has seen Chimney Rock, Independence Rock and Courthouse Rock. Kathy has walked the wagon wheel ruts of Ash Hollow made by previous trains over 150 years ago and has visited Forts Laramie, Kearney, and Vancouver.  She has published three short contemporary romances in Woman's World Magazine, but her first love is historical westerns. Kathy worked in a library which was pure heaven for her, surrounded by all those books. She started one of the first successful romance book discussion groups in a public library. She is a member of Romance Writers of America. Kathy loves flower gardening, genealogy, reading, and watching westerns or Hallmark movies. Kathy lives with her husband and is the mother of three sons and five beautiful grandchildren.View: Sort by --Price: Lowest firstPrice: Highest firstProduct Name: A to ZProduct Name: Z to ADate Added: Latest firstDate Added: Earliest first      Quick view   $2.99   Montana Home   $2.99   Add to cart   More   Add to Wishlist  Showing 1 - 1 of 1 item
