1 Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy.  These risks are likely to be greater for emerging markets than in developed markets.  Prices of securities in emerging markets can fluctuate more significantly than the prices of companies in more developed countries.  Securities of emerging market issuers generally have more risk than securities issued by issuers in more developed markets.  The less developed the country, the greater affect the risks  may have in an investment, and as a result, an investment may exhibit a higher degree of volatility than either the general domestic securities market or the securities markets of developed foreign countries.

Asset allocation solutions








Asset allocation, the foundation for long-term investing

Asset allocation1 creates a consistent investment structure to help you stay focused on long-term goals through turbulent market cycles. In addition to helping maintain a portfolio that matches your appetite for risk, this strategy can help diversify your portfolio across asset classes and markets as well as support a consistent, disciplined approach to investing. We believe that employing proper asset allocation is the key to a long-term investment strategy, which is why we offer a variety of exclusive, customized asset allocation solutions. 
An investment plan as unique as your needs
Financial professionals2 from HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.3  can help you to develop a custom asset allocation strategy by taking the time to understand your risk tolerance, time horizon, financial goals, liquidity needs and other relevant factors. Our first priority is to follow an investment strategy with which you are comfortable. Start with scheduling a review by calling us at 866.586.4722 or by submitting an online request. 
Asset allocation solutions to potentially enhance your portfolio
Because we place a strong emphasis on proper asset allocation, we're pleased to make a wide variety of HSBC asset allocation solutions available to our clients. 
HSBC Spectrum4 provides flexibility for a wide variety of investment styles through an open architecture asset allocation program:

Five asset allocation models. Models offer allocations to equity and fixed income mutual funds, money market funds and ETFs (exchange traded funds)
Assistance from your financial professional to evaluate allocation models that align with your tolerance for risk
Periodic evaluation of client accounts against their selected target model to determine if rebalancing is recommended
A minimum initial investment of $25,000

Form ADV Part 2 acts as a disclosure document for clients of the business and includes information such as advisory services offered, advisor's fee schedule, whether the investment advisor acts as a broker-dealer and transacts securities, disciplinary information, and conflicts of interest. This information should be read carefully and if you have any questions please reach out to your investment adviser representative.

1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.

PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.

Investing in Mutual funds







What are mutual funds?

Mutual funds are a type of pooled investment  vehicle.  Shareholders of a mutual fund  invest their money by purchasing shares of the fund.  The money that they pay for the shares is  pooled together and invested in a portfolio of securities, such as stocks,  bonds, or money market instruments. Mutual funds are professionally managed and operated by money managers, who maintain the portfolio in accordance with the fund's investments objectives as stated in the prospectus. 
Mutual funds, money market funds, and Exchange Traded Funds are sold by prospectus. Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Professional or call 866.586.4722. Read it carefully before you invest.
An investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in a money market fund.
Popular investment disciplines which can involve mutual funds include:

Asset allocation1: a disciplined approach to long-term investing, designed to seek consistent exposure to markets. This  approach does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot  eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns. However, it may  be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns.
Dollar cost averaging2: a strategy  in which securities, typically mutual funds, are purchased in fixed dollar amounts at regular intervals, regardless of what direction the market is moving. While this method doesn't guarantee against losses, over time, this can help to reduce the average cost of acquired shares.  
Target date ("life cycle") investing3: investors choose a fund with a specified target date near a personal need or goal (such as retirement) for which they will need to access their invested funds. Though target date investing does not protect against loss of principal, the fund's risk exposure is gradually reduced as a target date draws nearer to prepare for the approaching liquidity needs. 

HSBC Global Asset Management fund options
Our World Selection Funds4offer asset allocation solutions–designed to help reduce the roller-coaster ride that volatile market conditions can generate. The five different fund strategies are aligned to the full spectrum of risk profiles:

Income Strategy Fund, 

Conservative Strategy Fund,

Moderate Strategy Fund,

Balanced Strategy Fund and 
 
Aggressive Strategy Fund. 


Explore our other exclusive asset allocation solutions.



In addition, the suite of HSBC Funds5 includes domestic money market funds and domestic and international equity and debt funds6. The 

HSBC Emerging Markets Debt Fund, 
HSBC Emerging Markets Local Debt Fund, HSBC Frontier Markets Fund and the HSBC Total Return Fund
 all provide access to some of the world's fastest growing markets through the lens of HSBC's deep global knowledge and experience. 

Additional funds from leading managers
A financial professional7 from HSBC Securities can also help you choose from a broad selection of third-party mutual funds. Each of these funds is thoroughly screened and regularly reviewed by the HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research team8 - a global team of research analysts dedicated to helping enhance our clients' portfolios by identifying third party money managers that show sustainable competitive advantages within their asset class.
Take advantage of our mutual fund experience
Mutual funds offer a convenient avenue for entering financial markets and can also become integral parts of a broader investment strategy. To fully understand your personal investment objectives and help determine which funds may be suited for your needs, an HSBC Securities financial professional8 will take the time to conduct a thorough financial review. To schedule your review, or to receive information on funds offered through HSBC Securities, please call 866.586.4722 or schedule a consultation online.

1 Asset allocation is a method of diversification that positions assets among major investment categories. This tool may be used in an effort to manage risk and enhance returns. However, it does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss. It also cannot eliminate the risk of fluctuating prices and uncertain returns.
2 Dollar Cost Averaging is a plan of investing which allows you to take advantage of market fluctuations, but it does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
3 Target date funds invest in other funds, so performance can vary significantly based on the investment restrictions of the target date fund. A target date fund may have losses and does not guarantee that sufficient assets will be available for retirement or any specific return.
4 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. is the investment adviser for the HSBC World Selection Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), serves as the distributor of the Funds' shares.
5 HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. serves as the investment adviser to the HSBC Funds. Foreside Distribution Services, L.P., member FINRA, is the distributor of the HSBC Funds and is not affiliated with the Advisor. HSBC Global Asset Management (UK) Limited serves as investment subadviser to the HSBC Frontier Markets Fund. HSBC Global Asset Management (Hong Kong) Limited serves as subadviser to the HSBC RMB Fixed Income Fund.  HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., member NYSE, FINRA, SIPC is a sub-distributor of the HSBC Funds. Affiliates of HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc. receive fees for providing various services to the funds.
6 International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility that is heightened when investing in emerging or frontier markets. Foreign securities can be subject to greater risks than U.S. investments, including currency fluctuations, less liquid trading markets, greater price volatility, political and economic instability, less publicly available information, and changes in tax or currency laws or monetary policy. The risks of investing in emerging-market countries are greater than the risks generally associated with foreign investments. Frontier market countries generally have smaller economies and even less developed capital markets or legal and political systems than traditional emerging market countries. As a result, the risks of investing in emerging market countries are magnified in frontier market countries. Fixed income investments are subject to credit and interest-rate risk. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of interest and principal. Interest-rate risk refers to fluctuations in the value of a fixed-income security resulting from changes in the general level of interest rates. In a declining interest-rate environment, the portfolio may generate less income. In a rising interest-rate environment, bond prices fall.
7 Financial professional refers to Premier Wealth Advisors (PWA), Premier Relationship Advisors (PRA) and Financial Advisors (FA).  PWA/PRAs primarily focus on a full suite of Premier products and services while FAs primarily focus on a full suite of Advance products and services.  Both offer bank products through HSBC Bank (USA) N.A., investments and certain insurance products, including annuities, through HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. and traditional insurance products through HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc.
8 HSBC Global Funds Approvals & Research  team is a research and asset management capability utilized by certain HSBC companies in various regions around the world. In the U.S. the company offering these capabilities is HSBC Global Asset Management (USA) Inc.
United States persons (including U.S. citizens and residents) are subject to U.S. taxation on their worldwide income and may be subject to tax and other filing obligations with respect to their U.S. and non–U.S. accounts – including, for example, Form TD F 90–22.1 (Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts ("FBAR")). U.S. persons should consult a tax adviser for more information.

Equities and ETFs








What are ETFs and Equities?

Equities1 represent ownership stakes in corporations. Typical equities may include common stock, preferred stock, foreign equities and closed-end funds.
An ETF, or Exchange Traded Fund, is a collection of securities such as equities, bonds, and options that is bought and sold like a stock in real time on a stock exchange. Most ETFs are not actively managed, but instead are designed to track an index. In general the expense ratios of ETFs are relatively low. Because it trades like a stock, an ETF does not have its net asset value (NAV) calculated every day like a mutual fund does. 
Both equities and ETFs can offer potential growth from market price appreciation; however, they are subject to market volatility and thus, open to market price risk and potential loss of principal.
Exchange-traded funds are subject to risks similar to those of stocks. Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility such that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF but must be bought and sold on an exchange, like an indivudual equity.  ETFs are sold by prospectus.  Please consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus, which contains this and other information, can be obtained by calling your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. Financial Advisor or call 888-525-5757.  Read it carefully before you invest.
Ready to invest?
Before you invest in equities or ETFs, it's important to weigh the risks against the potential returns and carefully plan your strategy. In addition to utilizing the knowledge and support of your HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. financial professional2, you can leverage unique insights and analysis from HSBC Securities vast global resources to help you evaluate your investment possibilities. Get started with a comprehensive financial review by calling us at 866.586.4722 or by 
      scheduling a consultation online.

Why HSBC
Despite being one of the world's largest banks and financial institutions, HSBC has maintained excellence in service and stability. But don't take our word for it...





Greenwich Quality Leader & Share Leader for US Structured Products

Safest bank



HSBC was ranked as one of the world's 50 safest banks for 2014 by Global Finance magazine. Banks were selected by Global Finance magazine based on an evaluation of long-term credit ratings and total assets of the 500 largest banks worldwide.







HSBC has traveled a long way since its beginning in 1865 - from a small local bank to a leader in global banking and finance with a strong presence in the United States. Today, we believe that being part of a global organization brings strengths that benefit our clients - combining the advantages of worldwide presence and scale with local knowledge and service.
