The Steven is our respectful take on the original tassel moccasin - one of those iconic classics every shoemaker should master. You'll love the hand-stitched apron and the black box calf's impeccable shine. These loafers work great with a blue or grey suit and even better with a nice pair of tailored cuffed trousers and a blazer.

Construction: Goodyear Welt
Last: Union
Upper: Italian black calfskin / Hand-stitched apron
Sole: Italian leather / Beveled waist / Closed-channel stitching
Interior: Italian leather / Quilted heel cup + color-matching lining

Our shoes come in UK Sizes, which run a FULL SIZE larger than one’s US size. To keep things simple, we always show you both the UK size and its US equivalent. Cobbler Union's standard width is MEDIUM. To learn more about choosing your right shoe size click HERE.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"

From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
