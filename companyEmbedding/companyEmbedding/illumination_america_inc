SugarCUBE™ LED Illumination Systems








 SUGARCUBE™ SPECS SUGARCUBE™ LITE SPECS SUGARCUBE™ ULTRA SPECS MICROCUBE SPECS SUGARCUBE™ CAD DRAWINGS REVIEW PRODUCT

Unsurpassed Light Intensity with LED Efficiency

The SugarCUBE™ line of LED fiber optic illuminators provides the highest intensity light for a variety of laboratory and technical needs. Each member of the CUBE family couples an exceptionally bright LED with USHIO’s powerful electronic driver circuitry for maximum light output. The life of each LED light source is equivalent to approximately 300 tungsten halogen bulbs, allowing users to cut downtime and save thousands of dollars on bulb replacement. 

The SugarCUBE™ line - a model for every application

SugarCUBE™ Standard - A high intensity LED fiber optic illuminator available in white, red (624nm), blue (463nm), and green (523nm). 

SugarCUBE™ Ultra - For the most demanding applications, the SugarCUBE Ultra is the most powerful LED light engine available. It replaces the previous SugarCUBE Quad White model. The output is 764% greater than the previous top of the line Quad when using a 3mm LLG. Please see the datasheet for specifics. 

MicroCUBE - The MicroCUBE improves upon our SugarCUBE Ultra model for light guides larger than 8mm diameter. We have incorporated a pulse capability down to 10 microseconds with fast rise and fall times as well as a rear panel switch to select rising or falling edge triggers. The MicroCUBE delivers industry leading flicker free light output and offers an expected LED lifetime of up to 40,000 hours. This new model offers significant reductions in both cost and size. 

SugarCUBE™ LITE - For low-cost, high-lumen output, the SugarCUBE LITE offers superior technology in a cost-effective form factor. Its consumer-friendly pricing makes it ideal for many research and industrial uses. The LITE is available in bright white and can only be ordered from our website. 

SugarCUBE™ Multi-wavelength solutions - We can connect multiple SugarCUBEs together to create a switchable multi-wavelength system with a high output.

The buttons on the front panel are not working - what should I do?Most likely the unit is in Analog mode. There is a button on the back of the unit to return it to Front Panel Control.
I want to use a liquid light guide with the SugarCUBE Ultra illuminator and am concerned about damage to the light guide. Do you have any experience using liquid light guides with that illuminator?If you are using a liquid light guide it should be fine with the SugarCUBE Ultra. 
We currently buy the SugarCUBE LED illuminator from you, and would like to know the thread of the screws that are used to affix the adapters to the front.All of our adapters use a 4-40 thread. 
I am interested in buying a SugarCUBE and will be using it with a high frame rate camera. I am concerned about variations in the intensity that might cause a ‘strobing effect’ with the camera. Please comment on the stability of the intensity of output over time.The SugarCUBE product is actually used frequently in high speed imaging applications due to its high-intensity output and excellent stability. While environmental factors will play a role in the stability, we typically observe intensity stability of <0.5% under stable conditions. We recommend allowing the SugarCUBE to warm up for 5+ minutes to achieve this level of stability. Additionally, one unique property about the SugarCUBE is that the LED drive is DC current and not Pulse Width Modulated (PWM). This offers a special advantage for high speed video as the light is not pulsed. There is minimal ripple in the light and it has been shown to be flicker free at up to 750K frames per second (FPS). 
I previously purchased the SugarCUBE Quad from you, is the Ultra a direct replacement?The SugarCUBE Ultra is a higher performance replacement for the Quad. It has the unique advantage of being able to couple large amounts of light into smaller light guides than the Quad previously could. Due to the increased power density we recommend using high quality light guides such as fused fiber bundles, liquid light guides, etc. 
What are the dimensions of the SugarCUBE?
Can you provide a CAD model of your SugarCUBE?We have a CAD model of our SugarCUBE product located on the SugarCube page here.

Light Stripz™ Linear LED Engines for Retrofits and New Designs

LED Strip Light Options by American Illumination, Inc.




















04.15.2011 – Los Angeles, CA – Just in time for Lightfair, American Illumination’s Light Stripz™ are the ideal LED solution for lighting designers, electrical contractors, showrooms, distributors and manufacturers. Light Stripz™ features a sleek, watertight body with the look of a finished luminaire.
The Light Stripz™ (LS)are offered in 3” to 72” lengths. They are ideal for step lights, sconces, retail/display lighting, border/perimeter lighting, backlighting, furniture lights and more. Lighting designers incorporate Light Stripz for a variety of applications due to the low energy consumption, multiple CCT and voltage options, and various levels of output.
Sleek Design, Multiple Lengths and Easily Retrofitted
Perfect for outdoor step lights or indoor runs of cove lighting, the Light Stripz™ come in lengths from 3” to 72”. All linear Stripz have a narrow width under 1.25”, thus making the LS series great for slim fixtures and small to large installation locations. While the standard lead wire is excellent for Title 24 solutions, the Stripz can be easily retrofitted for T8 applications; end pieces can be fitted directly into the fluorescent socket and the flat diffuser can be replaced with a semi-circle one to resemble the T8 look. The LSS model is a rectangular LED array geared toward step light retrofits.
All-in-One Indoor/Outdoor Solution and Self-Ballasted Too!
For specifiers and contractors, Light Stripz™ is a hassle-free lighting solution. They are safe to install indoors or in sealed outdoor landscape fixtures; the potted LED compartment prevents moisture from disturbing the performance of the Stripz in most environments. The self-ballasted Light Stripz™ include various features such as an internal constant current driver, customizable 120° diffuser and integrated heat sink that limits the user’s need to purchase additional components for the system.
Designer Friendly with Multiple CCT’s and Dimmable
No matter where they are installed – a restaurant, bar, office, residence, displays, or even signage, American Illumination has the color to match the décor. Light Stripz™ are offered with various Correlated Color Temperatures (CCT), two different LED types, and are dimmable from 0-100%. White colors include Warm White (3000K), Natural White (4000K), and Cool White (6000K), while single colors such as Red, Blue, Green, or Amber are also available. Standard Light Stripz™ feature the ultra-efficient 3528 SMD LED’s, while users can upgrade to the higher output 5252 SMD LED models if more “punch” is needed. Dimmers will allow dimming from 0-100% which is great for mood lighting interior/residential applications.
Easy Installation for the Novice to the Artist
The Light Stripz™ are easy to install and combine, either in parallel or daisy chained and are the perfect solution for indoor or outdoor linear surfaces. Complete plug-and-play systems are available with end-to-end male-to-female connectors and include a lead and terminal unit. The sleek look, low-profile design and high light output make Light Stripz™ an ideal LED solution for retrofit or state-of-the-art lighting applications.
American Illumination also offers custom design services to create light engines for unique luminaires and specialty applications. For samples or additional information on the Light Stripz™, contact American Illumination at (310) 202-6500 or visit http://www.American-Illumination.com.

I am interested in replacing fluorescent tubes and fixtures used for indirect lighting in my “great room” in my home.  Please let me know how I can gain acess to your products which I found at your website. Thank-you.
