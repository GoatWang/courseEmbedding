Volaris, legally Concesionaria Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: VOLARA, NYSE: VLRS), is a Mexican low-cost airline based in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City with its hub in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Tijuana, and as well focus cities in Cancun, Los Angeles, and Monterrey. It is the country's second largest airline after Aeroméxico and serves domestic and international destinations within the Americas. It is a leading competitor in the Mexican domestic airline market, now with a market share of over 21% of domestic traffic.[1][2]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.
Initially, the airline avoided flying to Mexico City because of it being a congested and expensive airport. The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The airline is headquartered in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City.[35] It formerly had its headquarters on the first floor of Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 490 in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe.[36]

(BMV: VOLARA, NYSE: VLRS), is a Mexican low-cost airline based in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City with its hub in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Tijuana, and as well focus cities in Cancun, Los Angeles, and Monterrey. It is the country's second largest airline after Aeroméxico and serves domestic and international destinations within the Americas. It is a leading competitor in the Mexican domestic airline market, now with a market share of over 21% of domestic traffic.[1][2]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.
Initially, the airline avoided flying to Mexico City because of it being a congested and expensive airport. The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The airline is headquartered in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City.[35] It formerly had its headquarters on the first floor of Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 490 in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe.[36]

Volaris, legally Concesionaria Vuela Compañía de Aviación, S.A.B. de C.V. (BMV: VOLARA, NYSE: VLRS), is a Mexican low-cost airline based in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City with its hub in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Tijuana, and as well focus cities in Cancun, Los Angeles, and Monterrey. It is the country's second largest airline after Aeroméxico and serves domestic and international destinations within the Americas. It is a leading competitor in the Mexican domestic airline market, now with a market share of over 21% of domestic traffic.[1][2]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.
Initially, the airline avoided flying to Mexico City because of it being a congested and expensive airport. The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The airline is headquartered in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City.[35] It formerly had its headquarters on the first floor of Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 490 in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe.[36]

(BMV: VOLARA, NYSE: VLRS), is a Mexican low-cost airline based in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City with its hub in Guadalajara, Mexico City, and Tijuana, and as well focus cities in Cancun, Los Angeles, and Monterrey. It is the country's second largest airline after Aeroméxico and serves domestic and international destinations within the Americas. It is a leading competitor in the Mexican domestic airline market, now with a market share of over 21% of domestic traffic.[1][2]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.
Initially, the airline avoided flying to Mexico City because of it being a congested and expensive airport. The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The airline is headquartered in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City.[35] It formerly had its headquarters on the first floor of Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 490 in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe.[36]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.
Initially, the airline avoided flying to Mexico City because of it being a congested and expensive airport. The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]

History[edit]
The pre-operations phase (founding of the legal entities and setting up of the required infrastructure) started in August 2005 under the name Vuela Airlines. Major initial shareholders of the company were Grupo Televisa (the world's biggest Spanish-language media conglomerate), Inbursa (an insurance company owned by billionaire Carlos Slim), Avianca (then TACA Airlines) and the Discovery Americas Fund. Each of these partners invested 25% of the initial cost of activities, or 100 million USD. On July 2010,[3] it was announced that Televisa and Inbursa had sold their stake in Volaris leaving the ownership of Volaris as follows: Avianca (then TACA Airlines) with Roberto and Maria Cristina Kriete (50%), Investment fund Discovery Americas (over 25%) and Indigo Partners: Fund led by former America West CEO B. Franke.
Ticket sales started on January 12, 2006, and, following the delivery of the airline's first aircraft, the first (non-commercial) flight was operated in February 2006. Scheduled revenue flights were launched on March 13, 2006, with the inaugural flight having been operated from Toluca to Tijuana.

The airline took over several slots that had been owned by now-defunct Mexicana and its subsidiaries MexicanaClick and MexicanaLink, establishing service in September 2010. In March, 2011, it announced that its hub in Toluca would move to Guadalajara.
On June 5, 2012, the airline launched a frequent flyer program called VClub.[4] It is the membership program that provides special fares, offers, last minute travel deals and other perks. Customers can save up to 40% using the VClub membership. On June 6, 2012, PayPal became a payment alternative for the airline, enabling customers to purchase tickets directly from the airline's website.[5] On September 17, 2012, Volaris announced a codeshare partnership with a German airline, Condor. Passengers of Condor are able to fly to more international destinations.[6]
On March 13, 2013, the airline celebrated its seventh anniversary, offering passengers 70% off all flights, it has done this every year since then.[7] Volaris announced the creation of a subsidiary, Volaris Costa Rica, in March 2016.[8][9] The subsidiary, based at Juan Santamaría International Airport in Costa Rican capital San José, started operations in November 2016.[10]
International operations[edit]
In November 2008, Volaris announced a codeshare agreement with US-based low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines.
In April 2009, Volaris announced the start of US-bound flights out of Toluca and Guadalajara (initially to Los Angeles and Oakland) to feed into the hubs of Southwest Airlines. Later on, US-flights were also offered from Zacatecas and Morelia, with Monterrey-Los Angeles and Fresno in planning.
On December 13, 2010, Volaris started services between Chicago/Midway and Guadalajara. It is Volaris' fourth international destination, first international service to a secondary airport and the longest route of Volaris' history. After Mexicana de Aviación's shutdown, Volaris took over many of Mexicana's international destinations and flights from its focus city, Guadalajara.
On February 25, 2011, it was announced that Volaris would acquire Mexicana's destination, Fresno and would begin service on April 14, 2011. Fresno was Volaris' first US destination where it did not partner with Southwest Airlines. The airline began using Guadalajara International Airport as an American gateway hub in late 2011.
Volaris sought permission to fly between Dallas/Fort Worth and Mexico City, along with a number of other U.S.-Mexico routes. Volaris submitted the request on February 3, 2011 and the U.S. Department of Transportation granted approval on February 11.[11] However, Volaris did not launch the service until over four years later, on April 29, 2015, when it began flights between Dallas/Fort Worth and Guadalajara.[12]
Volaris received approval to fly to Southern California's San Diego International Airport on July 12, 2012. Volaris then began non-stop flights between Orlando and Guadalajara from July 14, 2012.[13]
Volaris started service between Sacramento and Guadalajara on November 15, 2012. Volaris then began flights between Denver and Mexico City on December 8, 2012.
On February 22, 2013, Volaris and Southwest stopped codesharing. Southwest decided to focus more on the Mexican market with AirTran Airways, instead of codesharing with Volaris.[14][15]
Volaris began flights between Phoenix and Guadalajara on October 19, 2013.
Volaris began flying to its first destination in Texas at the time, to San Antonio from Guadalajara on December 14, 2013.[16]
Volaris began non-stop flights between Chicago/O'Hare and Mexico City on December 17, 2013.[17] This replaced Volaris' Chicago/Midway-Mexico City flights.
Volaris then began flights between Guadalajara and Ontario, California, a reliever airport in the Greater Los Angeles Area, on April 12, 2014.[18]
Volaris applied to fly Mexicana's former Portland to Guadalajara route. The application was granted and service to Portland began on October 6, 2014.[19]
Volaris began its second destination in Florida, Fort Lauderdale–Hollywood International Airport from Mexico City on December 1, 2014 and then also from Guadalajara on December 4, 2014.[20] The airline has ceased flying to Fort Lauderdale and replaced the route with non-stop flights to Miami from Mexico City and Guadalajara.
Volaris began non-stop flights between Reno–Tahoe International Airport and Guadalajara on December 16, 2014.[21]
Volaris planned to launch service to William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas as soon as the new terminal was completed,[22] but the airline chose to begin flying to Houston-Intercontinental from Guadalajara on March 26, 2015, instead.[23]
Volaris began its first non-stop flights to the Northeastern United States, when it began service between New York-JFK and Guadalajara on July 15, 2015,[24] and on March 1, 2017, started non-stop service between Mexico City and New York-JFK.
In the summer of 2015, Volaris launched its first ever international flights outside the Continental United States; to Guatemala on June 18,[25] to San Juan, Puerto Rico on July 2,[26] and to San José, Costa Rica on September 10.[27]
On July 7, 2016, Volaris began service to Seattle from Guadalajara.[28]
On May 9, 2016 the airline announced it will begin non stop flights between Monterrey and Dallas/Fort Worth; service began on July 8, 2016.[29][30]
Volaris began the first service link between Austin and Guadalajara on August 7, 2016.[31]
Volaris has confirmed it does not plan to fly to Santiago de Chile,[32] and rather focus in the US, Central America and domestic markets, after a local newspaper announced the airline had plans to begin operations in South America.[33]
On March 2017, Volaris began non-stop service between Guadalajara and Milwaukee.
On November 2, 2017, Volairs will offer nonstop service between Guadalajara and San Bernardino.[34]
Corporate affairs[edit]
The airline is headquartered in Santa Fe, Álvaro Obregón, Mexico City.[35] It formerly had its headquarters on the first floor of Prolongación Paseo de la Reforma 490 in Peña Blanca, Santa Fe.[36]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.
