About Us
 
The Garrett State Bank and the City of Garrett were named after John Work Garrett. John's father Robert Garrett had become a successful merchant and shipper in Baltimore and had extensive interests throughout the East. He stepped in to assist the financially embarrassed Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in several ways. Bonds were sold to finance the extension to Wheeling WV and his firm assisted in making various management decisions. Robert Garrett's sons, Henry and John W. Garrett became members of the Board of Directors of the railroad.
 
In 1858 at the age of 38, John W. Garrett became the President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and thereafter devoted most of his time to its operation.
 
Like many Baltimore families, the Garrett family was divided in loyalty between the North and the South. Henry supported the South, and John supported the North. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was a northern railroad, even though its tracks came below the Mason-Dixon Line.
 
Despite the danger from Southern troops, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was kept busy as the only rail line between Washington, D.C. and the northern states. It operated almost continuously despite occasional interruptions and much interference by the Confederate forces.
 
In October 1862, John W. Garrett put a train at the disposal of President Abraham Lincoln, who journeyed to Antietam. He invited Garrett to join him and on October 3, 1862 Matthew Brady photographed Lincoln, General George B. McClellan (who was to run against Lincoln for President in 1864) and John W. Garrett in front of General McClellan's tent on the battlefield.
 
Lincoln paid high tribute to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad for the services rendered during the war and declared that John W. Garrett was "the right arm of the Federal Government in the aid he rendered to the authorities in preventing the Confederates from seizing Washington and securing its retention as the Capital of the loyal States." The decade following the Civil War was one of tremendous economic expansion, especially for the nation's railroads. During the 1870's the rail mileage more then doubled from 44,614 miles to 92,146 miles in 1880.
 
Chicago was rapidly becoming the railroad center of the United States. A railroad without a connection to Chicago could not effectively compete in a national market. Thus John W. Garrett started making plans to expand his railroad westward from Pittsburgh to Chicago. This proved to be impossible, so an alternative plan, which was far less expensive, was made to build a branch from the Newark-Sandusky line straight across the comparatively level areas of northern Ohio and Indiana to Chicago. John W. Garrett is credited with connecting Baltimore and Chicago with this railroad expansion. John W. Garrett died September 26, 1884. 
 
The City of Garrett was founded as a divisional point for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad on the Chicago route. The City was incorporated in 1876 and was laid out by Beverly L. Randolph. Mrs. Randolph named the main street in town after herself and many of the original streets including Keyser, King, Cowen and Quincy were named after officers of the Baltimore Land and Improvement Co. a subsidiary of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. 
Several prominent citizens of Dekalb County formed the Garrett State Bank as a private institution. The Garrett Banking Company opened for business on Saturday April 16, 1892. Our first shareholder was H.N. Coffinberry and the first depositor was Rueben Sawvel. (The Bank continues the tradition of Saturday hours) The bank received a state charter on January 3, 1893, and in 1911 the name was changed to The Garrett State Bank.
 
The bank's first location was a room on the ground floor of the Wagner Opera House on Randolph Street in Garrett. During the early 1900's the bank bought a building and moved to the eastside of Randolph Street. On March 5, 1917 the bank moved into their newly erected Indiana limestone building on the corner of King and Randolph Streets, at the time it was the finest and most modern banking facilities in the entire area. The bank moved into its current Main Office in 1974, the building was erected on the site of the former Dr. Thompson medical office and home on West King Street. The Pine Valley Office was opened for business in 1989 one block North of Dupont Road on Coldwater Road and our Operations Center and South Office were opened in 1995 on south Randolph Street in Garrett.
 
Some notable associates of the Garrett State Bank are Charles W. Camp the first Mayor of Garrett who served as Cashier and President of the bank in its early years and later served as one of the first Banking Commissioners in the State of Indiana. Rev. A. Young a Catholic Priest also served as a board member and a term as the President of the Bank, he is also credited with founding the Sacred Heart Hospital in Garrett. Harry Brown served the bank for more than fifty years most of those as the President and helped the bank survive the banking crisis of the 1930's using conservative principles that are continued today. 
 
Today the Garrett State Bank is a progressive community bank that has a full line of business and personal financial products. We specialize in residential mortgage loans and small to mid sized family owned business loans. Combining common sense decision making with modern products and services allows us to provide our clients the best from the past and present.

Biography[edit]

Robert S. Garrett was born in Baltimore County, Maryland into one of the most prominent and wealthiest families in Maryland. He was the son of Thomas Harrison Garrett and Alice Dickerson Whitridge Garrett.[2] The Garretts were a railroad and financing family; Robert was the grandson of John Work Garrett, (1820-1884), the longtime president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the great-grandson of Robert Garrett, founder of a finance and shipping firm founded in 1819. The younger Robert Garrett studied at Princeton University. He excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate, and was captain of the Princeton track team in both his junior and senior years. Garrett was primarily a shot-putter, though he also competed in the jumping events. When he decided to compete in the first modern Olympic games being revived and held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, Professor William Milligan Sloane suggested he should also try the discus.
They consulted classical authorities to develop a drawing and Garrett hired a blacksmith to make a discus. It weighed nearly 30 pounds (14 kg) and it was impossible to throw any distance, so he gave up on the idea. Garrett paid for his own and three classmates' (Francis Lane (finished third in 100 m), Herbert Jamison (finished second in 400 m), and Albert Tyler (placed second in pole vault) way to Athens to compete in the games. When he discovered that a real discus weighed less than five pounds, he decided to enter the event for fun.
1896 Olympics[edit]

The Greek discus throwers were true stylists. Each throw, as they spun and rose from a classical Discobolus stance, was intended to be beautiful.[attribution needed] Garrett, who seized the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around, the way the hammer is usually thrown, threw the discus with tremendous force. Garrett's first two throws were clumsy. Instead of sailing parallel to the ground, the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts and he joined in the general merriment. His final throw, however, punctuated with a loud grunt, sent the discus sailing 19 centimetres (7.5 in) beyond the second-place throw (by Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos) mark at 29.15 metres (95 ft 8 in).
American spectator Burton Holmes wrote: "All were stupefied. The Greeks had been defeated at their own classic exercise. They were overwhelmed by the superior skill and daring of the Americans, to whom they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen." According to James Connolly, in five of the track and field events won by Americans, they had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall.
Garrett also won the shot put with a distance of 11.22 metres (36 ft 10 in) and finished second in the high jump (tied equally with James Connolly at 1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in)) and second in the long jump (with a jump of 6.00 metres (19 ft 8 in)).
In the 1984 NBC television multi-episode miniseries, "The First Olympics: Athens 1896", Garrett was portrayed by Hunt Block. In the second episode, Garrett was incorrectly portrayed as being a participant in the first Olympic Marathon.[citation needed]
1900 Olympics[edit]
In the 1900 Olympics, Garrett placed third in the shot put and the standing triple jump. His bronze medal in the shot put was unusual, as he refused to compete in the final due to it being held on a Sunday. His qualifying mark was good enough to place him in third. He also competed in the discus throw again, but due to a poorly planned course was unable to set a legal mark as his discus throws all hit trees.
Garrett was also a member of the Tug-of-War team at the 1900 Olympics that was forced to withdraw because three of its six members were engaged in the hammer throw final.
Life after Olympics[edit]
Garrett later became a banker and financier at his grandfather's historic mercantile firm Robert Garrett and Sons in Baltimore. Garrett had an early intensive interest in science, especially in history and archeology, and became an early collector and donator. He helped to organize and finance an archaeological expedition to Syria, led by Dr. John M. T. Finney. From 1932 to 1939, he was involved with the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity both helping to fund the excavations and working on them. Garrett's hobby was collecting medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. In 1942, Garrett donated his collection of more than 11,000 manuscripts to Princeton University, including the "Aksum Scrolls" and sixteen Byzantine Greek manuscripts, containing rare examples of illuminated Byzantine art.
Garrett was for many years an enthusiastic alumnus and served as trustee of Princeton University and also on the governing board of the Baltimore Museum of Art, founded in 1914 by his aunt Mary Elizabeth Garrett, (1857-1915).
Garrett amassed a collection of historical volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C. – A.D. 1900s. He inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett. After his father's sudden death in 1888, Robert spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Facsimiles of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvester (by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949–50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script.
Through a mayoral appointment, Garrett served as the chairman of the city's Public Improvement Commission. He was also largely responsible for bringing the new Boy Scouts of America to Baltimore in 1910.[3] He managed the BSA in Baltimore until his retirement in 1934. In 1919, Garrett gave to the City of Baltimore a tract of land of a city block along East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets in its recently annexed Brooklyn neighborhood in South Baltimore to be used as a public park, which was named in his honor.
Garrett was a leader in the development of public recreational facilities in Baltimore and organized the Public Athletic League which later merged with a similar earlier Children's Playground Association, many of which were privately funded by himself and his friends and colleagues. He was the first chairman of Baltimore City's Bureau of Recreation, and the first chairman of the City's Board of Park Commissioners for the combined Department of Recreation and Parks. Garrett was through much of his life an active member of the National Recreation Association, and was elected its chairman in 1941.
In the Baltimore mayoral campaign of 1947, both the Republican and Democratic nominees promised that, if elected, they would name Garrett as chairman of the City's Department of Recreation and Parks. A devout Presbyterian throughout his life, he was a member of their national convention - the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and was recognized in 1948 as the year's outstanding layperson in the field of religious education by the International Council of Religious Education.
In the realm of civil rights for African-Americans, Garrett was a staunch conservative and opposed then any racial integration of the City's public facilities in the parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, tennis courts and recreation centers, which were coming into increasing controversy as the national civil rights movement expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s. He was later asked to resign from the Board of Park Commissioners when a positive vote for integration was taken.
Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Biography[edit]

Robert S. Garrett was born in Baltimore County, Maryland into one of the most prominent and wealthiest families in Maryland. He was the son of Thomas Harrison Garrett and Alice Dickerson Whitridge Garrett.[2] The Garretts were a railroad and financing family; Robert was the grandson of John Work Garrett, (1820-1884), the longtime president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the great-grandson of Robert Garrett, founder of a finance and shipping firm founded in 1819. The younger Robert Garrett studied at Princeton University. He excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate, and was captain of the Princeton track team in both his junior and senior years. Garrett was primarily a shot-putter, though he also competed in the jumping events. When he decided to compete in the first modern Olympic games being revived and held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, Professor William Milligan Sloane suggested he should also try the discus.
They consulted classical authorities to develop a drawing and Garrett hired a blacksmith to make a discus. It weighed nearly 30 pounds (14 kg) and it was impossible to throw any distance, so he gave up on the idea. Garrett paid for his own and three classmates' (Francis Lane (finished third in 100 m), Herbert Jamison (finished second in 400 m), and Albert Tyler (placed second in pole vault) way to Athens to compete in the games. When he discovered that a real discus weighed less than five pounds, he decided to enter the event for fun.
1896 Olympics[edit]

The Greek discus throwers were true stylists. Each throw, as they spun and rose from a classical Discobolus stance, was intended to be beautiful.[attribution needed] Garrett, who seized the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around, the way the hammer is usually thrown, threw the discus with tremendous force. Garrett's first two throws were clumsy. Instead of sailing parallel to the ground, the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts and he joined in the general merriment. His final throw, however, punctuated with a loud grunt, sent the discus sailing 19 centimetres (7.5 in) beyond the second-place throw (by Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos) mark at 29.15 metres (95 ft 8 in).
American spectator Burton Holmes wrote: "All were stupefied. The Greeks had been defeated at their own classic exercise. They were overwhelmed by the superior skill and daring of the Americans, to whom they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen." According to James Connolly, in five of the track and field events won by Americans, they had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall.
Garrett also won the shot put with a distance of 11.22 metres (36 ft 10 in) and finished second in the high jump (tied equally with James Connolly at 1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in)) and second in the long jump (with a jump of 6.00 metres (19 ft 8 in)).
In the 1984 NBC television multi-episode miniseries, "The First Olympics: Athens 1896", Garrett was portrayed by Hunt Block. In the second episode, Garrett was incorrectly portrayed as being a participant in the first Olympic Marathon.[citation needed]
1900 Olympics[edit]
In the 1900 Olympics, Garrett placed third in the shot put and the standing triple jump. His bronze medal in the shot put was unusual, as he refused to compete in the final due to it being held on a Sunday. His qualifying mark was good enough to place him in third. He also competed in the discus throw again, but due to a poorly planned course was unable to set a legal mark as his discus throws all hit trees.
Garrett was also a member of the Tug-of-War team at the 1900 Olympics that was forced to withdraw because three of its six members were engaged in the hammer throw final.
Life after Olympics[edit]
Garrett later became a banker and financier at his grandfather's historic mercantile firm Robert Garrett and Sons in Baltimore. Garrett had an early intensive interest in science, especially in history and archeology, and became an early collector and donator. He helped to organize and finance an archaeological expedition to Syria, led by Dr. John M. T. Finney. From 1932 to 1939, he was involved with the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity both helping to fund the excavations and working on them. Garrett's hobby was collecting medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. In 1942, Garrett donated his collection of more than 11,000 manuscripts to Princeton University, including the "Aksum Scrolls" and sixteen Byzantine Greek manuscripts, containing rare examples of illuminated Byzantine art.
Garrett was for many years an enthusiastic alumnus and served as trustee of Princeton University and also on the governing board of the Baltimore Museum of Art, founded in 1914 by his aunt Mary Elizabeth Garrett, (1857-1915).
Garrett amassed a collection of historical volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C. – A.D. 1900s. He inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett. After his father's sudden death in 1888, Robert spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Facsimiles of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvester (by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949–50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script.
Through a mayoral appointment, Garrett served as the chairman of the city's Public Improvement Commission. He was also largely responsible for bringing the new Boy Scouts of America to Baltimore in 1910.[3] He managed the BSA in Baltimore until his retirement in 1934. In 1919, Garrett gave to the City of Baltimore a tract of land of a city block along East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets in its recently annexed Brooklyn neighborhood in South Baltimore to be used as a public park, which was named in his honor.

He was later asked to resign from the Board of Park Commissioners when a positive vote for integration was taken.
Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Robert S. Garrett was born in Baltimore County, Maryland into one of the most prominent and wealthiest families in Maryland. He was the son of Thomas Harrison Garrett and Alice Dickerson Whitridge Garrett.[2] The Garretts were a railroad and financing family; Robert was the grandson of John Work Garrett, (1820-1884), the longtime president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the great-grandson of Robert Garrett, founder of a finance and shipping firm founded in 1819. The younger Robert Garrett studied at Princeton University. He excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate, and was captain of the Princeton track team in both his junior and senior years. Garrett was primarily a shot-putter, though he also competed in the jumping events. When he decided to compete in the first modern Olympic games being revived and held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, Professor William Milligan Sloane suggested he should also try the discus.
They consulted classical authorities to develop a drawing and Garrett hired a blacksmith to make a discus. It weighed nearly 30 pounds (14 kg) and it was impossible to throw any distance, so he gave up on the idea. Garrett paid for his own and three classmates' (Francis Lane (finished third in 100 m), Herbert Jamison (finished second in 400 m), and Albert Tyler (placed second in pole vault) way to Athens to compete in the games. When he discovered that a real discus weighed less than five pounds, he decided to enter the event for fun.
1896 Olympics[edit]

The Greek discus throwers were true stylists. Each throw, as they spun and rose from a classical Discobolus stance, was intended to be beautiful.[attribution needed] Garrett, who seized the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around, the way the hammer is usually thrown, threw the discus with tremendous force. Garrett's first two throws were clumsy. Instead of sailing parallel to the ground, the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts and he joined in the general merriment. His final throw, however, punctuated with a loud grunt, sent the discus sailing 19 centimetres (7.5 in) beyond the second-place throw (by Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos) mark at 29.15 metres (95 ft 8 in).
American spectator Burton Holmes wrote: "All were stupefied. The Greeks had been defeated at their own classic exercise. They were overwhelmed by the superior skill and daring of the Americans, to whom they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen." According to James Connolly, in five of the track and field events won by Americans, they had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall.
Garrett also won the shot put with a distance of 11.22 metres (36 ft 10 in) and finished second in the high jump (tied equally with James Connolly at 1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in)) and second in the long jump (with a jump of 6.00 metres (19 ft 8 in)).
In the 1984 NBC television multi-episode miniseries, "The First Olympics: Athens 1896", Garrett was portrayed by Hunt Block. In the second episode, Garrett was incorrectly portrayed as being a participant in the first Olympic Marathon.[citation needed]
1900 Olympics[edit]
In the 1900 Olympics, Garrett placed third in the shot put and the standing triple jump. His bronze medal in the shot put was unusual, as he refused to compete in the final due to it being held on a Sunday. His qualifying mark was good enough to place him in third. He also competed in the discus throw again, but due to a poorly planned course was unable to set a legal mark as his discus throws all hit trees.
Garrett was also a member of the Tug-of-War team at the 1900 Olympics that was forced to withdraw because three of its six members were engaged in the hammer throw final.
Life after Olympics[edit]
Garrett later became a banker and financier at his grandfather's historic mercantile firm Robert Garrett and Sons in Baltimore. Garrett had an early intensive interest in science, especially in history and archeology, and became an early collector and donator. He helped to organize and finance an archaeological expedition to Syria, led by Dr. John M. T. Finney. From 1932 to 1939, he was involved with the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity both helping to fund the excavations and working on them. Garrett's hobby was collecting medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. In 1942, Garrett donated his collection of more than 11,000 manuscripts to Princeton University, including the "Aksum Scrolls" and sixteen Byzantine Greek manuscripts, containing rare examples of illuminated Byzantine art.
Garrett was for many years an enthusiastic alumnus and served as trustee of Princeton University and also on the governing board of the Baltimore Museum of Art, founded in 1914 by his aunt Mary Elizabeth Garrett, (1857-1915).
Garrett amassed a collection of historical volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C. – A.D. 1900s. He inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett. After his father's sudden death in 1888, Robert spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Facsimiles of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvester (by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949–50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script.
Through a mayoral appointment, Garrett served as the chairman of the city's Public Improvement Commission. He was also largely responsible for bringing the new Boy Scouts of America to Baltimore in 1910.[3] He managed the BSA in Baltimore until his retirement in 1934. In 1919, Garrett gave to the City of Baltimore a tract of land of a city block along East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets in its recently annexed Brooklyn neighborhood in South Baltimore to be used as a public park, which was named in his honor.
Garrett was a leader in the development of public recreational facilities in Baltimore and organized the Public Athletic League which later merged with a similar earlier Children's Playground Association, many of which were privately funded by himself and his friends and colleagues. He was the first chairman of Baltimore City's Bureau of Recreation, and the first chairman of the City's Board of Park Commissioners for the combined Department of Recreation and Parks. Garrett was through much of his life an active member of the National Recreation Association, and was elected its chairman in 1941.
In the Baltimore mayoral campaign of 1947, both the Republican and Democratic nominees promised that, if elected, they would name Garrett as chairman of the City's Department of Recreation and Parks. A devout Presbyterian throughout his life, he was a member of their national convention - the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and was recognized in 1948 as the year's outstanding layperson in the field of religious education by the International Council of Religious Education.
In the realm of civil rights for African-Americans, Garrett was a staunch conservative and opposed then any racial integration of the City's public facilities in the parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, tennis courts and recreation centers, which were coming into increasing controversy as the national civil rights movement expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s. He was later asked to resign from the Board of Park Commissioners when a positive vote for integration was taken.
Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland.

Robert S. Garrett was born in Baltimore County, Maryland into one of the most prominent and wealthiest families in Maryland. He was the son of Thomas Harrison Garrett and Alice Dickerson Whitridge Garrett.[2] The Garretts were a railroad and financing family; Robert was the grandson of John Work Garrett, (1820-1884), the longtime president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and the great-grandson of Robert Garrett, founder of a finance and shipping firm founded in 1819. The younger Robert Garrett studied at Princeton University. He excelled in track and field athletics as an undergraduate, and was captain of the Princeton track team in both his junior and senior years. Garrett was primarily a shot-putter, though he also competed in the jumping events. When he decided to compete in the first modern Olympic games being revived and held in Athens, Greece, in 1896, Professor William Milligan Sloane suggested he should also try the discus.
They consulted classical authorities to develop a drawing and Garrett hired a blacksmith to make a discus. It weighed nearly 30 pounds (14 kg) and it was impossible to throw any distance, so he gave up on the idea. Garrett paid for his own and three classmates' (Francis Lane (finished third in 100 m), Herbert Jamison (finished second in 400 m), and Albert Tyler (placed second in pole vault) way to Athens to compete in the games. When he discovered that a real discus weighed less than five pounds, he decided to enter the event for fun.
1896 Olympics[edit]

The Greek discus throwers were true stylists. Each throw, as they spun and rose from a classical Discobolus stance, was intended to be beautiful.[attribution needed] Garrett, who seized the discus in his right hand and swinging himself around and around, the way the hammer is usually thrown, threw the discus with tremendous force. Garrett's first two throws were clumsy. Instead of sailing parallel to the ground, the discus turned over and over and narrowly missed hitting some of the audience. Both foreigners and Americans laughed at his efforts and he joined in the general merriment. His final throw, however, punctuated with a loud grunt, sent the discus sailing 19 centimetres (7.5 in) beyond the second-place throw (by Panagiotis Paraskevopoulos) mark at 29.15 metres (95 ft 8 in).
American spectator Burton Holmes wrote: "All were stupefied. The Greeks had been defeated at their own classic exercise. They were overwhelmed by the superior skill and daring of the Americans, to whom they ascribed a supernatural invincibility enabling them to dispense with training and to win at games which they had never before seen." According to James Connolly, in five of the track and field events won by Americans, they had not had a single day of outdoor practice since the previous fall.
Garrett also won the shot put with a distance of 11.22 metres (36 ft 10 in) and finished second in the high jump (tied equally with James Connolly at 1.65 metres (5 ft 5 in)) and second in the long jump (with a jump of 6.00 metres (19 ft 8 in)).
In the 1984 NBC television multi-episode miniseries, "The First Olympics: Athens 1896", Garrett was portrayed by Hunt Block. In the second episode, Garrett was incorrectly portrayed as being a participant in the first Olympic Marathon.[citation needed]
1900 Olympics[edit]
In the 1900 Olympics, Garrett placed third in the shot put and the standing triple jump. His bronze medal in the shot put was unusual, as he refused to compete in the final due to it being held on a Sunday. His qualifying mark was good enough to place him in third. He also competed in the discus throw again, but due to a poorly planned course was unable to set a legal mark as his discus throws all hit trees.
Garrett was also a member of the Tug-of-War team at the 1900 Olympics that was forced to withdraw because three of its six members were engaged in the hammer throw final.
Life after Olympics[edit]
Garrett later became a banker and financier at his grandfather's historic mercantile firm Robert Garrett and Sons in Baltimore. Garrett had an early intensive interest in science, especially in history and archeology, and became an early collector and donator. He helped to organize and finance an archaeological expedition to Syria, led by Dr. John M. T. Finney. From 1932 to 1939, he was involved with the Committee for the Excavation of Antioch and Its Vicinity both helping to fund the excavations and working on them. Garrett's hobby was collecting medieval and Renaissance manuscripts. In 1942, Garrett donated his collection of more than 11,000 manuscripts to Princeton University, including the "Aksum Scrolls" and sixteen Byzantine Greek manuscripts, containing rare examples of illuminated Byzantine art.
Garrett was for many years an enthusiastic alumnus and served as trustee of Princeton University and also on the governing board of the Baltimore Museum of Art, founded in 1914 by his aunt Mary Elizabeth Garrett, (1857-1915).
Garrett amassed a collection of historical volumes of Western and non-Western manuscripts, fragments, and scrolls, originating from Europe, the Near East, Africa, Asia and Mesoamerica, ca. 1340 B.C. – A.D. 1900s. He inherited his collecting interest from his father, Thomas Harrison Garrett. After his father's sudden death in 1888, Robert spent the following two and a half years traveling extensively with his mother and two brothers, Horatio and John, in Europe and the Near East. During his travels Garrett developed a particular interest in manuscripts and began collecting. He used the text Universal Paleography: or, Facsimiles of Writing of All Nations and Periods by J. B. Silvester (by Sir Frederic Madden, London, 1949–50) as his guide for collecting primary examples of every known type of script.
Through a mayoral appointment, Garrett served as the chairman of the city's Public Improvement Commission. He was also largely responsible for bringing the new Boy Scouts of America to Baltimore in 1910.[3] He managed the BSA in Baltimore until his retirement in 1934. In 1919, Garrett gave to the City of Baltimore a tract of land of a city block along East Patapsco Avenue, between Second and Third Streets in its recently annexed Brooklyn neighborhood in South Baltimore to be used as a public park, which was named in his honor.
Garrett was a leader in the development of public recreational facilities in Baltimore and organized the Public Athletic League which later merged with a similar earlier Children's Playground Association, many of which were privately funded by himself and his friends and colleagues. He was the first chairman of Baltimore City's Bureau of Recreation, and the first chairman of the City's Board of Park Commissioners for the combined Department of Recreation and Parks. Garrett was through much of his life an active member of the National Recreation Association, and was elected its chairman in 1941.
In the Baltimore mayoral campaign of 1947, both the Republican and Democratic nominees promised that, if elected, they would name Garrett as chairman of the City's Department of Recreation and Parks. A devout Presbyterian throughout his life, he was a member of their national convention - the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, and was recognized in 1948 as the year's outstanding layperson in the field of religious education by the International Council of Religious Education.
In the realm of civil rights for African-Americans, Garrett was a staunch conservative and opposed then any racial integration of the City's public facilities in the parks, playgrounds, swimming pools, tennis courts and recreation centers, which were coming into increasing controversy as the national civil rights movement expanded in the late 1940s and 1950s. He was later asked to resign from the Board of Park Commissioners when a positive vote for integration was taken.
Garrett died on April 25, 1961, in Baltimore, Maryland.
