Rusty Shelton: Founder & CEO
 

Rusty Shelton first spoke at Harvard on the changing world of PR and marketing at the age of 23. Today, as Founder and CEO of Shelton Interactive, he works alongside the company’s clients to start conversations that matter by providing on-target vision in an often-confusing new media environment. Founded in 2010, Shelton Interactive is a full-service digital agency that integrates design, social media, website development and PR—services that are normally handled by multiple agencies—under one roof. In 2014 Shelton Interactive landed on the Austin Business Journal’s Fast 50 List, which ranks companies in the Austin area based on three-year revenue growth. The company was ranked #15 in the under $10 Million category. In addition to working with leading businesses and brands in Austin, Texas, and beyond – Amazon, Kellogg School of Management, Chicken Soup for the Soul, Harvard Medical School and others – SheltonInteractive led digital strategy for some of the biggest bestsellers of the past few years, including The One Thing, by Gary Keller and Jay Papasan, The Confidence Code, by Claire Shipman and Katty Kay, Big Data, by Kenneth Cukier and Viktor Mayer-Schonberger, One Thousand Gifts, by Ann Voskamp, Take the Stairs, by Rory Vaden, How The World Sees You, by Sally Hogshead, Eat Move Sleep, by Tom Rath, Winning From Within, by Erica Ariel Fox, Anything by Jennie Allen and many, many others. Shelton Interactive is also proud to have a strategic partnership with the leading business book and nonfiction PR firm in the country, Cave Henricks Communications. An NSA speaker, Rusty speaks regularly around the country on the changing world of public relations, including speaking at SXSW Interactive in 2012 on the topic of “Discoverability and the Future of PR.” In addition, he has been a faculty member at the Harvard Medical School Department of Continuing Education’s Publishing Course for the past 10 years. His perspective on branding, digital marketing and the changing world of PR have been included in coverage from numerous top media outlets, including BBC, Forbes, Austin American-Statesman and many others. Prior to founding Shelton Interactive, Rusty started his career right out of college with a leading book publicity agency where he became the managing director at the age of 26. He left the firm in early 2010, but during Shelton’s three years as managing director, he oversaw campaigns for more than half of the firm’s 30 bestsellers. An avid Texas Longhorns fan, he sits on the University of Texas Texas Exes PR Committee, where he leads the subcommittee on digital strategy. He is also a proud member of Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) in Austin. He lives just west of Austin with his wife, Paige, two young sons, Luke & Brady and their very rowdy young black lab, Charlie.

About - Rusty Shelton















































 






 


About		




 

 Rusty Shelton first spoke at Harvard on the changing world of PR and marketing at the age of 23.
He is the co-author (alongside Barbara Cave Henricks) of Mastering the New Media Landscape: Embrace the Micromedia Mindset (Berrett-Koehler, 2016), which debuted at #2 on the Austin American-Statesman bestseller list and is endorsed by David Meerman Scott, Tom Rath, Sally Hogshead and many others.
Rusty’s commentary has been featured in Forbes, Inc. Magazine, Wharton, Huff Post and many other top media outlets.
After successfully growing Shelton Interactive into one of the nation’s most respected digital marketing agencies, the company was acquired by Advantage Media Group in early 2016, and he is now Senior Marketing Strategist.
Shelton Interactive was founded in 2010 with a forward-thinking model – creating a full-service digital marketing and public relations agency that integrated design, social media, website development and PR—services that are normally handled by multiple agencies—under one roof. In its five years of existence, the company handled the launch of more than 30 New York Times & Wall Street Journal bestsellers and represented some of the world’s most recognized authorities, including Capt. “Sully” Sullenberger, Tom Rath & many others.
In 2014 Shelton Interactive landed on the Austin Business Journal’s Fast 50 List, which ranks companies in the Austin area based on three-year revenue growth. The company was ranked #15 in the under $10 Million category. The company was also named one of the nation’s top 10 social media marketing agencies in 2014 and 2015 by research agency Clutch.
An active NSA speaker, Rusty speaks regularly at top conferences and leads workshops for businesses of every size. He has spoken at EO Alchemy, SXSW Interactive, FPA (Financial Planning Conference), Million Dollar Round Table (MDRT) and has been a faculty member at the Harvard Medical School Publishing Course for the past 10 years.
An avid Texas Longhorns fan, he sits on the University of Texas Texas Exes PR Committee and is a proud member of Entrepreneurs’ Organization (EO) in Austin.
He lives just west of Austin in Spicewood with his wife, Paige and three children (Luke, Brady & Sadie) and their very rowdy black lab, Charlie. Rusty loves to play golf, fish and coach his sons’ sports teams.
ADVANTAGE MEDIA GROUP
Following the acquisition of Shelton Interactive, Rusty is now President of Advantage Marketing, the agency arm of Advantage Media Group, the Business Growth Company™.

Praise
“Rusty and his team have a keen understanding of the most critical components of the social media web, and more importantly, a talent for helping reach our audience in an authentic and incredibly creative fashion. They craft strategies that “stick” and have long-lasting impact, and they are masters of integrating traditional PR with the world of the web. Perhaps, most important, the style at Shelton – everyone on the team not only knew our work as well as we did, but was also responsive, friendly and easy to work with. Thank you!”
 Claire Shipman ABC News Journalist and New York Times Bestselling Author
“There are a million people online who promise to help you with buzz, hype and promotion. Currently, all it takes to be considered a ‘social media expert,’ is to own a Twitter account. But Shelton Interactive are operating at a different level. Their work and real expertise were critical to the successful launch of my latest book ‘Do Over.’ I highly recommend them!”
