Why choose The Bancorp?            
We are a trailblazer in financial services and one of the few companies in the world specialized in providing private label banking and technology solutions to meet the unique business needs of non-bank companies.
 




75,000,000+
prepaid cards in U.S. distribution

100+
private-label non-bank partners

$232 BILLION
combined annual processing volume


You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.

Our ability to make unparalleled capital investments in talent and infrastructure, combined with our commitment to support only the highest quality programming, is helping us meet and exceed the increasingly rigorous demands of regulators and clients alike. Comprised of some of the most respected leaders in the payments industry, our leadership team brings decades of experience and a history of innovation to each and every project.

 Merchant Services
            









A leading payments processor licensed by Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover®, Star®, NYCE®, PULSE®, Maestro®, Accell®, AFFM® and UnionPay®, we make it possible for growing mid-market companies to take advantage of today’s most advanced, seamless payment processes without incurring the expense or demands of chartering their own bank. As a voting member of NACHA and the Electronics Transactions Association, we are an important part of the decision-making process that affects industry policy. Our working relationships are long-term and almost exclusively with third party agents, who value us for our expertise in providing large and small businesses with extraordinarily stable and efficient payment alternatives. The standards we set are high – we are extremely selective in determining for which merchants we will provide processing services. Because of this strict selection process, we can more readily deliver the greater efficiencies which lead to greater profitability for our partners.

 ACH Processing
            









Innovative, flexible payment solutions that offer an ease of use, security and accuracy – that’s what we provide every day. Our outstanding technical infrastructure, coupled with our proven sophistication in financial services, enables us to achieve an uncommonly high level of service delivery. Our superiority has been achieved through the mastering of ACH processing technologies and administration for two markets in particular: payroll transaction processing and electronic bill payment processing between businesses and their clients and customers. The reliability and speed of our platforms (99.999+% uptime), coupled with highly malleable processing submission options, always-available expert support and best-of-class loss prevention have earned us the recognition as the ideal payments acceptance resource.

 Emerging Payments

Our outstanding technical infrastructure, coupled with our proven sophistication in financial services, enables us to achieve an uncommonly high level of service delivery. Look closely and you will see us working alongside some of the leading game changers such as Google Wallet, PayPal and ApplePay.

Why choose The Bancorp?            
We are a trailblazer in financial services and one of the few companies in the world specialized in providing private label banking and technology solutions to meet the unique business needs of non-bank companies.
 




75,000,000+
prepaid cards in U.S. distribution

$232 BILLION
combined annual processing volume


You may not have heard a lot about us. And that’s by design.

From the start, we’ve spent most of our time and efforts behind the scenes, putting the companies who work with us - and their goals - first. We’ve remained in the background, offering them the guidance, innovative thinking, and operational support they need to succeed. Whether expanding business, increasing profitability, bringing existing financial products to new audiences or creating entirely new financial products and services –take a close look behind some of the world’s most successful companies: that’s where you’ll find The Bancorp.
Today we’ve grown far from our roots as a branchless commercial bank to become a true financial services leader, offering private-label banking and technology solutions to non-bank companies ranging from entrepreneurial start-ups to those on the Fortune 500. Over the years, our strategic focus on a handful of high-growth financial service sectors such as Payments, Health Benefit Banking, Institutional Banking, and Specialized Lending has resulted in tremendous organizational growth and widespread recognition. We now comprise a diverse team that includes bankers, business strategists, fintech experts, software developers, program managers, regulatory advisors, information security specialists and category thought leaders, all eager to provide their wide-ranging expertise in new and innovative ways. No other organization does what we do. And no other organization delivers what we can deliver.

                Only one problem with this card.  They lie about being able to load the card via PayPal...you can NOT load this card using PayPal! The PayPal rep said they only load their own prepaid PayPal debit cards. The Rushcard needs to stop advertising this on their website it is false advertising!

                Rush cards fraud department didn't flag unauthorized transactions on my account. Total of 8 transactions happened on my account February 24 2017. I contacted them immediately when I realized my card waa compromised. They told me to file a dispute form. 4 days holding on the phone for more than 30 mins at a time no one contacted me from the fusupite department or from cuaomtwr service to follow up on my complaints. I've spoken to numerous supervisors and representatives requesting someone follow up and contact me but it seems the automer is responsible for following up. I fianlly filed at 11:30 pm on march 6th. They told me 5-7 business days to receive my debit card in the mail. Then tried to mail me a dispute form. No one took into consideration how urgent this matter is. The total amount for unauthorized transactions is $1502 and some change. That's a lot of money for rush card to have taken and approved of but has no records of how it was withdrawn from my account. They told me wait 5-10 business days and rush card will refund your unauthorized transactions until the full investigation was over. That could take up to 45-90 days. I've contacted an attorney and plan to file a lawsuits against rush card for allowing the transactions to happened , for forcing the responsibility onto the customer, to wait 7 business days for me to access any of my funds,and when the dispute solution was finailized it was up to the customer to contact rush card and find out the results. I haven't been able to pay my rent or purchase a vehicle for my job. This has limited me to the amount of food I put on my table fory son. Its also made me file for extensions on my utility bills due to not having these funds available. I've been thrown around from department to department and no one can answer the question of how did these transactions happen ? I bought a coffee just before 8 am on February 24th. Went to work and on my lunch break I saw $1500 and some change was taken from me. From me !!! Merchant is in Cumberland new Jersey. I've never made any purchases there from the time I opened my account in 2009. Not only did rush card not flag the unauthorized transactions as they happened, I didn't receive any text messages confirming this was deducted. I signed up and have been signed up for alerts for every transaction made and that morning at 9:30 am of February 24th 2017 I did not receive one message to my phone. That's a clear sign that they were unauthorized and even more rush card claims it was an ATM. So every ATM has a camera. Ive recorded conversations for my own records, ive screen shoted my account information the day it happend.ive noted every tine and day i spoke with a rush card member. Everytime i was denied to speak with a supervisor i wrote it down, when they tried to charge me $4.95 for a replacement card , or $30 for expediting my debit card to me, ive taken all notes for the law suit.I have confirmation in writing from mubemplpyer that I was at work at the time of the withdrawals. My purse was in my desk where I keep my wallet. Someone gotten my card information and pin number. But its rush cards responsibility to protect their customers and i was not protected. This isn't the first complaint I have with rush card but this time I plan to file a lawsuit. I will be closing my account and told my 4 friends I referred to the company, in addition to two of my faimly members. We will be closing total of 7 accounts with rush card. I spoke with them finally today and they told me the dispute was finalized. The bank did not feel my transactions were unauthorized. !!!!!!! Absolutely unacceptable. Told me to write a letter asking if they can re open my investigation. Which I will be doing. I have an email address to the corporate office and I plan to include all the supervisors I spoke to in my claim as well. The lack of empathy remorse or inconsideration will result me to close my account. I will get my money back if I have to take the further up the chain. I am terribly disappointed in the process in which a customer has to go through in order to revieve or even access their own funds.… read more

		I'm going through the same thing! My card was lost and someone found it and made purchases. I spoke to one of the merchants and they informed me to make a police report NOT rushcard smh I'm glad I made one cuz they closed my dispute saying they found no issue and they called merchants and they said charges were valid and that's bull!

                This is the worst financial institution I have ever dealt with. I had a pension that was rolled over from my employer where they opened a safe harbor IRA for me and it has been a nightmare. They take out all kinds of fees and when I decided to close out my account, they promised that it would take 20 days to close out and to receive the check in the mail because if it was ACH, it would be an additional fee. It has been two months and my account is still not closed out and the representative has given me over four excuses as to why its not closed out. STAY AWAY AND BANK ELSE WHERE!… read more

                I would recommend staying away from The Bancorp.  By contractural arrangement, they owed me a half point referral fee on a rather large business acquisition loan. They first said they had wired the money into my bank account. They hadn't. Then the first check they sent me bounced. Now they've sent me a replacement check which they say is good. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

                While the American Express prepaid card has much lower fees than most prepaid cards, they do not offer a bill payment service which renders the card useless as an alternative to a checking account. Also they are not affiliated with an ATM network which means that the combination of Amex's ATM fees together with the fee charged by the owner/operator of the ATM can make the Amex card a very costly card for someone that needs frequent ATM access.Here is more information on the Amex prepaid debit card:https://wallethub.com/d/american-express-prepaid-card-569c/… read more

                TheDark Child - Actually neither Suze's prepaid debit card or ANY other prepaid card help you build your credit in any sort of manner! It is actually unfortunate that Suze markets her card in such a misleading way...The only thing that Orman's prepaid card does is that it shares purchase, payment and other transaction information with TransUnion (one of the major credit bureaus) so that they can study the correlation between that information and the information that is currently included in most consumer credit reports. In other words it is a study that will yield NO changes to a consumer's credit report and credit score. Maybe two years after the study is complete something actionable might emerge.Bottom line is that if you need to build or rebuild your credit score stay away from Suze Orman's prepaid card or ANY other prepaid card for that matter. Just apply for a secured credit card:https://wallethub.com/credit-cards/secured/… read more

                The absolute worse customer service in this country. They claim they never receive anything via fax, I faxed the same paper work 3 times they claim there are still missing documents. You can't understand the foreign people on the phone. You can't speak to an American. They do everything they can to not release your money. This company is garbage and complete Bs. There are over 170+ complaints to the BBB in the last 3 years with only a fraction of them closed. This is not an accredited BBB business. They read a scripted card just like every other call center. You have to yell at them and ask for a supervisor to get anywhere. I asked for a supervisor 5 times before ever getting one. This company needs to be put out of business… read more

                Their banking system was great around 1-2 years ago but recently they are getting worst every day, if you contact them and send them message, they use to be answer you right away, but not it take 3-5 days until they reach you back.Not to mention compare to other online bank such Ally, Capital One 360, they don't offer you any interest.At least on Capital One 360 let you deposit money from ATM, they don't do anything to help you.… read more

                The PayPal Prepaid MasterCard’s negatives unfortunately far outweigh its positive attributes for most use cases. First and foremost are its $4.95 monthly fee and $1.95 ATM withdrawal fee, which promise to make the account quite expensive to maintain, especially if you often need cash. And to add insult to injury, if your card is ever lost or stolen, you’ll have to pay $5.95 for a replacement.One of the only times this card would make sense is if you’re very popular and don’t mind saddling your friends and family with a mediocre prepaid card. You will receive $5 for each person you refer who opens an account and loads at least $10. That person will get $5, too, but few of us are situated for this sort of prepaid-card Ponzi scheme.For more information on this offer, you can check out our full PayPal Prepaid MasterCard review: http://wallethub.com/edu/paypal-prepaid-mastercard-review/25973/ .… read more

                I have had Rushcard a year and a half now, and I always hated the fact that whenever I needed large sums of money off my card it was an impossible feat and the customer service sucks. The only positive is the pay 2 days earlier, which is good and even with opening a new bank account I still had a portion of my pay check going to Rushcard for this reason. But after today I'm done with them. As stated it's been a year and a half that I have had this card, but this morning I get a text saying that my card is blocked. I called in to unblock it, they say my card has been compromised, with no explanation as to what the compromise was. Then they say in order to remove the block I need to send a copy of my social security card, ID, and bill. Now if this was a new application that's one thing, but to hold my money hostage for a week for me to send in verification documents to verify I am the one that has had this card for 18 months is just outrageous. And of course this comes right after my pay day so I have no choice but to comply or lose 2 weeks pay, but I plan on closing this card and seeking another alternative. This is simply ridiculous, I would never recommend them.… read more

                My son was taking his first trip away, and I did not want to give him my credit card. I wanted to limit what he could spend and teach him about budgeting and also monitor his purchases online. I wanted to use a reputable company and decided on using a PayPal PrePaid card, which I purchased and funded at a local Walgreens. I registered the card online and at first ran into an issue from having an old card. I called customer service and they resolved the issue immediately. Overall I was extremely happy with my purchase.… read more

                I work freelance and get paid through PayPal, so the prepaid PayPal card is awesome! I don't have to wait 3-5 days to transfer money from my PayPal account to my separate bank account - I have access to it directly and immediately. PayPal makes everything easy and hassle-free. I love how everything is done online and have never been somewhere that wouldn't/couldn't take Mastercard. I highly recommend it.

                This company pretended to go through a major shut down just to steal its customers money. I loaded my money onto this card october 12 and it is now 12/22 and still have yet to see any of my money. Then they gave out 25.00 credits to people but I didnt get that nor did I get my money. I submitted a complaint via phone several times, email, and online still no resolution. when I checked my account to see if a dispute was even opened nothing was there. They never opened a dispute. I have several email from them saying they would then saying to call in but when i do they put me on hold for hours and never return to the phone. I loaded my money onto this card at a CVS. I contacted CVS who contacted Rushcard and never received a response. CVS and I both sent in proof that I loaded the money and still nothing. I am so done with this company Russell Simmons makes being a black owned business look really bad. Never again. I would rather give my money to these real banks and Netspend than Rushcard.… read more

                This business card is too good , have many offers. Most of the other providers could not provide the offers and cannot compete with this PEX. Very much satisfied with this card some of the offers are Best Replacement for your Business Credit Or Debit Card.Instantly fund employee purchases.Gain 24/7 control over where and how much employees spend.Save money - no surprise interest charges or overdraft fees.

Well it was good while it lasted but time for an bank account for me....AT LEAST I KNOW MY FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE ON MY ACCURATE PAYDAY GOODBYE MR SIMMONS… read more

                Rushcard is a scam. They have just ripped me off for over $600.00.. Cannot even get customer service on the phone. All they do is keep hanging up on me. I've contacted my lawyer,local news and FDIC. I will be taking them to court. Do not get this card.

                I'm sitting with a family member right now. He was not sent a replacement card before his expired. Now they won't allow him access to his money or send his replacement card without sending $30.00 to Rush Card for their mistakes. What a ripoff. People please don't use the RushCard.

                I currently have an account with Simple Bank. They are an internet only bank but have many great features that make them my favorite above traditional banks. They have no fees first of all. Second, you can just take a picture of your check and it will upload right away. There is a downfall of no cash deposits. To solve this, you can just purchase a money order and take a picture of it. Transfers are fast and they have great customer support. There is never a worry that I will not get help. They also include a cool money clip rubber band device when you get your card.… read more

                I had some trepidation about using an all-online bank for checking. The validation process took a day or so, and the check card took almost two weeks to arrive. Sort of understandable, since the only way they make money is if you have money sitting in your account, racking up interest. No fees so far, even with the piddling balance I keep in there. The interface is friendly, and modern-looking, very different from other banks. Very much mobile-friendly, along the lines of ExpressCoin. Simple Checking is a keeper. Chase who?… read more

                I have loved Simple Checking. They have been super-quick on resolving issues, and their online interface is very easy to use. I love the goal setting aspect of long-term savings, and the ability to set money aside painlessly. Their bill pay service is simple to use, and it is easy to send money to friends and family without too much pain.

                I have had some issues with other banks and their checking accounts in the past, their fault and my own, so when a friend of mine told me about Simple Checking from the Bancorp Bank, I thought it sounded way too good to be true! Turns out that I actually had one of the Bancorp Bank's prepaid debit cards, so I knew that it was a respectable bank. It's never done me wrong and it continues to delight me and make up for all those others banks from the past! I praise God for Simple Checking from The Bancorp Bank!… read more

                I got this card because I needed something to get direct depot to from my job. I figured I'd give this card a shot. So far, I am very pleased with it. I have no problems getting my deposits in a timely manner. I can use it anywhere, and the fees are pretty reasonable. My transfer come through pretty quickly. There are some hidden fees, so make sure you read the fine print. I have only had one problem where I had to call customer service, but it was my own fault for the problem. They treated me with respect and I wasn't on hold long before my problem was resolved.… read more

                Simple bank is my newest checking account and by far the best yet. I really like it because it's name speaks for my experience with them; everything is really simple. My checking account is clear and easy to read, it's a free account with no hidden fees, and I have been able to transfer money to and from my savings account with no fees. Also, when transferring money from another financial institution, the longest that I ever had to wait was 2 days. I have Wells Fargo and Woodforest bank as well and Simple beats both banks in my opinion. The only downside to Simple is that it is only online so there are no branches to go to.… read more

                I ordered this card thinking it would be great for the work I did. It has Direct Deposit so I thought it would be great. One needs to read the fine print well before activating a card like this. First off, they charge you a $9.95 activation fee. Then, when you use your card for purchased they take a $1.00 off each time you make a purchase (they will take up to $10.00 and then stop). However I have researched different cards, and most of them have some "hidden" fees. This card does cost some money though!!!… read more

                After hearing about simple I was a little skeptical if it was actually a real thing. But more or less I have not been upset with them at all. The people who work there are always helpful. I also like the mobile application how much simpler it is in regards to having to go to a bank and deal with that hassle. One major thing is the fees there is none. Having no fee is what brought me to simple and I am going to continue using them.… read more

                I have a Paypal Prepaid Debit card for about 9 months now and I really like it. I use it everyday. I get paid through Paypal and it's so easy so transfer the money to your Debit Card. You have instant access to the money. I also like the feature that your card doesn't get declined when you're in a store and the amount you have to pay is a little more than what you have on your card. It doesn't get declined for a few dollars.… read more

                I have recently just signed up and recieved my RushCard in the mail. It took less than a week to get it. The only serious issue I had with the card is the $9.95 activation fee. I feel that it was very misleading. However, I should have taken more time to read the fine print. I think all of us are guilty of this one time or another. It said it would only be a $3.95 activation fee, however when I added funds to my account the bank deducted $9.95. This I can live with, because there is no monthly fee, as other cards have the fee. Next time I will read the fine print more carefully!… read more

                I've had my card for about 5 years and have not been able to use it. The first free call to activate my APPROVEDCARD was like speaking to a foreign telemarketing hub of cubicles where you could hear everyone else talking on phones in the background. I barely got a word in before he told me "This is your one free call" and then he hung up on me. I never called back but I did go to the website and I did activate my APPROVEDCARD but was never able to make any transactions OTHER THAN LOADING IT. THANKS FOR NOTHING APPROVEDCARD. PS...You should make zero stars an option for rating the APPROVEDCARD.… read more

                After being frustrated with constant fees from Chase for simply not having a million dollars on hand at all times, I switched to Simple in hopes that I could trade in convenience for free checking. Turns out, I didn't have to trade in for "free" at all! If anything, using Simple has been more convenient than any prior banking experience. The Mobile App is available on many platforms, it's easy to use, and the customer service response time is unprecedented. Not only did my one fraudulent purchase get immediately removed, card cancelled & new one shipped over CHRISTMAS, but the agent working with me responded to my gratitude with an Adventure Time .gif. That's just clever, and really bodes well for a young company appealing to the Internet Age demographic. I've used it for many applications now, and have yet to come across an issue. Now for them to open up a savings option with accrued interest, I'd be golden.… read more

                I love Simple. Everything about them is amazing. They have an awesome mobile app, real people to call, and great tech support through the app. You can block and unblock your card, without having to order a new one. So if you lose and then find the card, you can just reactivate it in the app.The only major issue I’ve ever had with them was when my card number was stolen, and I had to order a new card to my new address. I had to send a bunch of verifying documents to them through the app, but they were awesome about getting everything taken care of, and even though the process was annoying, I felt good knowing that they took verifying my identity seriously.… read more

                I had my prepaid card for about 6 months now. I work online now so it was completely convenient. I found the easiest way to transfer money online is through Paypal. I have a few companies I work for so it was easy to send through paypal with no problems and it has an option to set up a savings account. It is also a great way to transfer money when I use Ebay and easily transfer my money from amazon payments to my bank account, which I utilize that feature Paypal has and I would recommend anybody working from home to get theirs setup to save hassle. I had a few problems with withdrawing money from the atm and fees I just called customer service and they took care it very fast leaving me without any more problems.… read more

                I've been using this bank since about July '14 and I really like it. I never have to visit a branch, my pay checks are direct deposited and my money is available with no effort on my part. There is a photo check deposit feature for putting paper checks and payments into your account. The only down side is, if you wish to put cold hard cash into your account you have to purchase a money order and deposit it with the photo feature as they're an online bank. I still love them and this has never made me want to go to a new bank as I rarely have plain cash to deposit. I use this account to send money, receive my checks and payments, and for bills/recurring payments. I have another account elsewhere for my "spending" anyway.… read more

                I started out with The Bancorp Bank when I was in college and haven't looked back. I don't pay any fees and there's no minimum balance. They send me text alerts that I've customized to meet my needs and customer service is excellent. The only drawback is that there aren't many convenient ATMs in my area, so I have to keep ATM visits to a minimum; to compensate for the lack of availability, The Bancorp Bank reimburses me for one foreign ATM transaction a month. I highly recommend.… read more

How Do Banks Work?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													The manner in which banks operate might seem like a rather basic topic, but given how complex financial markets have become in recent years, it’s helpful to revisit the fundamental simplicity of the industry.

Having money exactly when you need to it—and earning income on it when you don’t—is a problem as old as money itself. Banks exist to solve that problem, and have served as an intermediary between savers and borrowers since the Italian Renaissance, the Crusades, or even earlier, depending on which historians you consult.

More specifically, banks lend the funds deposited into savings accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) to other customers, who repay the money with interest over time. Depositors entrust their money to banks for two reasons: 1) banks offer safe-keeping, borne from FDIC insurance; and 2) banks pay interest on deposits, allowing funds to grow over time. Banks, in turn, make money, by charging a higher rate of interest on their loans than what they pay on deposits. Banks can have other sources of revenue as well, including investments, fees on various services, and commissions on the sale of financial products such as mutual funds and insurance.

In addition to serving as a vector for borrowing and lending, banks play a central role in a number of other financial mechanisms. For example, banks process payments between buyers and sellers and they exchange foreign currencies. Banks also carry out governmental monetary policy by increasing or decreasing the amount of money they keep in reserve.
											

How Do I Choose a Bank?
By: Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO
													When it comes to selecting a bank, the options can be overwhelming. In past generations, it was common to choose whichever institution was to your home or office, or to be lured in by special prizes such as a free toaster. These days, you might just as easily do business with a bank that’s located across the country or with an online-only bank that has no branch offices at all. Special offers also are less likely to be small kitchen appliances and more likely to be perks such as free checking, introductory interest rates, or a lump of cash to jumpstart your savings account.

But before you jump on the bank with the biggest name or the flashiest offers, take some time to identify how you’re most likely to use your account and which features are most important to you.

Do you need a brick-and-mortar location? You may find yourself in need of a safe-deposit box. Or if questions arise, you may be the kind of person who is most comfortable with face-to-face communication. If you need access to a real building staffed by live people, prioritize your bank’s location and hours.

Bankers’ hours are notoriously short, and if your workday overlaps them completely, you might want to choose a bank that’s close to your office rather than your home, so that you can slip in at lunchtime. Or you might want to look for a bank with better hours.

Are you a technophile? You may find access to better interest rates and fee structures by opting for an online-only bank or bank account. By the same token, you may be able to minimize fees by opting for paperless statements, keeping tabs on your account balance electronically, and using mobile apps to locate ATMs that are within your network.

These are great opportunities, and you should take advantage of banks that offer them…if you are likely to use them. If your inbox is full of unread email notifications and your phone is loaded with unused apps, it helps to be realistic. Read through the fine print, understand the fees and penalties, and decide whether they work for your lifestyle.

Do you travel abroad extensively? International financial transactions have never been easier or less labor-intensive. And while most banks charge special fees for international debit card transactions and ATM withdrawals, others have been able to pass the savings along to their customers.

If you’re a frequent international traveler, it definitely pays to open one of the various no foreign transaction fee credit cards that are on the market.  Not only will this enable you to avoid the industry-standard 3% international surcharge, but you’ll also save a lot of money on currency conversion since Visa and Mastercard offer much better rates than bank branches or airport kiosks.  You should also look into getting a checking account that charges for neither international debit card use, nor foreign ATM withdrawals.

Is a sense of responsibility to the community important to you when it comes to banking? Since the global financial crisis of 2008, the reputation of many banks has suffered a black eye. But the banking industry is not a monolithic entity. Many consumers who are concerned about issues like local development, fair lending, and executive salaries have turned to small community and cooperative banks as well as credit unions for their banking needs.

These institutions may be less likely to offer all the bells and whistles of their larger cousins, but their mission is to provide the immediate community with the best products and services possible.  They’re worth a look at the very least.
											

What Does It Mean to Be FDIC Insured?
By: John Kiernan, Personal Finance Editor
													If your bank is FDIC insured, any money you put into a deposit account, along with any earned interest, will be returned to you, even if your bank fails. There are limits, of course. Insurance coverage tops out at $250,000 per depositor, per institution—not per account, as some people assume. That means if you have $125,000 in a money market account and another $125,000 in a CD at the same bank, you’ll want to open a new account at a different bank before depositing any more money in order to make everything is insured.

It’s important to note that FDIC insurance covers deposit accounts only, that is, checking, savings, CDs, and money market accounts. Other investment vehicles that banks sometimes provide, such as annuities, life insurance, and mutual funds (including money market funds), are not insured.

Most banks and thrifts (also known as savings and loan institutions), are FDIC insured, but a few are not. By law, those that are must display the FDIC logo prominently on the bank premises and in written materials. If you don’t see the logo, or if you have any doubts, ask about coverage. Credit unions are not covered by the FDIC, but they do have an insurance program of their own, sponsored by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  As is the case with banks, this provides coverage for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution.

The FDIC, which stands for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, was founded by the U.S. government in 1933 in response to the widespread bank failures of the Great Depression. FDIC insurance is deemed necessary because bank failures can initiate a devastating domino effect involving consumers, commerce, other banks, and the overall economy. And one of the hard lessons of the 1920s and 1930s was that even healthy banks can fail when skittish customers withdraw all their deposits en masse. Deposit insurance gives depositors the assurance necessary to keep their money in the bank, even in the face of frightening economic and financial news. In that way, it protects not only the consumer, but also the banks and the economy.

Depending on your needs for a checking account, like direct deposit or checks, I suggest letting your credit cool off and open what's called a simple card account. It does require proof of identity, no fees, allows direct deposit, and is a Visa cash, not credit card.Also, I'd suggest talking to a credit union about an account, because their systems run checks - it is not the same as a traditional bank check system.

I've been in same position and resorted to doing a title loan, but not your usual one. Look into a company called New Deal. They provide title loans assistance but, the % is wal less and since collateral is involved, they'll be more willing. It goes on credit as a loan, and also helps improve your credit score with each on time payment

Walmart had something called bluebird checking and you get a debit card also. There are NO Fees. You cannot get overdrafts like I have at Wells Fargo and Chase when I specifically wrote and told them no on overdrafting. I would deposit the money before opening the next business day but those monster banks were so greedy making it like they did me a favor charging me 34.00 and usually for less than 34.00 over and I had the money in by the next business day. Also Amex Serve charges very little depending on your habits and which plan you select. As another mentioned, credit unions are another good place to call and nowadays are more lax on who can open accounts. Go to the social worker at the hospital and see if he/she can help. They sometimes have extended payment plans, partial forgiveness, low interest, etc. for such things. The billing office probably won't help you so if the are bothering you tell them you are working with the social worker to get it paid. I don't know if you qualify for Medicaid within 3 mo of the illness but health and human resources in your state would be able to help you then. But you would have to have very low income and less than 2,000 in resources not counting your house or car. There are other agencies in your city/county that may also help. One place to call is 211.… read more

...and so there is this checking acc. from Wells Fargo called "Everyday Checking".Here is how it works: You open an account that consists of a Savings Acc. with some minimal starting amount (in my case opening was $100) and a checking acc.with lets say $4600 for total of $4700.This type of Acc. "Everyday Checking", comes with a $10 Monthly Service Fee, which one of the ways that could be waved is to maintain a minimum of $1500.Now as part of this checking/savings acc. is a scam called "Save As You Go". That means that every time you make some electronic transaction (like paying a bill), usually $1, $2, $3 or more dollars, (depending on the amount of the transaction), will be transferred from your checking part of the acc. to the Saving acc.The idea is that YOU are to stupid to manage and save your own money, so Wells Fargo will do it for you by moving a dollar or two of your own money from your checking to your savings.As a result of this scam, you can find yourself in a position where you have, lets say, $400 in your Savings acc., and $1600 in your checking, for a total of $2000.So, lets assume You make a "bill pay" to your Cable Co. of $100, that leaves a balance in your checking acc. of $1500, and your So called "Save As You Go"savings acc., still has the $400 for a total of $1900.Here is the kicker, remember, You checking had $1600, you paid the cable co. $100, you have left $1500, but because Well Fargo moved $1 dollar to your savings, your Savings amount became $401, and your checking $1499.At $1499 in your checking, you are below the $1500 and therefore you are subject to a $10 Monthly Service Fee, even though you still have $401 in your savings.now, I am sure that those very young, smart, highly educated people in the wells fargo boardroom, get a lot of money paid to find ways that will boost the Bank's profits, but ultimately, a "Pig with a Lipstick, is still a pig".It should be obvious by now that my issue is not the $10.I could close my acc. and make sure that these will be the first, the last and the only $10 wells Fargo will ever take from me (very inexpensive insurance policy against wells Fargo ever taking another penny out of me). I still think is a scam, is designed to exploit the poor and I will forward my thoughts and your response to the local news (starting with Michael Turko of the Turko Files Ch. 9 - KUSI News - San Diego, CA), and follow with Huffington Post and let the public decide with their comments whether my point is valid or not.… read more

You've totaly misread the 3 ways to avoid the $10.00 fee. First off, if you DO the savings, that alone automatically waives the $10.00 checking fee. 2nd is if you use your debit card 10x, and Wells Fargo is very upfront, in fact, around 1pm, they post pending transactions that come in that night! So, at 2pm your balance could be -$90.00 and you can cover it before they post that night! NO other bank lets you know what's coming through, as that's money directly out of their pocket! 3rd is to simply have a measly $500.00 in direct deposits for the month, and this includes direct deposits from square and cash.me/scotttampa . Also, they are up front about these too! You have 24-7 access next to each option, it shows how many debit card purchases you have ( I just run 10 $1.00 charges through square) and also shows your total direct deposits, and one month I came up short and guess what! They didn't charge the $10.00... they said "as a valued customer we've noticed you came close this month so we'll waive the $10.00 but please keep an eye on your numbers and make sure one of the options is completed each month.So, You are WAY off base. Also, I created this account on their website in 5 minutes with only a $25.00 initial deposit! Received a debit card and signature card to sign and mail back within 4 days. BEST BANK I'VE EVER BANKED WITH, as they don't HIDE THINGS.Scott McClellanTampa, Florida… read more

my husband has Wells Fargo. So far they have let someone walk in cash a check for $250 claiming to be my husband, No ID. only the check and ATM card from a savings account They continually let google play charges to go through. They ate being sued because employees used custiomer ijnfo to open lines of credit and use it. There is another class action suit but can't remember what that was. He gets put through more security using his account then joe blow off thes street. We had to shop after christmas last year we had all the kids stuff in the cart and had to put it back.

Credit Union of the Rockies used to be a good institution, but it seems they have lost all customer service. I had been with them for 15+years. We had financed a car and our home and had a standing line of credit. We maintained a healthy balance in our accounts and were never late on a payment (actually we always paid our loans off early. Anyway, we were buying a condo as an investment and needed a mortgage for about 25% of the property (we were bringing a 75% down-payment to the table). Credit Unions of the Rockies uses a mortgage broker, we applied and the service we received was appalling: Keith Schnell, theLoan Officer with CU Members Mortgage was very slow to communicate and even though we applied 6 weeks prior to the closing, he was still messing around two days before closing. We ended up taking a short term loan from another source and closing without the loan from the Credit Union of the Rockies. The poor performance of Mr. Schnell and CUR costs us time, an $400 appraisal and put our $5,000 earnest money at risk. I have had almost no follow up from the CUR even though I left messages and send a letter when closing our accounts. I can not recommend Credit Union of the Rockies or Credit Union Members Mortgage.… read more

I have just moved my business to Hampshire First Bank and so far I am very pleased with the service. The fees are very small for checking and savings and they encourage paper-less internet banking which I find to be the most convenient way to bank. This is a recommended bank.

I recently discontinued my account with this bank for several reasons. I was with TD Bank since them being Commerce Bank. I truly enjoyed the fact that they were open 7 days a week and had longer working hours then other banks. The customer service was excellent and I had no issues with them. A bout 2 years after them becoming TD Bank I started to notice several fees being charged to my account. And even more overdraft fees when I specifically called them and took that option off of my account so that I would never overdraft it. The customer service was horrible. This became such a problem that I ended up having hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees. I am planing on taking this matter to court because of the fact that they are liars and I feel that they do that just to take money from you.… read more

Ally use to be good. But sadly this is no longer the case. They have raised fees. Put $10 cap on ATM fee reimbursement. They also are scandalous in there system. Debits are applied before credits which means if you have low balance and have a bill on auto pay and you put money in your account the same day, the bill is paid first and you are charged an overdraft fee which is now $25 a hit. You get 1 overdraft fee reimbursement for the Lifetime of the account. Not monthly or annually LIFETIME OF THE ACCOUNT. worst of all is there TERRIBLE Customer service which btw is only 24/7 phone or email now. All the things that made Ally great are now gone. Best to look else where for your online banking needs.… read more

I have been using the Washington Federal bank for maybe three years now,and it seems to me that they are one of those banks that wants to keep your money if you put it in their bank. There was an instance when I was trying to withdraw my money and got to the bank 10 minutes early before they would stop letting people withdraw their money or transfer it. Because of the long lines, I ended up having to wait 12 minutes, and so I was 2 minutes late. The women inside refused to give me money, and i did not have any money for the weekend. I called her supervisor and it was resolved, but it should not have happened in the first place. it was horrible ,and I am not too fond of them anymore. Watch out with this bank, they will try to keep YOUR money.… read more

I have a fixed mortgage of 5.5% with Weber state Credit Union. Back in June, I applied for re-financing with the same lender. I was approved for a rate of 3.25%. Closing was supposed to take place at end of August, but it did not because the bank made an error on some house paperwork that is invalid. They now have to go through the process of removing the error, but I have to continue to pay a higher interest on my mortgage - not to any fault of my own. Robbery in plain daylight! i feel like this at least.… read more

I immediately switched over to Bashas Associates Federal Credit Union after being with Bank of America for five years. I wanted to be with a bank that hand superb customer service and treated customers fairly. I have overall been happy with the services I have received and the 24/7 support I have gotten abroad and domestically. There have been several situations in which my bank account had been compromised and needed assistance with Bashas. Although they weren't as quick to respond as BofA would be, they still worked hard to send me new cards and secure my account without too much of a hassle. I enjoy how helpful the tellers are and how they seem to actually care about your bank security in a more personalized manner compared to big corporate banks.… read more

My Bank is Capitol One. It is a great bank and I've been with them for over 5 years. I have had a savings and checking account. They offer certain benefits to the checking account that I truly appreciate such as no International withdrawal fees. The customer service is excellent whenever I've had to call for various reasons. The saving account interest rate is not great like all the other banks but when I initially sign up they had the highest rate I keep hoping it will go back up. I sincerely would recommend the previous ‘ING’ and now Capitol One to anyone needing a good reliable internet bank.… read more

I've been with Wells Fargo for over 5 years. What a pleasant and easy 5 years it has been. I know almost every bank teller and employee that works at my local Wells Fargo on a first name basis. They are extremely nice and really try to understand what you want done. I've been to banks where some of the bank tellers just don't want to deal with your problem and what you gone. But, Wells Fargo is nothing like that. The services they offer are great. I took out a loan and it was very easy with no hassle. No random fees.

I have been a Wells Fargo customer for over 15 years. Whenever I call or visit Wells Fargo, the customer service is usually very good. The agent is very respectful and appreciative and handles queries as best as s/he can. Recently, I accidentally left my card in the ATM machine at my local branch. When I called the bank about it, they informed me that the ATM will automatically shred the card if I do not take it out of the machine. They went ahead and arranged for a new one to be sent to my address. In the meantime, they told me to visit a local branch, and an agent could issue me a temporary card connected to my account. I visited a branch later that day, and was issued a card within five minutes. I was quite impressed with the efficiency and speed. I had been so annoyed with myself, thinking about how inconvenient my "card-less" existence would be for the next week. In the end, Wells Fargo made this inconvenience as hassle-free as possible, which I did really appreciate.… read more

I have been a member with Cedar Point Federal Credit Union in southern MD for about 20 years. I have never had a bad experience with them. Their staff is friendly and welcoming, they go out of their way to help and give information or answer any questions that you have, and are extremely helpful with any problems that I have had arise. I have my main checking and savings account with them, as well as used them for two different car loans. The loan process was very new and overwhelming to me, but the associate at Cedar Point answered all questions, recommended the best type of loan for me, and set up the loan and payment plan with ease.The employees are very knowledgeable, eager to help, and make you feel welcomed at "at home." They remember names of their clients, and you are always welcomed (usually by name) as soon as you enter.

I have had no problems with TD bank at all so far. I have been using them for 4 years, since I was a freshman at my college. I chose them because they were close to my home and they had a student specialty program so I wouldn't need a specific amount of dollars in my bank account. A td bank atm was even in my college as well, providing extra convenience. I love that they allow you to take their pens. The feel and atmosphere of the bank was nice. They always allow you to get free items such as candy or hand sanitizers. Every experience with them has gone smoothly. I have a checkings account and I haven't really used credit or purchases on anything big. They have a banking app that is useful and reliable as well.… read more

I have been a member of Patriot Federal Credit Union for 4years now, and have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with them. They offer all the convenience of the big banks but at a fraction of the cost. I initially started with them because of the favorable loan options a credit union can provide, and have never been let down. The interest I pay for loans is much lower then any traditional lending institution I've shopped with. If you live in an area that Patriot Federal Credit Union serves, I would highly recommend establishing a relationship with them. You won't be disappointed and will look at the big banks differently.… read more

I can’t say enough great things about having USAA as a bank. Their overall fees are very low, and they reimburse you for a certain amount of ATM withdrawl fees each month. Additionally, their online banking app is extremely easy to use, and you can easily deposit checks through your mobile phone. Customer service is stellar too.

I thought that I would have to co-sign for him,but that was not to be. I have 4 accounts with MFCU,a savings,a Christmas club account,and two checking accounts.

Bank of America has been my bank for many years. Once there was an incident where my account had been comprised ( by someone nameless ). I went into the bank to resolve it. Honestly I was surprised and relieved at how this was handled. One account had to be closed, a new one opened; easy and painless. So many pleasing attributes in my opinion, not to mention ease of use, banking online, bill pay, chat, and the list goes on. The thing I enjoy most about my bank is I'm able to transfer funds easily to family members and vise versa. Oh did I mention some overdraft fees have been refunded as a courtesy. I can go on and go.

I recently opened checking and savings accounts with USAA. I am extremely pleased with them so far. I had been very happy with the same national bank for close to 20 years, but when a couple of problems arose with them, things went south for me very quickly. I chose USAA because I use the company for my auto and homeowner's insurance,All the services (insurance, banking services, etc.) USAA offered are centered around veterans and our specific needs. I've had nothing but positive experiences with their insurance services, and I can honestly also say the same about my experiences to date with their checking and savings products. I pay no monthly fees; the accounts have no minimum balance, and they extend the same excellent service in their banking division as they do for their insurance policies.The only downside is that you either have to be a veteran or related to one to join. If you are eligible, however, I strongly encourage you to join.… read more

And every time,EVERY time,that I questioned something,they always had an answer for me. The customer service is excellent!! The auto rate loans (I have had 4) are also one of the lowest that you will find out here in san diego. I am a father of 6 and all my kids are with NFCU also.

A few years ago I totaled my car just a week after paying it off. I was very upset; especially since it was the other person's fault. They ran a stop sign and hit me right on the driver's side door. The car spun several times and I found myself trapped inside. After the accident I could see the other driver and his friends moving his car to make it look like it was my fault. They then tried to move my car with me inside, instead of trying to help me get out. The entire experience was dreadful and the other driver's insurance company refused to pay because of the way the cars had been set up. USAA, however, believed me when I told them what happened. They got me a rental car that very day and I had money to buy a new car with a couple of days. I also got more than I was expecting. Banking, insurance, and savings with USAA is always a good experience!… read more

I am always embarrassed to make the call, once again that I have misplaced my card. They help me as if it was my first time each and every time.

My bank Is US Bank. A bit like heirlooms, US Bank has been passed down and always used by my family. Recently, i opened a checking account upon my 18th birthday. When signing up at my branch they put a student indicator on my account saying the $8.95 maintenance fee would be waived. For one reason or another it was for about two months then this month it wasn't refunded. I called customer service and they switched me over to a "Easy Student" account which did cost $2 but is waived by online statements. If you ever have an Issue their customer service is top notch and they try hard to help you. Bonus for some: customer service is based in the US so it's all native speakers from here. That personally doesn't matter to me but for older people or folks with trouble understanding international people it would help. The US Bank android app is wonderful and simple. Really my only qualm with US Bank is that their money sending system online is hard and bad from the app. All together, It would be hard to find a better bank then good ol' US Bank.… read more

I can transfer money, pay bills, make deposits all from my phone or computer even while I'm on the go. I don't have time to go the physical bank. The representatives are always helpful as well. In addition, they offer many discounts on products and services within and out of the bank. I am certain I will never bank with another institution as they are a one-stop shop.… read more

I bank with First Convenience Bank in Central Texas. They are located in all the local Walmarts which is very nice. Recently, I had a very low balance in my account and accidently used my debit card, over drawing my account since the bank does not decline point of sale purchases to costumers in good standing. This caused several over draft charges that amounted to about $100.00 dollars. I went in to my local branch and explained the situation, the woman I was speaking with removed the charges and resolved the issue on the spot. I was very pleased.… read more

US Bank based in Minnesota,is our bank of choice offering reasonably good customer service as well as good credit products and loan services.Many contacts with customer service on the phone have ended with me well satisfied that my problems or questions were well taken care of.My only negative comments would be in the area of their charges for overdraft coverage,which doesnt really affect me that much, as well as the lack of offices reasonably close to my home.I would grade them out at a B+.… read more

I recently opened a checking account with Citibank. Citibank has a number of locations all over New York City, and I’d heard good things from a friend so I decided this was the way to go. I liked that there is no interest rate, and monthly fees are low. I’ve had good experience with customer service so far as well. I would recommend using this bank if you are near a branch and wanting to go with a reputable large scale operation.… read more

I have used Farmers & Merchants Bank in the past when I lived in a different city and I was overall pleased. I had both a checking and savings account with them, and I found their APR rates and policies and terms to be overall fair. I also found their customer service representatives to be very helpful and efficient.

Yes, you can get a loan with tarnished credit, but you will have to pay a considerably higher interest rate because lenders assume you are a higher risk. You should attempt to rebuild the relationships you have with existing creditors to help improve your credit in the short term. If your accounts have not gone past 90 days in delinquency there is a good chance that by calling and speaking to a customer service rep, or by sending along a 'goodwill' letter and simultaneously making your accounts current your lenders may report your accounts as never late. There are a lot of other ways to remove past negative remarks from your credit report, but it is important that your first become current with all over due accounts. You should begin by puling your free annual credit report from https://www.annualcreditreport.com/ so you can begin to triage the worst of your accounts. Once you have a better picture of where you credit is now, you can begin the process of forming a recovery strategy and determine which lenders may be willing to extend credit to you. I would recommend staying away from credit counseling agencies and others such as Lexington Law because they are incredibly expensive and you can everything and more than they are able to do with a little research of your own. You may wish to familiarize yourself with 'credit good will letters' and have a look at the following websites:www.creditboards.comwww.myFico.comGood luck, you will certainly be able to repair your credit in good time!… read more

Once I've called them and provided some clarification details, the person on the phone was able to open the account for me.

I agree with Jess below that Woodforest National Bank is a reliable and great option when it comes to banks because they are located in Walmart stores. Pretty much everywhere you go there is a Walmart so you can get the banking assistance that you need.

I would recommend this bank for anyone who is looking for a convenient bank.… read more

Woodforest National Bank is perhaps the most useful bank in the country because most of them are located in Walmart stores. This bank has saved me a lot of hassle because I have moved about four times in eight years, and there has been a Woodforest branch in all four of these locations. I don't find their checking account itself to be substantially better than any other checking available at a national bank, but their customer service is ideal, with rapidly moving lines and friendly demeanor in all transactions I've had.… read more

Up to date I have had no complaints or bad experiences. If you want a good bank with the local home grown feeling, Wells is your home.… read more

If you have a question about anything you can call direct to your branch or email them and you get a personal answer to any question you may have.

I have been with Credit Union One for about three years and I can honestly say I have never had any problems with them. The one thing I wish that they had was more places I can use an ATM machine that I don't have to pay a fee to use. I like the security that they also offer, I am notified immediately if they question any kind of questionable use on my account, I get emails from them notifying me even if my account is logged into too many times in one day. I am planning on getting a car loan from them in the next month or so, I'm sure they will be a pretty easy process since I already belong with them.… read more

My checking account is with UBS Bank USA. I like it the way they handle their clients. Each time my maintaining balance drops, they don't charge me right away with the penalty. They call me first, notifying that if I can't replenish the account balance they would be constrained to impose the penalty. And they are so endearing when they do this during the course of the conversation. I call it human touch. That to me is very polite and courteous disposition of a Bank.… read more

Whenever I call them, they are always friendly and helpful. There have been times that I made mistakes in my checking, causing the dreaded $29.00 overdraft fee, but a simple phone call with explanation has always been enough to get the charges reversed, which means I don't often have to worry about extra money leaving my account for fees and such.… read more

I have an account with TDBank North. I am very unhappy with them My account was somehow compromised and money was taken and used without my knowledge. They said it was used with an ATM card but I have the card. I have the card though so the bank is telling me they will not refund the money taken without doing a complete investigation. I understand they need to investigate but I have been a customer for maybe 10 years without any previous issues. They should return the disputed funds until/unless they can find no evidence of a theft. Even then if that happens that would be bad for me because the money really was taken. I would recommend another bank.… read more

We have banked with Vystar and its predecessor Jax Navy Fed C/U for nearly thirty years and have never had any problems with them except one recent event where an apparent unauthorized charge on our debit card appeared from a vendor we hadn't used in six months. Also, on the date of the charge we were not in town, making the charge appear fraudulent. Vystar reversed the charge and began an investigation. After three months and a thoroughly helpful Vystar customer service rep we discovered the charge to be correct. The vendor had taken its time to submit the proper paper work. Must be nice to be in no hurry to get paid.… read more

I bank with Chase Manhattan, just Chase to most and I have to say that every time I go in they are nice, the wait is never very long and the place is always clean. One time I needed $150 in gold dollars for a fundraiser and I went in and they said that most branches usually only have about $50 unless you order them in advance. Well, I didn't have that kind of time. I didn't think I would have to order them. So I told the gal I would just drive to a few banks. She told me to wait while she made a couple calls. When she came back about 5minutes later she said she called the bank next door (an independent credit union) and that they had what I needed and someone would bring them right over! Within 10 minutes I was out the door and didn't have to drive all over town! They always go the extra mile when I need them to. Plus hardly any fees and a good interest rate...all the boring things..haha..makes this a great bank I will stay with for years and years!… read more

My deciding factor in choosing Green Dot was how user friendly and easy the card is to use.  I've had a wonderful experience with it since I can use it anywhere as a credit or debit card and refill's are easy. My experience with Direct Deposit and Transfers are easy and wonderful to use. It does cost monthly, but the ease and flexibility are worth it!

I have been banking with one local credit union in San Antonio - Generations FCU - since 2003. It has expanded and acquired more branches since the time I opened my accounts with them. I definitely like their interest rates on loans and very straight-forward membership fees and policies. Overdraft and other account fees are way cheaper than in major banks. My account is free, because I have a direct deposit. The new location is very close to my house. I was able to get several car loans through them at a very low rate and still have a line of credit.… read more

Re: Wells Fargo, when I used their ATM for the first time I was charged a fee that I never agreed to. They referred to it as a "inquirer fee." This was in addition to a $3 fee that I did agreed to. This put my account into the negative. I discussed this with the bank and showed them my receipt which did state that I did not agree to the charge. After a call with the bank manager it was agreed that this was an unintentional mix-up an overdraft was not charged. At least they made it right.… read more

We changed from a different back to WPCU about ten years ago and have had no issues with their banking or service. We have done multiple home refinances and auto loans as the fee structures and rates tend to be the best. The staff is knowledgeable and made every effort to advise us of changing and best rates. One of the better benefits is not being constantly hit with numerous fees for the privilege of banking with them. The only negative that I have is the lack of locations to do ATM transactions. On the flip side, if I have to use a out of network ATM, WPCU allows me to recover the cost of the transaction. So, they do almost everything right to earn and keep my business.… read more

Allegacy Federal Credit Union is a southeastern credit union that provides outstanding service. The company is extremely conservative with credit lending decisions.

I have been a customer for over two decades and have not had a problem. Their standards are high and they take few risks, especially when it comes to borrowing. I can't say that I have always been happy with their decisions, but in retrospect, I believe the correct decision was made.… read more

I have had an Capital One 360 account for about 6 months and I can honestly say I have never been so pleased with a bank before. For those of you who don't know, CO 360 is an online-based banking experience. I moved to the middle of nowhere, Tennessee where there are mostly Credit Unions and very few big banks, so I decided to open a CO 360 account. You can deposit checks just by taking a picture of them with your phone; you can do Person2Person transfers and if the receiver also has Capital One the transfer is instant (Example: I told my roommate to get us Taco Bell on the way home and transferred $15 to her, which she received immediately). They also give you the option of opening as many savings accounts as you'd like, and even have an automatic-savings plan where you choose how much to put in each savings account every month. Whenever I call the bank for any questions or assistance, a customer service representative answers IMMEDIATELY. No confusing and misleading menus! I recommend it to everyone. Did I mention there's no annual fees or minimums?… read more

When I lived in New York I was drawn to TD Bank for their flexible hours (closed at 7pm, open on Sundays). That worked great for a while until my student privileges expired. They would charge me $5 if I didn't have a minimum of $50 in the account. There were also no TD Banks or ATMs in the Brooklyn area, and they would charge you $2 if you withdrew money at a non-TD Bank ATM. In the end I realized this bank was established for rich, Wall Street people and closed my account.… read more

I have a Bank Account with Fifth Third Bank. I absolutely love this bank. The only downfall was the opening deposit amount of $50 because I was just getting back on my feet. At the time I opened my account with them, I had terrible credit due to a separation that I had recently went through. I was trying to get my life back in order and I was denied an account by almost every bank. Fifth Third Bank offered me a second chance with their second chance checking. I opened my second chance checking account and began to use it wisely. After six months of continuous responsible checking with Fifth Third Bank they helped me get approved for a small personal loan to help rebuild my credit. They also offer an identity Theft program that is a great tool to alert you when something looks suspicious. I love Fifth Third Bank!… read more

I tried to call customer service and was on hold for at least 30-45 minutes and then finally got threw the person on the other end was extremely rude and said they were transferring me to another department. The customer service person failed to mention before transferring me that that department was not even open. Very frustrating and I didn't want to have to wait another 45 minutes on hold again. So anyone who don't like to wait and anyone who don't make $100,000 or more a year should not bank with Huntington.… read more

I was a day late. I spoke with the manager about waving the NSF fee since it was my first time and I was a valued customer. She politely said no. Therefore, I not only had that check bounce, but another check bounced as well. I had to pay two NSF fees and was unable to cover my bills because of it.

The main issue with the bank is the hidden charges which they never tell you about while you are opening an account with them.For transactions that you do overseas they are going to charge $5 as processing fees which other reputed banks are not.Also if for 3 months you don't deposit any money they are going to charge you for that.In my opinion this information should be given to customers prior to opening the account.… read more

I switched to Huntington bank this year because it does not hassle me with service fees, and it is close to the university I will be attending. I love how Huntington is open every day of the week. It is convenient for people who work during the week and can only make it to the bank on the weekend. Overall I am satisfied with this service. My biggest issue is that checks take several days to clear and the bankers can be a bit pushy when they are trying to sell the bank's credit card. For instance, when I walked into the bank the first time after opening an account, the banker I worked with skipped hellos and immediately asked if I was still considering the credit card even though I told him no last time. Usually the staff is friendly and takes care of my needs quickly when I visit, however.… read more

I currently have 5/3 Bank for my checking and savings account, as well as, for a mortgage loan. We chose this bank primarily because of location (right across the street from our previous address). We have never had any issues with them and I have always found their customer service to be excellent (kind, considerate, respectful, pleasant and attentive to my needs). Setting up the mortgage with them and our accounts was easy breezy. The only issue we have with them now is that they are not nearby so we have to travel some ways to get to them now that we relocated. It would be nice if they upgraded to things such as taking a pic of a check and utilizing those tools like Chase does. Outside of that, I do recommend this bank to anyone who is searching for a new bank.… read more

I applied for a home mortgage at Mountain West Bank in Idaho. It turned into a miserable experience. The first mortgage broker took all my information and started to shop for rates. Two anxious weeks later he told me that no one wanted my mortgage. I have great credit and 50% down payment but because it was a rural home with minimal fire protection (the home is on forest service land) no one wanted the loan. I talked to a second loan officer at Mountain West who said that he had other contacts to check. Another long week of waiting and no response. When I started to call these loan officers back they didn't want to take my calls. Very disappointing. I would not recommend doing business with them in the future.… read more

I recently opened up an account with Woodforest National Bank. I have had this account for less than a year, but I can already tell that this bank stands out among the others because it truly cares about its banking customers. Checks deposited to your account are available immediately. Even checks deposited through ATM are available the same day - within the hour. There is no ridiculous holding process for larger checks or deposited funds. The tellers are always friendly and happy to help. The only complaint that I have would be the number of locations in the Houston area, inner loop. One important aspect of your bank is number of locations. Direct deposit works for me now, but any time I need to be physically present for any banking, I do have to hunt down a location.… read more

Citibank. During my younger corporate years, I was delinquent with my credit card payments at one point. Couple of years after, I was unexpectedly approved for a Citibank Visa credit card. I must say that their application assessment is thorough and they give considerations or chances for young professionals to reestablish their credit.

They provide answers to all our questions and will have a very friendly relation with the customers.

Around one year ago I opened an account at a local Busey Bank, in my home city. It´s not a very well-known bank, but it´s close to my home and, so far, I´ve had no problem with it. The bank features a no minimum balance requirement, with the sole condition of getting the statements on-line. It offers debit and credit cards, online banking, mobile and direct deposit, and its customer service is excellent. The only detail I´m a little bit disappointed with is the fact that every time I sign-in online I have to wait for an E-mail with an access code, but that problem is a minor one. The problem lies on the fact that, I don´t know why, the system is unable to recognize my computer. It´s somehow a bargain, but nothing compared to the possibilities it features.… read more

MidFirst Bank has been the best bank I've ever used. The fact that they allow you to use any ATM and not charge you a fee is the most solid choice for going with them. They always make you feel welcome every time you visit their locations. The only negative experience I have had with them is putting a hold on my account for a purchase I made for $2. I appreciate the fact that a bank will look out for you but it caused a problem when I didn't know and I was trying to make a purchase. I guess I would've appreciated a phone call or an email telling me that they put a hold on the account...and did a $2 purchase for something unusual really warrant a hold? Other than that, great bank and I will be a member for years to come!… read more

This bank only gave me about 5 mobile transfer actions per month which was far less than what I would prefer because I like to make transfers from my savings to checking account to make sure I had enough funds for what I wanted to buy. I also use my mobile banking system a lot so it was a serious problem I had with this bank.… read more

Will Proposed Interchange Legislation Actually Help the Prepaid Debit Card Industry?
The regulation of debit card interchange fees in the U.S. took a step closer to reality this week with the Senate’s passage of Senator Durbin’s “Interchange Fee Amendment” as part of the “Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010”.  Regulation of interchange is a hotly contested topic, and the amendment is sure to meet with opposition in the House from the financial services industry in general and Visa (NYSE: V) and MasterCard (NYSE: MA).  But does the Interchange Fee Amendment actually help the prepaid debit card industry?

Comments are in on the Federal Reserve Gift Card Rules
In November, the Federal Reserve published their proposed rules for prepaid cards.  The Federal Reserve set a shortened comment period, which ended yesterday.  We’ve reviewed all of the publicly available comments and, with the exception of several comments (which we’ll discuss separately), our reaction is …. huh?

Why does Bancorp take all of the money paid to them for a prepaid debit card if not used by a certain date? That is not your money.

I purchased a Vision Premier Prepaid Visa Card, which I understand is issued by Bancorp, sometime in 2007. At the time I created a User’s ID and a password. Over the years I did not need it, but since Geico quit accepting cash for my auto insurance, I suddenly needed the card again. I loaded it with cash at Western Union and tried to pay my Geico bill, but the card had expired years ago. After many hours of trying to find a person to talk to, I gave up and went back to Western Union. Western Union got me connected to a person to file for a “lost card”. I told her that I still had my card, but it expired and I just needed it renewed. Well it took about a week of waiting, and I received the card. It still had the same number with a new expiration date. Then I tried to get online to activate the card, but cannot remember the User ID and Password I used in 2007. There is no place on the card, or the web site to get a real person to talk to and get it straightened out. I can somehow get them to send me a change password code. But it does not accept the User Name when I return, and I cannot open a new account because it says they cannot find the number. They don’t offer me any test questions to help me remember my User’s ID like other sites do when I forget. How can I find a real person to help me get this straightened out? Is there any person that could reply to my post to tell me how to find someone to help me. I am a senior with some memory problems. I could not remember my password for my computer today, but after I thought about it for a while I could remember it. But trying to remember the User ID and Password from 2007 is not as easy. I have searched through every email since 2006 and cannot find where my User ID or my password shows up. I should have it somewhere but I can’t find where I would have put it. Please help.

This card is some bull-shit… The bank put a hold on my account and can not explain to me in detail WHY??? My funds are direct deposit for years and now I suddenly can not access my funds. I had dinner with my 3 small kids and checked my funds in the AM before dinner at 7PM. I was retained by officers due to the non ability to pay for our meal of $88.09… My funds was well over $600.00.. I was in custody and my husband could not or didn’t receive the text message until it was too late. Now, I was afraid, my kids scared and taken away all for some fuck up situation this card created.

Bancorp are thieves and their exact prepaid mastercard is bullshit. They have 40.70 of my money and will not return it to my account. They screw up on an order I made with a company, they doubled the amount, I contact the seller myself, he cancels the doubled item. Exact will not contact me or put MY money back into account. They are chiseling thieves who all belong in jail along with their overseas telephone staff!!!!

I was awarded a gift card from your bank via a tire company I had done business with in my town. I just realized that it is good thru 1/17. But when I went to purchase an item online and put down the 1/17 as there was no place to enter Good thru 1/17, so my order was refused! But, I could still buy it with a different card. I want to use this one as it will expire soon! The amount the card was $12. Could you send me another card with that amount on it?! I would appreciate that if you could! 
Thanks,
Anita Spencer
