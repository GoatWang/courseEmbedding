Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Corporation FAQs - Frequently Asked Legal Questions About Corporations | LegalZoom























Skip to main content







In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Knowledge Center&rtrif;Corporation&rtrif;FAQ 









Corporation FAQ
Find FAQs related to forming a corporation.
















What are the main differences between a C corporation and an S corporation?


C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, one tax at the corporate level on the corporation's net income, and another tax to the shareholders when the profits are distributed. S corporations have only one level of taxation. All of their income is allocated to the shareholders.
However, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility and can shield shareholders from direct tax liability. In addition, S corporations are subject to limitations, such as the number and type of shareholders they can have.
LegalZoom will help you start a C corporation or an S corporation. Get started by answering a few questions about your company, and we will file your paperwork with the Secretary of State.



 





How do I choose a corporate name?


In general, the name of a corporation must end with "incorporated,"
            "corporation" or an abbreviation of one of these. A name will not be accepted
            if it is likely to mislead the public or if it too closely resembles the name
            of another corporation already formed in that state. Many states also
            restrict the use of certain terms in a corporation's name (like bank, police
            or insurance).
LegalZoom allows you to choose up to three alternative names, in order of
            preference. We will conduct a name check before filing to see which names are
            available. Please note that for government purposes the names "ABC, Inc." and
            "A.B.C., Corp." are identical. Therefore, you should disregard spaces, periods
            and the corporate ending when coming up with your three name
            choices.
If the name of your corporation will be used in connection with
            goods or services, you may wish to consider obtaining federal trademark
            protection for the name. This helps ensure that no one else in the U.S. may use
            that name in connection with the same general type of goods or services
            (except in areas where someone else is already using that
            name).



 





Is a corporation required to have a registered agent?


Each corporation must have a registered agent  (some states use the term "resident agent" 
            or "statutory agent," but the concept is the same). This is the person
            designated to receive official state correspondence and notice if the
            corporation is served with a lawsuit. Most states require that the registered agent must be
            either:

(1) an adult living in the state of formation with a street
              address (P.O. boxes are not acceptable) or
(2) a corporation or limited liability company with a business office in the state of formation
              that provides registered agent services.

One of the advantages of forming a corporation or limited liability company in your home state is
            that any officer or director (of a corporation) or manager or member (of an LLC) can act as the registered agent. However, there
            are some advantages to having another person or company act as your
            registered agent. First, this adds an extra layer of privacy, since the
            registered agent's name and address are publicly available. Second, this
            helps limit the risk that if your corporation or LLC is named as a defendant in a lawsuit, no one will surprise
            you at home on a Sunday night with court papers.



 





How much will it cost to form and run a corporation?


Each state charges an annual fee to maintain a corporation. In many
            states, you must also submit an "annual report" or "list of directors and
            officers," which is a one-page form sent by the state. Some states also have
            state taxes.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Delaware?


The advantages of incorporating in Delaware according to the Delaware Secretary of State: 
More than half a million business entities have their legal home in Delaware. This includes more than half of all U.S. publicly-traded and Fortune 500 companies. Businesses choose Delaware for its complete incorporation services package, which includes modern and flexible corporate laws, the highly-respected Delaware Courts, a business-friendly state government and the customer service oriented staff of the Delaware Division of Corporations. 



 





What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?


An LLC has more operating flexibility and fewer
            corporate formalities than an S corporation. For example, an S corporation
            cannot have more than 100 stockholders and must hold both periodic director's
            meetings and an annual meeting of stockholders. However, owners of an S
            corporation may be subject to fewer taxes than LLC owners.
            For more information, please see "Differences
            Between a Corporation and a Limited Liability Company (LLC)" from the main
            guide.


 





Do I need an attorney to form a corporation?


No, you do not need an attorney to form a corporation. You can
            prepare the legal paperwork and file it yourself, or use a legal
            documentation service such as LegalZoom.
To learn more and speak with a representative, please call us at
            (888) 381-8758.



 





What is the procedure for forming a corporation, and what legal documents are required?


To create a corporation, you must file a document called the "articles of incorporation" 
            with the Secretary of State or other appropriate state agency. Next,
            bylaws and organizing resolutions must be adopted. A corporation will also
            need to apply for a tax identification number with the IRS.
Unlike many other incorporation services which only
            create and file the articles of incorporation, LegalZoom can 
            complete all of these required documents for you, including personalized bylaws
            and organizational resolutions.



 





What are the advantages of incorporating in Nevada?


According to the Nevada Secretary of State, the following details the advantages of incorporating in Nevada: 

No corporate income tax 

No taxes on corporate shares 
No franchise tax 
No personal income tax 
No I.R.S. information sharing agreement 
Nominal annual fees 
Minimal reporting and disclosure requirements 
Stockholders are not on public record 



 





What are the naming conventions for professional corporations?


Have you ever noticed the initials "P.C." or "P.A." after a company's
            name? These initials indicate the company is a professional corporation ("P.C.") 
            or a professional association ("P.A."). State law dictates what is required in the 
            name, and those requirements differ by state.



 





What is a professional corporation?


Professional corporations (PC) are corporations that provide
            professional services. State law and the regulating board determine what
            constitutes professional services and when you are required to be a
            professional corporation. This varies from state to
            state.



 





Can I be the only shareholder in my corporation?


Yes, a corporation can be formed with only one shareholder.
            However, corporate formalities, such as director and shareholder meetings,
            are still required in order to preserve the corporate form and prevent the
            shareholder from personal liability.



 





What is a corporation?



            A corporation is a distinct legal entity created under state laws which can
            open a bank account, purchase property, enter into contracts and operate a
            business. One of the most important features of a corporation is that,
            generally, its owners are not personally liable for the debts of the
            corporation.


 





When is a corporation considered a professional corporation?


The definition of "professionals" can vary from state to state, but typically includes professions that require a license, such as doctors, chiropractors, lawyers, dentists, accountants, architects or engineers. Depending on the state where you incorporate, the following activities may be classified as professional services. 
Accounting and financial services 
Architectural services
Legal services
Medical services



 





Where should I incorporate?


A corporation can incorporate in any of the 50 states, plus the
            District of Columbia. Many people choose to incorporate in their home
            state, which can save money in filing fees. That is because corporations are
            required to register in each state where they do business. For example, a
            Delaware corporation that has its main business office in Arkansas must
            register as a "foreign corporation" with the Arkansas Secretary of
            State and must pay applicable fees and taxes to both Delaware and Arkansas. Delaware is popular
            because of its history, experience and pro-business climate. Nevada is also
            popular because of its pro-business environment and lack of a formal
            information-sharing agreement with the IRS. Please read the next two FAQs for
            more specifics on each state.



 





Who can form a corporation?


Generally, anyone who completes the articles of incorporation and pays the
            state filing fee can form a corporation. There are usually no residency or
            other legal requirements. However, many states require that an individual forming 
            a corporation must be at least 18 years old.

WATERLOO, Ontario, July 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Open Text Corporation (NASDAQ:OTEX) (TSX:OTEX) announced today that it believes its proposal to acquire 100% of the common stock of Covisint Corporation (NASDAQ: COVS) for $2.45 per share in cash provides Covisint shareholders with compelling overall value and value certainty.  OpenText noted that the agreed-upon consideration, which was the result of an active and aggressive negotiation, reflects significant value to shareholders, as represented by the offer price's approximate premium of (i) 23% to the closing price per share of Covisint's common stock on June 2, 2017, (ii) 27% to the volume-weighted average trading price per share of Covisint's common stock for the 30-day period ending on June 2, 2017, and (iii) 46% to the cash-adjusted price per share of Covisint's common stock for the 30-day period ending on June 2, 2017.((1))
Given the lengthy exploration of strategic alternatives that Covisint undertook (as described in Covisint's proxy materials) and the attractive premium and valuation reflected in OpenText's offer, OpenText believes a rejection of the offer exposes Covisint shareholders to significant market valuation risk and diminished liquidity.  OpenText remains fully committed to closing a Covisint transaction, which is in the best interests of both companies' shareholders, but does not intend to increase the consideration offered to Covisint shareholders.

            Company Profile
          
                NATURE OF BUSINESS: Open Text Corporation develops and sells high performance text retrieval software products. Open Text 5 software is considered to be the market leader in high performance text retrieval technology. Latitude, the award-winning electronic document delivery system, was announced in April 1995. COMPANY BACKGROUND AND HISTORY: Open Text's technology was developed at the University of Waterloo in a $ 6 million collaborative project, originally involving both government sources and the private sector, notably IBM and the Oxford University Press. When in 1990 it became apparent that the developed technology had commercial potential, Open Text Corporation was formed and the technology was acquired. Since that time, Open Text has enhanced and added to this technology which is now in use by more than 2,500 users worldwide. Open Text continues to maintain a close working relationship with the Center for Text Research at the University of Waterloo. In addition, Open Text is a leading participant in the Canadian Strategic Software Consortium, a nine company organization committed to the development of the harmonizing of text and relational database management systems (T/RDBMS). CANARIE Member

                            The Open Text 5 system is an integrated suite of client/server-
based text search, retrieval and viewing technologies, 
consisting of three components:

-	TextSearch - a high-speed database search engine based 
on the company's patented PAT string search technology, that 
enables users to rapidly locate, access and display full text, 
search individual words and phrases located in multiple 
databases and file formats. Unlike other systems TextSearch 
does not require that data be converted to a proprietary format. 
TextSearch has a multi-file/multi-format architecture which 
means that support is offered for searching both SGML and 
native file formats such as WordPerfect, MS Word, Interleaf, 
FrameMaker, Lotus 123, Excel, DBase etc.
-	TextQuery - a multi-platform, graphical user interface 
(GUI) that adheres to "progressive disclosure" principles. 
Beginners can quickly learn the product, while "power users" 
can enable additional features, expanding and  reconfiguring 
the GUI to reflect the new capabilities.
-	TextView - a viewing sub-system that automatically 
detects if data is to be viewed as "tagged text", such as SGML 
or HTML, or as one of 40 native file formats. Tagged text is 
displayed using user-defined style sheets, while native files 
are displayed exactly as they would appear in their original 
format.

                            Open Text Latitude is the company's newest product offering, 
and enables users to find, view and re-use information stored 
in documents, no matter how the documents are formatted or 
distributed across desktops and servers. Open Text Latitude 
consists of a number of integrated components including Open 
Text 5 and:

-	Open Text's Parallel Execution Monitor and Router 
(PEMR), for broadcasting concurrent searches across CD-ROM, 
LAN and WAN networks, and the Internet. A single user query 
is transparently routed by PEMR to all appropriate search areas.
-	a page viewer component which supports Common Ground  
and Adobe Acrobat.
-	IMAGEnation image technology from Spicer Corporation 
enabling users to view images associated with large format CAD 
and vector graphics engineering.
-	an SGML viewer, (for viewing and navigating within SGML 
documents).

Open Text Latitude was recently selected for an Award for 
Excellence at Seybold Seminars Boston 1995.

                            The Open Text 5 system is an integrated suite of client/server-
based text search, retrieval and viewing technologies, 
consisting of three components:

-	TextSearch - a high-speed database search engine based 
on the company's patented PAT string search technology, that 
enables users to rapidly locate, access and display full text, 
search individual words and phrases located in multiple 
databases and file formats. Unlike other systems TextSearch 
does not require that data be converted to a proprietary format. 
TextSearch has a multi-file/multi-format architecture which 
means that support is offered for searching both SGML and 
native file formats such as WordPerfect, MS Word, Interleaf, 
FrameMaker, Lotus 123, Excel, DBase etc.
-	TextQuery - a multi-platform, graphical user interface 
(GUI) that adheres to "progressive disclosure" principles. 
Beginners can quickly learn the product, while "power users" 
can enable additional features, expanding and  reconfiguring 
the GUI to reflect the new capabilities.
-	TextView - a viewing sub-system that automatically 
detects if data is to be viewed as "tagged text", such as SGML 
or HTML, or as one of 40 native file formats. Tagged text is 
displayed using user-defined style sheets, while native files 
are displayed exactly as they would appear in their original 
format.

                            Open Text Latitude is the company's newest product offering, 
and enables users to find, view and re-use information stored 
in documents, no matter how the documents are formatted or 
distributed across desktops and servers. Open Text Latitude 
consists of a number of integrated components including Open 
Text 5 and:

-	Open Text's Parallel Execution Monitor and Router 
(PEMR), for broadcasting concurrent searches across CD-ROM, 
LAN and WAN networks, and the Internet. A single user query 
is transparently routed by PEMR to all appropriate search areas.
-	a page viewer component which supports Common Ground  
and Adobe Acrobat.
-	IMAGEnation image technology from Spicer Corporation 
enabling users to view images associated with large format CAD 
and vector graphics engineering.
-	an SGML viewer, (for viewing and navigating within SGML 
documents).

Open Text Latitude was recently selected for an Award for 
Excellence at Seybold Seminars Boston 1995.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
