Benefits of OneLogin




Strengthen Security
Execute your identity policy across all users, devices, cloud and on-premise applications.





Reduce Costs
Automate processes, eliminate identity infrastructure costs, and deploy integrated applications in minutes.







Increase Productivity
Eliminate lengthy integration and provisioning projects, manual de-provisioning, password resets and Shadow IT policing.





Enterprise Growth
Empower users to get started quickly with the apps they need, while fully aligned with the identity policy.








Simplify Identity and Access Management for a More Secure Enterprise







Single Sign-on (SSO)
Real-time User Provisioning
Multi-factor Authentication
Unified Directory
Reporting





Single Sign-on (SSO)
With OneLogin’s single sign-on portal users only have to enter one set of credentials to access to their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets. This greatly increases productivity while keeping data secure.







Real-time User Provisioning
Automating the user provisioning lifecycle reduces errors and streamlines access control based on role, department, location, title and other attributes. Changes in Active Directory are synchronized to downstream applications within seconds, providing an effective user kill switch to help minimize exposure.







Multi-factor Authentication
Policy-based MFA prevents unauthorized users from accessing corporate data with passwords alone. OneLogin comes with its own MFA application, or you can use a pre integrated solution from Duo Security and many others to protect corporate data.







Unified Directory
OneLogin allows you to synchronize users with any number of directories, such as Active Directory, LDAP, Workday, or Google Apps. Import custom user attributes and pass them on to downstream apps via SAML or API-based provisioning. The integration with Active Directory synchronizes users in real-time and supports multiple forests and domains via a single connector.







Reporting
Reports give instant insight into login activity, application utilization, weak passwords, inactive users and more. Plus you can send app usage data to SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic to better investigate security incidents.













“What OneLogin does for us is, it gives us the security that we need, and still gives our users the flexibility that they want to choose those productive apps.”

Gary Graeff | Steelcase








“After an acquisition, OneLogin enabled us to get all new employees onboarded and collaborating in under one month. That was a huge win for us.”

AJ Tardio | Frontline Technologies








“The employee experience with OneLogin is, it’s one place for them to go to get into a portal of their apps.”

Matt Thorne | Pinterest

Benefits of OneLogin




Strengthen Security
Execute your identity policy across all users, devices, cloud and on-premise applications.





Reduce Costs
Automate processes, eliminate identity infrastructure costs, and deploy integrated applications in minutes.







Increase Productivity
Eliminate lengthy integration and provisioning projects, manual de-provisioning, password resets and Shadow IT policing.





Enterprise Growth
Empower users to get started quickly with the apps they need, while fully aligned with the identity policy.








Simplify Identity and Access Management for a More Secure Enterprise







Single Sign-on (SSO)
Real-time User Provisioning
Multi-factor Authentication
Unified Directory
Reporting





Single Sign-on (SSO)
With OneLogin’s single sign-on portal users only have to enter one set of credentials to access to their web apps in the cloud and behind the firewall – via desktops, smartphones and tablets. This greatly increases productivity while keeping data secure.







Real-time User Provisioning
Automating the user provisioning lifecycle reduces errors and streamlines access control based on role, department, location, title and other attributes. Changes in Active Directory are synchronized to downstream applications within seconds, providing an effective user kill switch to help minimize exposure.







Multi-factor Authentication
Policy-based MFA prevents unauthorized users from accessing corporate data with passwords alone. OneLogin comes with its own MFA application, or you can use a pre integrated solution from Duo Security and many others to protect corporate data.







Unified Directory
OneLogin allows you to synchronize users with any number of directories, such as Active Directory, LDAP, Workday, or Google Apps. Import custom user attributes and pass them on to downstream apps via SAML or API-based provisioning. The integration with Active Directory synchronizes users in real-time and supports multiple forests and domains via a single connector.







Reporting
Reports give instant insight into login activity, application utilization, weak passwords, inactive users and more. Plus you can send app usage data to SIEM tools like Splunk and Elastic to better investigate security incidents.













“What OneLogin does for us is, it gives us the security that we need, and still gives our users the flexibility that they want to choose those productive apps.”

Gary Graeff | Steelcase








“After an acquisition, OneLogin enabled us to get all new employees onboarded and collaborating in under one month. That was a huge win for us.”

AJ Tardio | Frontline Technologies








“The employee experience with OneLogin is, it’s one place for them to go to get into a portal of their apps.”

Matt Thorne | Pinterest

Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
