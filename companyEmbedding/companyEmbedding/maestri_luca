Luca Maestri’s Route To Apple CFO

Reuters
Luca Maestri, incoming CFO of Apple


When Luca Maestri left his chief financial officer job at Xerox in 2013 to be controller at Apple Inc. it could have been a risky move. C-level executives rarely want to move down the corporate totem pole. But with Tuesday’s news that Mr. Maestri will replace long-time Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer, the bet has paid off.
Mr. Maestri’s route to CFO of the world’s most valuable company took several turns, including more than seven international assignments and several stints in the CFO chair at some of the world’s biggest companies.
After working his way up through General Motors over 20 years, Mr. Maestri left the carmaker as CFO of its European operations. He headed straight for the C-suite of technology firms with complex manufacturing operations, including CFO of Nokia Siemens Networks and then Xerox.
“I knew they were grooming him [at  Apple],” said Nick Cyprus, the former controller at General Motors who worked with Mr. Maestri.
Mr. Maestri’s former colleagues describe the Italian-born executive as collegial and bright, a supportive manager with a deep understanding of business operations.
Mr. Cyprus said he first met Mr. Maestri when he joined the company and worked on a project to overhaul the company’s accounting functions.
“We needed to make change fast and Luca was more of an asset than a liability,” Mr. Cyprus said.
When Mr. Cyprus asked Mr. Maestri to make changes in the Europe division, he says, “Luca turned around and said if that’s what you need to be successful, I’m behind you.”
In GM’s Europe operation, Mr. Maestri oversaw some difficult issues during the financial crisis as the company hurtled toward a major restructuring. There were tense union negotiations and the overhaul of a complex strategy to boost sales in Europe.
“He was one of the guys who had been around for a while and worked his way up,” Mr. Cyprus said. “He’s really good to work for. He gets controls. He gets infrastructure. He’s a team player.
Mr. Maestri was at Xerox less than two years, but he made an impression by helping the printer and copier company expand into business services.
“One of his big strengths was that he listened,” said Gary Kabureck, a former chief accounting officer at Xerox. “He wanted to understand, and he listened and asked questions until he did understand.”
Xerox, had been looking for a CFO, with extensive international experience to replace long-time CFO Larry Zimmerman. Mr. Maestri fit the bill, having spent a number of years working outside the United States. Mr. Kabureck recalled overhearing him speak on the phone with colleagues in Brazil in clear Portuguese.
“He absolutely understood business processes, from supply chain to currency, and he brought a lot to the table,” Mr. Kabureck said. “He was a good find for Xerox, and a loss when he left.”

Implementing the New Revenue Standard Raises Challenges Beyond Accounting
With less than six months left for public companies with calendar year-ends to implement the FASB’s new revenue standard, some organizations still seem to be grappling with implementation challenges. Some changes have broad accounting implications and will likely require many organizations to apply more judgment to accounting decisions than in the past, while other changes to the standard may spill over into operations, affecting human resources, IT, and sales and marketing. Eric Knachel and Dennis Howell, both with Deloitte & Touche LLP, discuss issues for organizations to consider as they implement the new standard.

Apple's CFO explained why its research and development costs increased to $2.8 billion

Apple CFO Luca Maestri.Alex Grimm/Reuters
Apple spent $2.8 billion (£2.2 billion) on research and development in its most recent quarter, and $10.39 billion (£8.36 billion) through 2016, according to its fourth quarter earnings report.
Analysis of Apple's quarterly earnings over time show that annual spend is its highest ever.
According to chief financial officer Luca Maestri, research and development spend is Apple's biggest differentiator from the competition, and stems from the company's expansion into new areas.
Speaking at the Goldman Sachs investor conference on Tuesday, Maestri said Apple was "working on things that do not generate revenue today" but might be good future bets. Apple made the interview available through its investor relations site.
Maestri didn't go into specifics, but rumoured projects on the books include the Apple Car and augmented reality glasses.
Apple's suite of products is much larger than it used to be, Maestri added. "We make three iPhones, we only used to develop one. We develop multiple iPods, the Apple Watch, Airpods, Beats headphones. The product portfolio is larger, so we need more R&D [budget] to develop these."
The company is spending more on its growing services business, which includes the App Store and iTunes. "Services has grown a lot," Maestri said during the interview. "We need engineering investments in services like iCloud, Siri, Maps. R&D on services is significantly higher than we used to have." Services jumped by almost $1 billion (£804 million) in revenue this last quarter, to $7.17 billion (£5.8 billion).
Finally, there's Apple's increased focus on bringing core technologies in-house. Maestri said:
"[R&D spend] allows us to keep our differentiation from the rest of the industry. Today, we do much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than we did a few years ago...think about the work we do around processors, sensors, there's much more work in-house than we used to do. It means we can push the envelope on innovation, we have better control over timing, cost, quality. We look at that as a great strategic investment for us."
Apple opened an R&D centre in Israel focused on chip development in 2015, and new centres are set to open in Yokohoma in Japan, Jakarta in Indonesia, and an unspecified location in China.

4 Reasons Why Apple's R&D Spending Is On the Rise, According to CFO Luca Maestri
Will the Apple Toaster/Fridge ever see the light of day?











                Evan Niu, CFA
            

                (TMFNewCow)



            
            Feb 16, 2017 at 5:35PM
            
            





One key trend that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) investors have taken note of recently is the company's precipitous rise in research and development spending. As a percentage of revenue, Apple's R&D expenditures would historically stay within a 2% to 4% range, but in recent years this has climbed to 4% to 6%. That translates into an awful lot of spending in dollar terms when you factor in Apple's growing top line (2016 notwithstanding).
The most obvious explanation is that Apple is investing in future products that it won't talk about yet, which it certainly is doing. But that's just one of four different reasons why Apple's R&D investments have grown. CFO Luca Maestri spoke at the Goldman Sachs Technology and Internet Conference 2017 earlier this week, and he laid out why this line item on the income statement continues to grow.

Image source: Apple.

1. A growing product portfolio
Apple has always prioritized product depth over product breadth, which has historically helped contribute to R&D cost discipline. Even as the company still only offers a handful of devices within each product family, far fewer than some of its more prolific rivals, the portfolio is still expanding:

The first one is the fact that our product portfolio today is much larger than it used to be. We now develop three iPhones. We used to develop one. We develop multiple iPads. We used to develop one. We now have the Watch. We've got AirPods. We have Beats. So the product portfolio is larger, and obviously, we need more R&D to develop those programs.

2. Investing in services
The Mac maker has grand ambitions of doubling its services business over the next four years. But even now, the current growth that the services business is enjoying requires a lot of investment in order to scale across Apple's massive user base.

The second element is that the Services business has grown a lot. And to grow the business, we need to make engineering investments in services like iCloud, like Siri, like Maps. And so clearly, the spend -- R&D spend that we have on services is significantly higher than we used to have. 






3. More in-house development
This is perhaps the most important: Apple has in-sourced the development of many core technologies. The most meaningful of which being its A-series of processors, and designing processors is incredibly expensive. But doing so gives Apple greater control over its product roadmaps, instead of being at the mercy of suppliers' roadmaps. For instance, the Mac is still very much dependent on Intel's roadmap.

The third reason, I think, is a very strategic one and a very important one that allows us  to keep our differentiation from the rest of the industry, and it's the fact that today, we do much more in-house development of some fundamental technologies than we used to do a few years ago, when we were leaving more of that to the supplier base. Think of the work that we do around processors or sensors, right? Much more work than we're doing today in-house than we used to. It's very important  for us because we can push the envelope on innovation. We have better control over timing, over cost, over quality. And so we look at that as a great strategic investment for us, right?

4. Future products
And of course, as mentioned above, Apple is investing in future products that aren't contributing to the top line quite yet.

And then finally, it's the point of view we're making around the fact that, yes, we're also working on things that do not generate revenue today. And those expenses are meaningful, and the products, being of things that are not very large, but obviously, they add up over time. And hopefully, those are good bets that we're making for the future of the company.

Whether the pipeline includes a self-driving electric car, an augmented reality headset, or that mythical toaster/fridge remains to be seen. I'm still keeping my fingers crossed on the latter.

Luca Maestri: Apple Watch Revenue ‘Well Over’ $952 Million

The AP:

Some analysts noted that Apple reported $2.6 billion in revenue
from the company’s “Other Products” segment, which includes the
watch. That’s about $952 million more than the previous quarter,
when the watch had not yet gone on sale, or significantly less
than the $1.8 billion in watch sales that analysts surveyed by
FactSet were expecting.
But Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told The Associated Press
that revenue from the watch amounted to “well over” that $952
million increase. He said the watch sales were offset by declining
revenue from iPods and accessories, which are also lumped into
that segment.

As Dan Seifert tweeted (one and two), this means Apple Watch already generates more revenue than Microsoft Surface — which was up 117 percent:

While the company’s stumbles in smartphones have shown the
bruising downsides of the hardware business for Microsoft, it had
success with other devices, including its Surface tablet, the
revenue from which grew 117 percent, to $888 million. Revenue from
its Xbox game business rose 27 percent. In total, Microsoft said
it had nearly $2 billion in computing and gaming hardware revenue
in the quarter.
