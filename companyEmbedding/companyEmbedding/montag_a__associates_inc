Consensus Ratings for Time (NYSE:TIME) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 4 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.20)Consensus Price Target: $15.20 (6.29% upside)

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $52.77 (3.82% upside)

What are analysts saying about Colgate-Palmolive Company stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Colgate-Palmolive Company stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Colgate has outperformed the broader sector over the past six months. The company has been witnessing enhanced margins for a while now, driven by cost-savings from the funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program. Also, better pricing and emerging market growth have boosted performance amid a tough macro environment. This was evident from the earnings beat reported in first-quarter 2017. Further, Colgate-Palmolive’s growth strategy has been largely guided by innovation and in-store implementation, enabling it to capture market share across all reagions and categories. However, the company's sales trend remains soft due to currency woes. Management expects adverse currency and a tough global environment to impact 2017 results, as reflected by its outlook. Nonetheless, organic sales are expected to improve sequentially throughout the year. Also, Colgate’s shareholder-friendly moves are noteworthy." (7/4/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Late Tues. (5/16), the NY Post reported that CL Chair/CEO Ian Cook recently told investors he would consider selling the company for $100/share (~19.5x EV/EBITDA). While we have no knowledge of any potential M&A or the specific accuracy of this report, this strikes us as a reasonable price (for both a potential buyer and for CL as sellers). We view JNJ as the most likely acquirer, followed by ULVR and KHC/3G. Valuation remains nearly full, reit. $76 PT, Hold. CL CEO/Chairman Ian Cook reportedly would consider selling for $100/share: Late Tuesday, the NY Post reported the Ian Cook, Colgate’s Chairman and CEO, recently signaled he would be open to selling the company… for $100/share", while at a meeting with institutional investors. The Post further noted recent speculation the CL is being stalked by" Unilever and pointed to activist Nelson Peltz’s stake in P&G as a potential spark for sector consolidation." (5/17/2017)
3. B. Riley analysts commented, "Colgate (CL) reported 4Q16 EPS of $0.75 vs. $0.73, in line with consensus and $0.01 below our estimate.  Op. profit of $1,038MM (+2% YoY) fell short of consensus of $1,071MM.  Organic sales were +1.5% (+4.6% exp.), with organic volume -1%'this was only the second quarter since 2002 with an organic volume decline for CL.  Volume was impacted by the India demonetization and a distributor issue in Africa/ Eurasia; organic volume was up in only one of the six segments.  CL expects organic sales +4% in 2017, and cut EPS guidance from up double-digits to up low-single digits, due to FX and lower category growth rates.  We are lowering our 2017E/2018E EPS by $0.20 each to $2.90/$3.20 and our PT from $78.00 to $74.00, based on 23x 2018E EPS of $3.20.  While 3% EPS growth in 2017 looks achievable (even conservative), we are concerned by how much marketing investment, and competitive 'catching up,' is implied.  If interest rates go higher in 2017, staples stocks may have a tough time outperforming, but we view Procter & Gamble (PG; Buy; $106.00 PT) as more attractive than CL, because PG's organic sales growth is driving higher toward 3%, while CL's has been decelerating.  As the gap continues to narrow between CL's and PG's organic sales growth rates, we think investors will become increasingly attracted to PG.  The two stocks' valuations are similar on EV-to-EBITDA."
