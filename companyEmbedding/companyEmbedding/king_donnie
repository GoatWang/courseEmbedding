            COMMENTEMAILMOREEAST LANSING – Michigan State’s coaching staff, for the second straight recruiting cycle, identified wide receiver as a position of need.There is no doubt Donnie Corley has become the leader of a young and talented group. The question is, can this crop rival the pass catchers Mark Dantonio’s program had during the Spartans’ 2013 Big Ten championship and Rose Bowl season?“I have to lead them,” MSU wide receivers coach Terrence Samuel said this week. “It’s just like where we were in 2012. All those things that group had to deal with in 2012 with, ‘How do I deal with this, how do I deal with that?’ The media pressure, catching the balls getting bumped, ‘How do I study film?’ I’m having to teach Donnie how to do those things, I’m having to teach all these young guys how to do those things. And it’s a process.”That 2012 team – which included junior Bennie Fowler; sophomores Tony Lippett and Keith Mumphery; and freshman Aaron Burbridge – struggled with drops on hard throws from first-year starting quarterback Andrew Maxwell. MSU’s offense sputtered, Maxwell lost his job to Connor Cook the following season, and those NFL-bound receivers began to shine.The Spartans lose R.J. Shelton and Monty Madaris from their receiving corps from a year ago, bringing in a four-wideout freshman class of C.J. Hayes, Laress Nelson, Hunter Rison and Cody White.“I think we were really smart with the kids we were recruiting and making sure, personality-wise, that they wanted to be Spartans. And they bought in,” Samuel said. “Cody wanted to be a Spartan, Hunter wanted to be a Spartan. Even C.J. wanted to be a Spartan – this was his dream school. So they’re committed to the program getting better. There’s a difference when a kid comes in and he’s just looking for himself and looking for his stats versus these kids that want the program to progress.”FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInPhotos: Michigan State's 2017 football recruits FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Like Corley, Trishton Jackson earned experience as a true freshman a year ago, and Darrell Stewart also saw time as a redshirt freshman. Cam Chambers took a redshirt, and fellow true freshman Justin Layne moved from receiver to cornerback.“We wanted to take four this year, last year having taken four great receivers,” Dantonio said on Signing Day. “We felt like we needed to take four. I think we answered a lot. We got some versatility in that group in terms of the type of wide receivers we were able to bring with us.”Related:Spartans' Justin Layne and Donnie Corley quite the duo -- for nowBut everyone realizes Corley is the burgeoning star.Unlike his predecessors who went on to greatness eventually, the 6-foot-2, 186-pound Corley immediately made an impact on the Spartans’ offense and earned a spot on the Football Writers Association of America’s Freshman All-America Team as an all-purpose player, and rookie honors at receiver by both BTN.com and ESPN.com.The Detroit King High product got a few carries on jet sweeps, dabbled at defensive back (five tackles in four games), played on a number of special teams and got a few return game reps. But he became the secondary pass-catching option behind senior Shelton almost immediately, even with continual instability at quarterback.Michigan State Spartans freshman Donnie Corley lays a big hit on Rutgers tight end Matt Flanagan in the first half at Spartan Stadium on Nov. 12, 2016. (Photo: Dave Wasinger, LSJ)Corley’s 453 receiving yards are the most in MSU history by a true freshman, and his 33 catches are second to only running back Sedrick Irvin in 1996. His 496 all-purpose yards were third on the Spartans a year ago, and it included seven plays of 20-plus yards.Samuel feels Corley is farther ahead than even Burbridge was during his true freshman season, saying he “should’ve had 1,000” receiving yards last year. His coach believes the time Corley spent on defense showed him better ways to perform at receiver, much like Lippett’s two-way duties did his senior season. The techniques and schemes Corley digested rapidly as a rookie also should become more innate as he moves into his sophomore season, which Samuel said should allow him to focus more on the nuances of being a No. 1 receiver.“I expect him to play on a whole other level,” Samuel said. “Yes, he can be that. It’s rough to say – better than Tony, better than Burb. This is just a throwing-it-out there type situation, my opinion. But he can be.”“These guys, Donnie is the one who’s played a lot. He put a freshman year, he did really well. Could’ve done a lot of things better, and I think he’s addressed a lot of those things. Hopefully, if I’m teaching him the right way, we’ll see the progress.”Related:Whom to watch in Michigan State's 2017 football recruiting classContact Chris Solari: csolari@freepress.com.
