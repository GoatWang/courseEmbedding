Harbor MedTech Announces Interim Results of the Architect® Method of Action Study by the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University
Mar 23, 2016 | 
 

Harbor MedTech Announces Interim Results of the Architect® Method of Action Study by the Wexner Medical Center at The Ohio State University
Irvine, California – March 17, 2016.   Harbor MedTech, Inc. announced today the interim results of a Method of Action Study of its Architect® Stabilized Collagen Matrix by the Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cell Based Therapies at the Wexner Medical Center of The Ohio State University.  Architect® is the only stabilized wound matrix available to treat complex and chronic skin wounds such as Diabetic Foot Ulcers, Venous Leg Ulcers, Pressure Ulcers, and many other serious skin wounds.
In a poster presentation by Drs. Shomita Steiner, Piya Ghatak, Amitava Das, Sashwati Roy, and led by Dr. Chandan Sen, Dr. Steiner stated that preliminary observations support the belief that Architect® improves wound closure by providing a stable scaffold while serving as a catalyst for human keratinocytes and macrophages, two of the most important cell types essential for wound healing.  Dr. Steiner also noted that Architect® appeared to stimulate patient’s anti-microbial peptide (AMP) defense system in the wound.
Chandan K. Sen, PhD, Professor of Surgery and Director of The Ohio State University’s Center for Regenerative Medicine and Cell Based Therapies, praised the work of Dr. Steiner’s team and added “What we are seeing with Architect® are wound healing activities we have not seen with other products.  Although these are early data, we seem to be on a path that could lead to a novel mechanism of action by a wound dressing.”
Jerry Mezger, President of Harbor MedTech, said “We are very pleased with the work being done at The Ohio State University.  With the excellent clinical results we see every day with Architect®, and the published studies indicating faster wound healing by Architect®, we are gratified to learn how stabilizing the collagen matrix in Architect® yields such terrific results.”

Successful Treatment of Recalcitrant Foot Ulcer
Phoenix, AZ
54 y.o. male with type-2 diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral artery disease with history of a persistent DFU that was seen as a 2nd opinion to toe amputation.  The DFU presented with necrotic tissue, debris, mild drainage and required off-loading shoes.  Several different modalities and therapeutic approaches were used over the past 2.5 years including skin substitutes and grafts.
Following sharp debridement and 1 application of Architect® Stabilized Collagen Matrix, the wound was completely closed within 8 weeks.
 
 
 





Pre-Application
Persistent Diabetic Leg Ulcer, not healed after 2.5 years of treatment, including several other skin substitutes and grafts.
 
 




4 Weeks Post-Op
Progress of wound closure was excellent by week 4. Outer dressings were removed and wound was cleaned with sterile saline and redressed with Architect®, Steri-Strips®, and moistened gauze.
 
 




8 Weeks Post-Op
Wound had completely closed and the remaining remnant of Architect® was removed.  The patient was seen two weeks later and the wound remained closed.
 
 
 



Successful Treatment of a 4-Year Recalcitrant Broken Glass Foot Wound
Phoenix, AZ
35 y.o. female patient lacerated the plantar surface of her right foot with glass.  During the course of four years, the wound has undergone multiple procedures including incisions and drainage, rotational skin grafts, and treatments of advanced wound-healing products.  The wound remained open with no progression toward healing.  Following a course of doxycycline, and 1 application of Architect®, the wound was closed in 10 days.  
 
 
 





Pre-Application
4 Year old full-thickness plantar right food wound.  No neuropathy noted and pedal pulses intact.
Architect® was packed into the wound appendages for complete wound coverage and secured in place with Steri-Strips® and pressure dressings to prevent shifting of the graft.
The foot was off-loaded with a trauma shoe.  The patient was instructed on daily dressing changes and not to get the foot wet.
 
 




10 Days Post-Op
Patient returned 10 days later with complete closure of the recalcitrant wound. Steri-Strips® were still in place upon arrival to the office.
No additional debridement was necessary, though thick surrounding callus was debrided.
Patient returned 12 days later and wound remained closed.
 
 
 



Successful Treatment of a Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcer
Progression of the Stabilized ECM during a 9 week period. The DFU was healed with just 1 application.
 
 
 





Pre-Application
Chronic DFU. Wound was debrided prior to application of the Stabilized ECM, sutured around the edges followed by moistened saline dressings and off-loading.
 
 




1 Week Post-Op
Stabilized ECM is dry along the edges and moist in the middle.
*Maintaining intimate contact with the wound bed is recommended.
 
 




3 Weeks Post-Op
Stabilized ECM is visibly smaller and dry along the edges.
*Hanging edges may be trimmed as wound closes.
 
 




4 Weeks Post-Op
Wound edges are visibly smaller.
*Maintaining appropriate moisture balance is recommended.
 
 
 





5 Weeks Post-Op
Stabilized ECM still smaller and sutures were removed by physician.
*Sutures may be removed upon clinical discretion as the wound edges recede.
 
 




7 Weeks Post-Op
Stabilized ECM was no longer attached, wound continued to be off-loaded with saline dressings.
 
 




9 Weeks Post-Op
Final follow-up, wound fully closed with 1 Application.
 
 
 



Successful Treatment of Recalcitrant Venous Leg Ulcer
Tempe, AZ
82 y.o. female with 2 year old Venous Leg Ulcer.  Previous treatment with human skin substitute failed.  The VLU was healed in 12 weeks with just 1 application of Architect®.
 
 
 





Pre-Application
Venus Leg Ulcer, not healed after 2 years of treatment, including human cellular products.
 
 




2 Weeks Post-Op
Architect® secured using Steri-Strips®.
 
 




12 Weeks Post-Op
Wound Healed with 1 Application of Architect®.
 
 
 



Diabetic Foot Ulcer with Exposed Bone
Lafayette, LA
68 y.o. male with plantar DFU.  DFU was healed in 9 weeks with just 1 application of Architect®.
 
 
 





Pre-Application
Diabetic Foot Ulcer with Exposed Bone.
 
 




9 Weeks Post-Op
Wound Healed with 1 Application of Architect®.
 
 
 




 
 
 


Stabilized ECM vs. Human Allograft on a Vasculitic Ulcer
San Diego, CA, 4
56 y.o. male with bilateral, medial, and lateral foot ulcers associated with cryoglobulinemia, vasculitis, and severe inflammation.  Additional patient medical history showed renal insufficiency, hepatitis C, depressive disorder NEC, insomnia, hypertension, and hypogonadism.
The patient’s wounds had been present for more than 1 year, unresponsive to all forms of conservative therapy and gradually increasing in size.  Previous wound treatments included topical alginates, collagen dressings, collagenase, petrolatum gauze, and moist saline gauze.  All previous topical therapies had failed.
 
Half of the wound was covered with a Human Allograft based product, with the other half covered by a Stabilized ECM.

After 16 weeks of treatment, the wound treated with the Human Allograft based product remained open with no healing properties remaining after 4th week.
Just 1 application healed the wound in 14 weeks.

 


An optimally stabilized collagen-based xenograft, by its ability to withstand the destructive activity of proteolytic enzymes, appears able to create an environment conducive to healing. It is conceivable that the stabilized collagen (in the xenograft) reduced the rate and length of the inflammatory processes associated with continued presence of digested collagen eptides…
The reduction in pain experienced by this patient also suggests a role played by the biologic in altering additional inflammatory processes in the wound bed, a significant consideration when treating asculitic ulcers.
As Mulder et al stated. ³

 
 
 
 




Initial Pre-Op Presentation
Left foot medial side, presenting high levels of pain as well as extensive tissue and underlying tendon necrosis.

The Roll of ECMs in Wound Healing?
 
 
 





Magnified image of an ECM
 



What makes up an ECM?
 
 

Extracellular Matrix’s (ECM’s) are a complex meshwork of structural and functional proteins, including collagens and integrins, glycoproteins, hyaluronan, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that provide structure and support for cells and tissues.  Collagen is one of the major constituents of the ECM existing in many different types depending on the tissue and often forming fibres.  Fibronectin and laminin are two other protein constituents of the ECM.
ECMs stimulate and support cell proliferation’s essential for tissue regeneration by: ¹,²

Acting as a reservoir for growth factors and cytokines that are crucial to tissue regeneration.
Supporting and regulating the movement of cells.
Cell signaling to trigger and modulate the wound healing cascade.

ECMs are commonly used as “skin substitutes” because of these important tissue regeneration properties. Unfortunately, in chronic wounds, ECMs are susceptible to rapid degradation by an excess of various enzymes such as matrix metalloprotease (MMPs) and other proteases. ³
 
 
 




“The unifying pathophysiological hypothesis for chronic wounds is that the inflammatory phase of healing is exaggerated, with the excess of proteases and MMPs in chronic wounds breaking down too many components of the ECM as well as inhibiting growth factors that are essential for tissue synthesis.”
As Muller et al stated.4


 
 
 
In addition, chronic wounds can also have an elevated neutrophil (PMNs) infiltration in response to persistent bacterial infections, which further exaggerates the ECM-degrading environment. 5
 
 




 
 


Ultimately, many researchers have concluded that “continued degradation of an ECM-based dressing . . . exacerbates this inflammatory environment, further delaying healing.” This is the problem we are addressing with Architect® .
 
Architect® is the only ECM stabilized by the BriDGE® process which prevents premature degradation by the excess MMPs and other proteases found in chronic wounds. Because Architect® remains intact, its ECM healing properties remain intact, including:

Helping to deactivate the inflammatory phase (which results in a reduction of MMPs, elastase, and other proteases).
Helping to promote the proliferative/healing phase.
Preserving cell signaling factors to trigger and accelerate healing.
Providing an intact, durable scaffold for uninterrupted support of cellular growth and regeneration of native tissue.

 
How is Architect different from all other ECM-based Wound Care products?
 
 
 


Virtually all skin substitutes used for treating chronic skin wounds are simply ECM’s in one form or another.  The challenge faced by other ECM’s is their rapid degradation by the excess MMPs and other proteases found in chronic wounds.  Not only does rapid ECM degradation potentially extend the inflammatory phase, it requires continual replacement of the ECM to support cellular ingrowth (up to 12 applications in some cases).  Timing the replacement of a degraded ECM is critical, otherwise healing stalls.
Because Architect® remains intact, its ECM healing properties remain active, causing tissue regeneration to take place:

Architect® helps to deactivate the inflammatory phase (which results in a reduction of MMPs, elastase, and other proteases).
Architect® serves as a catalyst in the proliferative/healing phase, serving as a homing base for Autologous growth factors (epithelial, fibroblasts, endothelial, immune cells, etc.), creating a gradient for pro-healing cues.
Architect® preserves cell signaling factors to trigger an accelerate healing.
Architect® provides an intact, durable scaffold for uninterrupted support of cellular growth and regeneration of native tissue.
Architect® strengthens anti-microbial defenses such as antimicrobial peptides (AMP).
AND these properties are uninterrupted for the duration of treatment.

 
 




Why does Architect®  show faster healing?
Because BriDGE®  Stabilized ECM’s do not stall!
 



 
 


 
 


What is Architect made of?
Architect® is made from a widely available Xenograft commonly used in modern tissue heart valves and many other medical products.  This tissue is strong, homogeneous (over 95% type 1 collagen), durable and porous, making it an ideal wound matrix to support cellular in-growth throughout the healing process.
 
 




Magnified (tri-layered) cross section
 
 
 


How is Architect used?
Architect® can be applied to a wound immediately after thorough debridement (no need to wait 4-6 weeks as required for many other products) and Architect® is designed to require only one application to the wound.  In most cases Architect® is applied directly to the properly prepared wound bed, secured to the perimeter of the wound with sutures, staples, or tape (e.g. Steri-Strip®), and a surgical bandage is applied to ensure continual contact of Architect® to the wound bed.  During proper healing, as the wound margins recede, the excess edges of Architect® is trimmed away until the wound finally heals and the remaining portion of Architect® falls off.
 
Is Architect Convenient?
 
 
 





 

No skin substitute is more convenient than Architect.

Architect® is stored at room temperature in easy to use double peel packs (no complex refrigeration or special equipment required).
Architect® can be re-hydrated for use in a matter of minutes for quick and easy application (no complex thawing or preparation procedures).
Architect® is strong enough to secure to the wound using sutures, staples, or tape (e.g. Steri-Strip®) ensuring the product remains in place.
Architect® is terminally sterilized (not just “aseptically processed”).
Architect® requires only ONE application (no need for invasive re-applications / debridements).
Architect® is a sterile FDA Cleared Medical Device (meaning no Human Tissue  (HCT/P) / or Biologic tracking is required.)

 
 
 




The ultimate convenience is the fact that Architect
does NOT require re-application.
*or additional debridements


 
 
 
While most alternative products require weekly re-application (often in a surgical setting and requiring additional debridement), Architect® recommends periodic inspection of the secondary dressing (and secondary dressing change as needed to manage exudates) and maintain good hydration of Architect®.   As healing occurs, the edges of Architect® may gradually peel and be trimmed during dressing changes.
There is NO need for re-application (or additional debridement), in most cases.  This makes Architect® the right choice for Doctors, Nurses, and Wound Care professionals who seek to provide their patients with the best quality of care and convenience available.
 
Is Architect cost effective?
Architect® is very cost effective.  The cost of Architect® is similar to one application of the leading wound matrices.  But clinical studies indicate that the major cost advantage of Architect® comes from its stabilized collagen . . . Architect® will typically require as few as one application (see below) compared to 4‑12 applications for the leading wound matrices.

Harbor MedTech, Inc. is a fully integrated, commercial-stage regenerative medicine company. We currently have two FDA-cleared and CE marked products and a broad pipeline, all leveraging our patented BriDGE® technology.
 
The BriDGE® Process transforms standard type-1 collagen into a bio-friendly, stabilized collagen matrix which acts as a trigger to activate the patient’s own healing cascade.
 

Early Mechanism of Action work performed by Dr. Chandan Sen, at the Regenerative Medicine Center at The Ohio State University, on our first BriDGE® technology product, Architect®, has been shown to accelerate wound healing and limit the formation of biofilm often in a single application.
 
Our product pipeline uses the BriDGE® platform to create innovative solutions for unmet needs in breast reconstruction, hernia repair, Achilles tendon and rotator cuff repair, wounds, and many other applications in dermatology, general surgery, and plastic surgery.
