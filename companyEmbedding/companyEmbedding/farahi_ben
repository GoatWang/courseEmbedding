John, Bob, and Ben Farahi


Business — 24 March 2011






Brothers John Farahi, Bob Farahi, and Ben Farahi own 48 percent of Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. All three are co-chairs of the company, with John serving as chief executive officer and chief operating officer, Bob as president, and Ben as chief financial officer.
Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc. owns and operates the Atlantis Casino Resort in Reno, Nevada, through its lone subsidiary, Golden Road Motor Inn, Inc. The Atlantis is a tropically themed hotel and casino adorned with such tropical décor as giant artificial palm trees, thatched roof huts, and waterfalls. The property includes three high-rise hotel towers, containing 831 rooms and suites, as well as a low-rise motor lodge with 149 rooms that appeal to value conscious guests. The 51,000-square-foot casino offers nearly 1,500 slot and video poker machines, 37 table games, and a sports book operation run by an outside party. The Atlantis also provides several restaurants, a health spa, indoor and outdoor pools, a full-service salon for men and women, retail establishments, a family entertainment center, and banquet, convention, and meeting room space. Monarch owns 16 acres of adjacent land that is available for further development, but in the meantime is used for parking, which is connected to the Atlantis by the “Sky Terrace,” supported by two 100-foot-tall Grecian columns. The Sky Terrace also maintains a tropical look and contains banks of slot and video poker machines, a comfortable lounge, oyster bar, and sushi bar. While clearly appealing to leisure travelers, the Atlantis also caters to area gaming customers by offering more slot and video poker machines with higher than average payout rates and liberalized rules at blackjack. Much of the success of the Atlantis is due to its location, several miles from Reno’s downtown casinos and the only hotel within walking distance of the Reno Convention Center, which supplies a steady stream of fresh customers.
Monarch traces its history to 1972, when the father of the company’s co-chairmen, David Farahi and his brother-in-law, Isaac Poura, bought a rundown 142-room motel called the Golden Door Motel located on four acres of leased property on the southern edge of Reno. It was well removed from the bulk of the tourist trade that frequented the downtown casinos. The facility’s only tangible asset was its close proximity to the city’s convention center, which provided enough business, along with overflow guests from downtown hotels during peak times, to barely keep the enterprise afloat. The Golden Door was a two-story low-rise structure with an adjoining building that housed the lobby, a coffee shop, banquet room, and lounge. Because it was part of the Golden Door chain, the name was changed to the Golden Road Motel. John Farahi, a political science graduate from California State University, Hayward, soon went to work for the motel and during summer vacations from college he was helped by his brothers. Bob would earn a biochemistry degree from the University of California at Berkeley, and Ben received a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California at Berkeley as well as an M.B.A. degree in accounting from California State University, Hayward. Over the next several years all three sons would eventually come to work for the business on a full-time basis. Poura would not be with the company, however. The two brothers-in-law proved incompatible business partners and in mid-1973 David Farahi bought out Poura. In 1976, with his sons having taken on so much of the responsibility for running the business, he transferred ownership to them and their sister Jila.

David (Davoud) Farahi


Obituary
Condolences


































 David (Davoud) FarahiFeb. 13, 1916June 24, 2012David (Davoud) Farahi was born in Tehran, Iran on February 13, 1916, into an observant Jewish family. He was the third of six children. His father worked as a tailor and his mother was a homemaker. David studied pharmacy and graduated from the University of Tehran. He became an entrepreneur who succeeded in many varied business ventures, starting as distributor of medical supplies. With his business partners, he developed one of the largest chicken hatcheries in the Middle East, and also manufactured carpets and latex products. He later moved on to real estate development and construction. David immigrated to the U.S. in 1970, and initially lived in the San Francisco Bay area. He loved and appreciated his life in the United States and taught his family that America is a blessed land of opportunity. David was the patriarch of his extended family. He deeply cared about the welfare of his loved ones and they frequently sought his wise advice. He believed in giving back to his community and frequently reminded those around him to fully appreciate the freedoms guaranteed to Americans. In 1972 a real estate agent introduced David to a business opportunity located on the southern outskirts of Reno, Nevada. It was a 142-room motor lodge and coffee shop named Golden Door. David purchased it, and it was run initially under his ownership as the Golden Road Motel. Eventually the motel was transferred to the ownership of David's children, and with David's vision and guidance, the property ultimately became today's Atlantis Casino Resort Spa, a premier destination resort. In addition to his interest in business and love for family, David was an active member of Reno's Temple Emanuel and the United Jewish Appeal. In 2009 the David and Parvin Farahi Jewish Day School opened at the Aleph Academy in Reno, named in honor of David and his wife. David passed on peacefully at home in Reno on June 24, 2012, surrounded by his loving family. In accordance with his wishes, David was laid to rest in the Holy City of Jerusalem, Israel, on June 27, in the presence of his family and friends. He is survived by his wife of 64 years, Parvin; son John and wife Catherine; son Bahram ("Bob") and wife Parinaz; son Behrouz ("Ben") and wife Susan (all of Reno); daughter Jila and husband Joseph (of Los Angeles); sister Moluk Saeedi (of Los Angeles); brother Abraham (of Reno); and his twelve adoring grandchildren, all born in Reno.A memorial service will be held on Tuesday July 10th at 5:30 p.m. at Temple Emanuel, located at the corner of Lakeside and Manzanita Ln.
