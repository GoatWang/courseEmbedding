WEST LINN, Ore.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Radiant Health Management Corp, which opened the first of 100 planned 
      Radiant Pain Relief Centres in February 2014 in West Linn, named Chris 
      Roberts chief financial officer, a newly formed role for the growing 
      company. Mr. Roberts started his career at KPMG, and most recently 
      served as a senior partner and controller at Vancouver, Wash.-based 
      Audigy Group, where he was part of the executive management team that 
      led growth from $600,000 in revenue in 2005 to approximately $32 million 
      in 2014. During that time, the company established itself as one of the 
      most influential companies in the hearing care industry, and has been 
      ranked numerous times for its growth by various American City Business 
      Journals, Inc. magazine, and others. The Portland Business 
      Journal named Roberts small company CFO of the Year in 2009, 
      and 40 under 40 in 2012.
    


      “We believe that the demand for non-surgical, non-narcotic pain relief 
      in North America, a $600 billion market, presents our business with both 
      an opportunity and a responsibility for an aggressive growth plan,” said 
      P. Brendon Lundberg, president and CEO of Radiant Health Management 
      Corp. “We plan to open 100 Radiant Pain Relief Centres over the next 
      five years, and expect rapid growth in revenues and headcount. 
      Therefore, the need for fiscal accountability and leadership is 
      essential to achieve that goal and serve the maximum number of patients 
      possible. Chris has the experience to drive the company through that 
      process.”
    

      “Radiant’s business model and market opportunity are familiar to me on 
      many levels,” said Roberts. “It is exciting to be part of a great 
      company with a growing team that has the ability to profoundly impact so 
      many peoples’ lives, many of which have exhausted all other options.”
    

      Lundberg and Roberts anticipate that organic revenue growth will be 
      coupled with outside investment to achieve its growth targets.
    

      “We are in talks with a handful of investors and plan to expand upon 
      that in coming months. The key is when to fund expansion, and when to 
      employ strategic marketing initiatives,” said Roberts.

Radiant Basket
Consumer Healthcare platform


                                  The Radiant Basket platform drives significant additional sales, maximises margin in store and strips out significant time and cost for both the company and their pharmacy partners.
                                  Weâre now at the point where pharmacists will log into deals sent via email and fulfil orders without the need for the representative.
                                  This will enable the outbound telesales and territory sales teams to focus on added value services and relevant cross selling and upselling opportunities.

Optomeyes is the Radiant Health commercial platform that enables Optometrists to compete on price and convenience with online lens retailers.

                                  The Optomeyes website and Sparkle app is a platform designed to enable consumers to use their specific prescription to order contact lenses and other eye-care products via a personalised app delivered to their door at competitive prices.
                                  At the same time the platform enables optometrists to maintain and build their relationship with the patient while realising a commercial benefit from orders placed directly on the company via the app.
                                  This particular solution was designed to answer the single biggest problem posed to our partner by the Optometrists â loss of retails sales to overseas and domestic online suppliers.

Our Approach



At Radiant Pain Relief Centres, we know the challenges and disappointments of living daily with chronic pain. Most of our patients have dealt with chronic pain for years or even decades and have had limited success with other treatment options. What they discover at Radiant Pain Relief Centres is a non-invasive, non-drug-based therapy solution that is safe and effective. Our treatment team always puts patients’ needs first, resulting in a very high success rate.
With our exclusive FDA-cleared technology, Scrambler Therapy®, and patient-centered care model, we are able to produce exceptional pain relief outcomes. In most cases, pain relief is profound and lasting – typically 30-90 days of sustained pain reduction.
We look at every patient as an individual with unique needs and circumstances, and we strive to help them regain hope for a brighter tomorrow. We include the patient’s spouse, companion, family members or caregivers in the care experience, which we find aids in the positive experience and care outcomes.
Our approach to pain relief is unlike anything else available today. Combining state-of-the art technology in a refined, patient-centered care model, we are able to produce substantial lasting pain relief with a cost-effective, outcomes-based solution. Contact us today to learn more or to schedule a complimentary evaluation.

Understanding Chronic Pain
There are basically two-types of pain – chronic and acute. Acute pain serves a purpose, and is considered protective and productive. It alerts people suffering from a problem and reminds them to take it easy until it is healed. Chronic pain, on the other hand, no longer serves a productive or protective purpose and, in fact, may actually prevent the sufferer from functioning and healing as well as they could.  Chronic pain is a disease of its own in which pain grows in duration (beyond 3-6 months) and/or in intensity disproportionately to, or sometimes without, a clear underlying cause. When this happens, the brain has learned to accept, expect and generate the pain experience. An example of this is phantom pain, in which a person may feel explicit pain in a part of the body that is no longer there and should not be feeling anything, let alone pain. This same phenomenon happens in almost all types of chronic pain and is the reason that efforts to mask or dull the painful sensation are often unsuccessful. Trying to mask pain with a drug, an injection, physically manipulation, or even surgical intervention often does not produce lasting relief. While there may be some physical or mechanical factors which have or are contributing to pain, to get durable, lasting relief, the brain must be restored back to a more normal, healthy perception of pain.  
The Radiant Approach to Treating Chronic Pain 
Radiant Pain Relief Centres offer a unique and progressive treatment for chronic pain, which helps retrain the brain and restore it back to a more normal, healthy perception of pain.  We have treated hundreds of patients with nearly every type of chronic pain imaginable. On average, our patients experience an 84% reduction in pain, and more than 90% of our patients conclude therapy with a pain score of zero or near zero. 
By combining a highly refined care model with a novel FDA-cleared device known as Scrambler Therapy® we’re changing the way chronic pain is treated. Our patient-centered model uses this state of the art medical technology, which is non-invasive, non-drug based, safe and highly effective at significantly reducing, or completely eliminating, pain with lasting relief. This technology, along with a unique care and cost model, make our approach the most effective and appealing way to treat chronic pain. See our patient reviews.   
We are the only clinic in the world that performs treatment with Scrambler Therapy (previously called Calmare) exclusively.  Because of this, we’ve developed a level of expertise not found in most other clinics. We’ve also coupled this technology with a start-to-finish care model that ensures consistency, optimizes outcomes, and provides a patient experience unmatched anywhere. Our unique payment model, offered exclusively at Radiant, makes Scrambler Therapy®  affordable while simultaneously promoting the optimal access to treatment for even the most severe chronic pain. For these reasons, patients seek us out, traveling from out of state, or out of country, because they trust Radiant Pain Relief Centres with their care.  We offer a free evaluation and Scrambler Therapy® session, so patients can feel confident that this therapy can help them before they invest anything. Most patients tell us that this is the best investment they’ve ever made in the management of their chronic pain and perhaps in their healthcare all together.  
Contact us today to learn more or to schedule a complimentary evaluation and treatment session. 
What to Expect
Many of our patients have been dealing with chronic pain for many months, years or decades. They have tried a variety of solutions but have not found satisfactory pain relief. For many this has caused a sense of discouragement, which can be as frustrating and difficult as the pain itself. At Radiant Pain Relief Centres, individuals find a team of caring, compassionate staff that understands the difficulties of living in chronic pain. Through a highly refined, patient-centered care model that combines skillful patient communication and application of sophisticated FDA-cleared Scrambler Therapy®, patients can experience profound pain relief with lasting results.
Radiant Pain Relief Centres’ treatment does not use drugs, needles or surgery, but rather administers mild electrical impulses, which replicate normal, healthy nerve communications. These impulses communicate with and retrain how the brain perceives the chronic pain messages. The result is total or near total pain relief, which becomes lasting through the principles of neuroplasticity.
In most cases, significant pain relief is experienced in the first treatment session. Over a series of consecutive daily treatments for about 2-3 weeks, patients experience total or near total pain relief with results lasting for 30-90 days on average. Periodic booster treatments are administered when necessary to maintain optimal, ongoing relief.
Contact us today to learn more or to schedule a complimentary evaluation and treatment session. 
Is This Right For You?
If you’re dealing with chronic pain, and particularly if that pain is negatively affecting your daily life, we’d like to hear from you. Many of our patients have tried a variety of treatment options which have not adequately relieved their pain. On a daily basis we’re able to help relieve pain for patients who had previously felt there was no hope. Read about how Radiant’s therapy has changed the lives of so many patients. 
We offer a complimentary consultation, which typically includes a treatment session at no cost. We want everyone who is dealing with chronic pain to experience our care approach. Not everyone is a candidate and not every course of treatment is 100% successful, but we’d love the opportunity to talk to you and see if you can experience the profound lasting relief that so many of our patients continue to experience.

Radiant Health Management Corp Names Chris Roberts its First CFO

Ryan LeverenzWest Linn, Ore. – March 31, 2015 – Radiant Health Management Corp, which opened the first of 100 planned Radiant Pain Relief Centres in February 2014 in West Linn, named Chris Roberts chief financial officer, a newly formed role for the growing company. Mr. Roberts started his career at KPMG, and most recently served as a senior partner and controller at Vancouver, Wash.-based Audigy Group, where he was part of the executive management team that led growth from $600,000 in revenue in 2005 to approximately $32 million in 2014. During that time, the company established itself as one of the most influential companies in the hearing care industry, and has been ranked numerous times for its growth by various American City Business Journals, Inc. magazine, and others. The Portland Business Journal named Roberts small company CFO of the Year in 2009, and 40 under 40 in 2012.
“We believe that the demand for non-surgical, non-narcotic pain relief in North America, a $600 billion market, presents our business with both an opportunity and a responsibility for an aggressive growth plan,” said P. Brendon Lundberg, president and CEO of Radiant Health Management Corp. “We plan to open 100 Radiant Pain Relief Centres over the next five years, and expect rapid growth in revenues and headcount. Therefore, the need for fiscal accountability and leadership is essential to achieve that goal and serve the maximum number of patients possible. Chris has the experience to drive the company through that process.”
“Radiant’s business model and market opportunity are familiar to me on many levels.” said Roberts. “It is exciting to be part of a great company with a growing team that has the ability to profoundly impact so many peoples’ lives, many of which have exhausted all other options.”
Lundberg and Roberts anticipate that organic revenue growth will be coupled with outside investment to achieve its growth targets.
“We are in talks with a handful of investors and plan to expand upon that in coming months. The key is when to fund expansion, and when to employ strategic marketing initiatives,” said Roberts.
Radiant Pain Relief
Radiant’s groundbreaking pain treatment is a highly refined care model centered on a technology developed by Professor Giuseppe Marineo at the Medical Bioengineering Research Center in Rome, Italy. It was cleared by the FDA in 2009 under the term “scrambler therapy,” and uses a new theory of pain management that addresses the way the brain receives and interprets chronic pain information, rather that trying to suppress or dull the pain message. By using artificial intelligence that mimics the
body’s natural healthy pain signaling, the technology replaces the chronic pain message with a no pain message to the brain. Through neuroplasticity, the body learns and adopts this pain-free messaging. The result is significant or total pain relief for nearly all types chronic pain, lasting an average of 30-90 days.
In July 2014, Radiant Health Management Corp entered into an exclusive North American supply agreement with Professor Marineo. The technology was distributed by another U.S. corporation in North America from 2009 until March 2014. Under Radiant Health Management Corporation, Lundberg and his team intend to create more advanced protocols for training and administering the treatment, and place efficacy through Radiant Pain Relief Centres at the highest levels known to the therapy.
More than 100 million people in the U.S. suffer from chronic pain, according to American Academy of Pain Medicine, or nearly one in three people. Historical treatment approaches for chronic pain are limited, and often risky, costly or come with significant side effects. In fact, the most recent data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in September ranked Oregon number one in the U.S. for the non-medical use of opioids—an illegal and often risky and potentially lethal use of painkiller medications. The high rate of opioid use in Oregon is part of a nationwide trend over the last two decades. Radiant Pain Relief Centres are uniquely positioned to address the epidemic of chronic pain; without drugs, needles, or surgery.
To date, Radiant Pain Relief Centres have gathered the following patient data:
* Average Reduction in pain as a score, 6.2
* Average Reduction in pain as a percentage, 81%
* Percentage reduced to zero or one, 50%
* Average reduction in pain area (rule of 9s), 66%
* Average number of initial treatments, 10 sessions
* Average duration of relief, 30-90 days
* Average number of maintenance boosters, avg. 5 treatment per 6 patients
* Percentage of patient who pursue therapy, 84%
* Patient demographics, approx. 50% male and female

From Tears of Pain to Tears of Laughter: My life changing health prayer was answered
Rhona | St. Kitts, Eastern Caribbean
My name is Rhona and I am 44 year old woman who has suffered from over a year of chronic pain. My life and health was in a dark cloud of chronic pain due to an accident in which I suffered a severe torn ligament, unbearable plantar fasciitis, and throbbing chronic back and neck pain. Due to my injuries, I was on a medical leave of work absence, and I was unable to maintain my daily living chores such as walking to the kitchen, cooking, and sadly could not even put on a shoe due to my gate and misalignment of my body. As most people do, I searched for professional medical help with orthopedics, spine specialist, and podiatrist. Many which involved testing of MRI scans, bone scans, ultrasounds, x-rays to determine the cause of pain. The diagnostic conclusion was Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). Months went by with unsuccessful treatments such as nerve and anti inflammatory pain medications, physical therapy, activity restriction, and wearing an orthopedic boot.
My hope, belief and guidance of the lord, led me to seek medical attention from my country boundaries of St. Kitts in the Eastern Caribbean to Portland, Oregon. I was in search of such a healing treatment which did not involve any surgical procedures, medical implantations or devices and I did not want to continue living on pain medications. With a simple thought of thinking outside of medical box, I was able to find Radiant Pain Relief Centres by a simple google search. The treatment provided me the type of drug-free, natural, and affordable care (payment option plan) I was seeking in a short amount of my travel time. My search was over as this amazing facility offered me a treatment which allowed me to be hopeful, positive and most of all relief from the entire chronic, long -term stabbing shooting nerve pain I was experiencing. My pain level has gone from 8 (severe pain) to almost a complete 0 (no pain) within the recommended treatment course.
Many thanks and praise I give to the remarkable team at Radiant Pain Relief Centres. This unique medical facility and staff offer compassion, commitment and the best communication throughout the course of treatment from start to finish. The environment and energy is very warm, friendly, and loving. Each staff member has a strong passionate commitment to each and every patient’s medical and emotional needs using their kind words of honesty and truthfulness. The staff personally spends quality time with each patient to get them on a personal level and supports them during each treatment. The team members are not only present for guidance but also listen to needs and health concerns of each patient and family member. All members of this Radiant team are very professional, understanding and believe in healing those whom suffer from pain.
Because of Radiant Pain Relief Centres amazing team, I was able to achieve my quality of life and health back and continue to enjoy life smiling with no pain!
 
It truly is life changing. I feel like I got “me” back.

“The pain in my Right hip started about 22 years ago. Eventually I was diagnosed with Osteoarthritis. I was prescribed Norcor and even tried a Fentanyl Patch. Both made me sluggish and I was tired of feeling drugged up all the time. When the pain settled in my back and hands the medication was no longer an option. I heard about Radiant Pain Relief Centre’s Scrambler therapy from my doctor; he suggested that it might be something that could help relieve my pain. After waiting for 6 months, I finally came in and tried the treatment. I couldn’t believe I was out of pain with my very first treatment. Prior to the first treatment my fingers were claw-like, and I couldn’t grip anything and everything was painful. I was living through the pain. I still cooked and cleaned and maintained my life the best way I could. I used my hands daily for my work too. I restore, refurbish and repurpose glass, metals and wood pieces at an antique store. But I couldn’t live with this daily pain anymore. Today I am grateful for Scrambler Therapy and the staff at Radiant Pain Relief Centres. It truly is life changing. I feel like I got “me” back. I feel like it gets better and better over time. Every time I come in for a booster I feel better than I did the last time. It’s like a miracle. I can do the things I love again. Being a wife and a mother, working with my hands daily on projects and enjoying out door cycling and skiing again. It’s so life changing that I think everyone in chronic pain should come in and try it. Come in and meet the wonderful staff and try a complimentary treatment. See how it can change your life too!!
 
This is a Miracle
Laina R. | Portland, OR
10 years. That’s how long I have had severe and chronic abdominal pain. A complication from a day surgery resulted in a diagnoses of Pancreatitis. It should have gone away after several weeks but for some unknown reason, the pain never went away. It has been like I have had Pancreatitis for the past ten years. Abdominal pain has been with me everyday since then, until I found a story about Scrambler Therapy and how it can help with nerve pain issues. Within 30 minutes, on my first visit, Scrambler Therapy erased my abdominal pain! It was temporary and only last 20 minutes but it was 20 hopeful minutes and a start to a new life. I signed up for the recommended initial sessions and held my breath that Radiant Pain Centres could duplicate that miracle of being pain free. I am so happy to tell you I am a success story! My journey isn’t over but I continue to expand how many days I am pain free and, each time the pain returns, it is less and easily stopped with just one, or two, additional sessions. I am off most of my pain medications and continue to decrease the amount of medications I take. This is a miracle, this machine and the people at Radiant Pain Centres have given me a new lease on life. I can’t thank them enough.
 
Best thing I ever did!

Best thing I ever did! The first treatment that has truly helped in 3 years for my post mastectomy nerve pain. It’s amazing to have relief and the staff is wonderful.
 
It Has Been Very Effective
Rick S. | Eugene. OR
I experience a high level of pain and the only thing I’ve found that can totally knock out the pain for periods of time, is the treatments at Radiant Pain Relief. It was inconclusive at first, but once we found the right nerve, it has been very effective. I’ve tried drugs and even physical therapy, but nothing works as well. I live in Eugene so it’s a time commitment to travel, and a financial commitment…I wouldn’t be spending those kind of dollars and the travel time if there wasn’t enough relief.

Pam Savory | Portland, OR
When first coming to Radiant Pain Relief Centres, the pain from my Trigeminal Neuralgia interfered with daily life. I had to avoid any touch, any wind or cold, caution when brushing teeth and avoiding excessive noise. When walking into the clinic, I felt surrounded by competent and compassionate people that truly wanted me to live a better life. Their confidence in the science of the technology, gave me a ray of hope. Since treatment, I walk daily in the weather, can have gentle touch on my face and don’t even think about a noisy environment. My sleep has improved and I am free of all medications!
 
Life-changing treatment option
Kyle Valentine, DMD | Portland, OR
I experienced the onset of muscle and nerve pain in my neck and back, made worse by long hours working as a general dentist. Eventually, my condition became so severe that I could no longer practice clinical dentistry. It became extremely discouraging to spend a great deal of money and valuable time on treatments and doctor visits hoping to find something to alleviate the pain. As a last resort, several expensive surgical options were recommended with less than ideal success rates. Fortunately, before I committed to surgery, my family physician recommended a treatment offered at Radiant Pain Relief Centres. I was cautiously optimistic after years of failed treatment, but I was offered a FREE initial treatment to see if the type of pain I experienced could be treated with the Radiant Pain Relief Centres’ technology. I loved the opportunity to try the treatment before investing additional time and money. The process was actually relaxing and best of all; I experienced 100%, true pain relief before the end of my first free treatment. My experience with the Radiant’s treatment using Scrambler Therapy was unique in that I finally experienced successful, sustained pain relief, allowing me to return to my day-to-day responsibilities. This was a game changer for me. I was able to avoid risky and expensive surgery, narcotic painkillers and weeks of recovery from a costly surgical procedure without knowing the outcome. It was an easy decision after experiencing a successful free treatment and one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. My sincere praise for the life-changing treatment option is given with complete confidence. My only regret is that I didn’t have the opportunity to receive treatment five years ago, but then I may not have appreciated how incredible a simple, non-invasive treatment option could provide such profound success. It was definitely an experience unlike any other. The feeling of true 100% pain relief after years of chronic, debilitating pain is unlike anything I’ve experienced and given me my life back. A sincere thank you to the wonderful team at Radiant Pain Relief Centres.

Jami Bishop | Portland, OR
I am a 53 year old, mother and grandmother, and I have worked for over 30 years with severe back pain due to a fall through a trap cellar door when I was a child. In 2004 the pain was overwhelming and I saw many doctors for help. I tried physical therapy, chiropractors, injections, prolotherapy, a variety of pain medicines, and pain patches. I finally had my Sacroilliac joint and L5-S1 both fused in 2008. After the surgery the pain increased even worse and it became terribly painful to sit. Walking felt like there was a sledge hammer that was tapping my back with every step. There was a knifelike pain in my spine that never ceased. I could only make the pain bearable by lying down. Pain in my back and Sacroilliac joint made it impossible to sit, so I was essentially bedridden. Again I tried physical therapy, Pilates, injections, nerve ablation, Rhyzotomy, acupuncture, tens unit and I had a trial for the Spinal Cord Stimulator. The Spinal Cord Stimulator did not mask my pain, and the thought of another invasive procedure that could cause more nerve damage made that option too disagreeable. I was so desperate. I kept searching for something that could help with the pain. I saw several different pain doctors, and I heard more than once, that I needed to accept the pain, and that I would be disabled, and dependent on opiates for the rest of my life. I found out a little later, that I had a fractured vertebrae and Spondylolisthesis. I had another fusion surgery to have that corrected, and the pain after that was about the same, although even worse when sitting. Finally I heard about Radiant Pain Relief Centre’s exclusive therapy, and researched everything that I could on-line. I couldn’t wait to try the therapy and in July I went to West Linn, OR. I had 5 treatments, and the pain relief lasted. I was able to walk without hunching over and without limping. My pain level was almost zero when walking, but sitting was still extremely painful. This pain relief lasted 3 weeks, but still, I was able to walk and exercise for the first time in years. To try everything with zero results, and to finally try something that actually does reduce my pain has finally given me hope. The facts that it is non-invasive, and does not have any side effects is just amazing to me, because all the medications I take and have tried have terrible, terrible side effects. I truly believe that with more treatments, there will come a time I will be able to get off of opiate medication and get back to living my life.
 
Made my life more enjoyable.
Dennis Weehunt | Aurora, OR
I wanted to send you this testimonial on how good I am doing after having five treatments at your clinic. I am 65 years old and have worked as a millwright for most of my life. As a result of working with impact tools, large wrenches and other tools my thumb joints on both hands have caused me to be in a great deal of pain. Pain was so bad that it would wake me up at night. Picking up my grandchildren or twisting off a bottle cap would send me to a pain level of 8. I had been told by doctors that I needed surgery on both of my thumbs. The pain wasn’t so much in the joints as it was the surrounding area. My first exposure to the Radiant Pain Relief Centres was not as a patient. I had taken my Uncle there for treatment for long-term Shingles pain. My Uncle had been suffering with pain at a level between 8 and 10 for 3 years. After a few treatments his pain level had dropped to a 3-4 level. I had been asking a lot of questions about the treatment and one day the tech asked if I would like to be hooked up to the machine so I could better understand what my Uncle was feeling. At that time I had not told the tech how bad my thumbs were. My left thumb was giving me the most pain, so asked if she would hook it up to my left hand. As she started the treatment on my Uncle I was feeling what he felt. As the machine ramped up I noticed my thumb pain was going away. I started opening and closing my hand and then making a tight fist – my pain was gone. At the end of my Uncle’s treatment I told the tech how bad my hands were and what I felt during my Uncle’s treatment. She scheduled an appointment the next day for me. It’s been 6 + months now of being pain free on my right thumb. At 4 months I had to have a booster treatment on the left thumb. Depending on what I am doing the left thumb gets sore at a 1-3 level but after a day’s rest it’s fine. During the period of treatment on my thumbs I had a home accident where I lost 1 inch of a finger on my left hand. I was having a lot of ghost pain, swelling and stiffness. While having treatment on my thumb my finger pain was gone. I could almost close that finger into a fist. The bandage needed to be changed every day so I would wait until my appointment to change the dressing. I was able to accomplish this totally pain free. When I went back to the hand doctor, she was amazed at my flexibility healing and level of pain. I want to thank you all at Radiant Pain Relief Centres for making my life more enjoyable. And if you are wondering about my Uncle’s Shingles Pain, the Tech found that his was one of they worst cases they had treated. With three major hot spots on his chest and back, they were able to get his pain from a 8-9 to a 2-3 level.
