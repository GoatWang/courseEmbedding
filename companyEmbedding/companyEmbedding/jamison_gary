Job Details
               Farmer John offers several high-protein, carb-conscious products to meet a wide range of dietary needs. Whether you're looking for fulfillment on the daily food pyramid, a reliable go-to for The Paleo Diet™, or even low-carb choices with the Atkins Diet™, Farmer John has you covered. Our 100% natural CALIFORNIA NATURAL® Fresh Pork products like the FARMER JOHN® Pork Tenderloin and the FARMER JOHN® Extra Lean Ground Pork are good sources of protein as part of a well-balanced diet. You can also rely on Farmer John for lean protein; 7 cuts of our pork meet USDA guidelines for "lean" by containing fewer than 10 grams of fat, 4.5 grams of saturated fat and 95mg of cholesterol per 100 grams of meat. Offering more than 50 varieties of tasty meats, the ways Farmer John can support a well-balanced diet are numerous. We encourage you to incorporate Farmer John products into delicious dishes to create nutritious meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. By adding products like our fresh pork or sausages to a plate of veggies, you can benefit from a well-rounded meal. Get inventive and have fun cooking up endless nutritious food pairings. Visit our Recipes section for some inspiration and explore new approaches to cooking well-balanced meals. A lot of Farmer John products are naturally nutrient-rich. Pork happens to be low in sodium and high in potassium. For this reason, leaner cuts of pork such as our CALIFORNIA NATURAL® Fresh Pork Tenderloin are considered a heart-healthy option according to the American Heart Association®. Many cuts of our high-quality, fresh pork contain healthy nutrients, and a 3 oz. serving of pork is considered a good source of vitamins and minerals like vitamin B6, phosphorus, niacin, riboflavin, selenium zinc and potassium. For a clearer idea of just how nutritious pork can be, refer to our comparison chart below.
