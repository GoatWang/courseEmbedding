Welcome to the Neighborhood.
Confidently evaluate and compare different neighborhoods with our proprietary, data-driven Roofstock Neighborhood Rating.

The rental home is important, but so is location
Whether you live around the corner or across the country, understanding the characteristics of a neighborhood is crucial to determining investment appeal. That’s why Roofstock created the Roofstock Neighborhood Rating, a powerful algorithm that normalizes neighborhood data across markets and enables you to compare investment properties on an even footing. This dynamic system measures a dozen key attributes including school district quality, home values, employment rates, income levels and other vital investment criteria, empowering rental home investors to quickly and confidently make an informed purchase decision.
 
Use the Roofstock Neighborhood Rating to measure investment risk against potential return





5-star









4-star








3-star







2-star






1-star














Neighborhood Profile
This is the most affluent type of neighborhood on our rating scale, with higher-income residents and newer homes far above the median price. The school districts in this area are top-rated and highly desirable.
Risks & Rewards
Homes in upscale neighborhoods come at a steeper purchase price, resulting in higher entry costs upfront and lower initial yield. However, properties in 5-star neighborhoods can have lower operational risks and better renter stability.
Get 5 Star Properties 



 







Neighborhood Profile
These medium- to high-income neighborhoods aren’t as upscale as areas with 5 stars, but possess similar attributes. Homes here are generally of high quality and the surrounding school districts are very good.
Risks & Rewards
Buyers looking for quality homes in an area with more manageable entry costs than 5-star neighborhoods should consider 4-star neighborhoods. Yields are generally higher than in 5-star areas but lower than in 3-star neighborhoods, since rent is typically a lower percentage of the property value for these more expensive homes.
Get 4 Star Properties 



 







Neighborhood Profile
For buyers who prefer a little variety, 3-star neighborhoods tend to have more inventory than their 4- and 5-star counterparts. These areas typically have decent school districts, above average income levels, and boast a blend of newer and older homes.
Risks & Rewards
These listings often strike a good balance for buyers between risk and reward. It’s easier to find properties in 3-star neighborhoods at median price points with more attractive yields, which can compensate for the somewhat higher risk presented by tenants with lower incomes.
Get 3 Star Properties 



 







Neighborhood Profile
This is a lower-income neighborhood with an even mix of owner- and renter-occupied homes. Homes in 2-star neighborhoods are generally older, and local school district quality is below average.
Risks & Rewards
With lower purchase prices come more opportunity for positive cash flow, so buyers looking to see higher yields should explore 2-star neighborhoods. However, these neighborhoods tend to have older homes, and sometimes have greater variability of cash flow driven by renter instability.
Get 2 Star Properties 



 







Neighborhood Profile
This is a low-income area with older homes and a low average school rating. Compared to higher-ranking areas, 1-star neighborhoods have the greatest amount of renter-occupied properties, the lowest median income, and highest renter instability.
Risks & Rewards
At the lowest entry point for purchasers, properties in 1-star neighborhoods have the greatest risk as well as the greatest potential yield. In 1-star neighborhoods, investors seeking higher potential returns should be willing to take on even greater probability for renter instability, as well as volatility in asset values and cash flow.
Get 1 Star Properties 



 





None of the above should be considered investment advice. Your results may differ. Please consult your financial advisor prior to purchasing through the Roofstock Marketplace.

Innovation Built on Experience
The Single-Family Rental sector has stuck to the old way of doing things for far too long – it’s an industry ripe for disruption. Roofstock is leading the way.
Roofstock is the first online marketplace created exclusively for investing in leased Single-Family Rental homes that generate cash flow day one. Created by investors for investors, Roofstock provides research, analytics, and insights to evaluate and purchase independently certified properties.
Roofstock turns the old way of investing on its head, bringing transparency and efficiency to create a better way to transact. Buyers access vetted homes with current cash flow. Sellers market homes without lost income or disrupting tenants. Neighborhoods avoid signs in yards which could depress values. It’s win-win all around.
The most revolutionary aspect of the Roofstock marketplace is enabling investors to treat their real estate investments more like stock portfolios, focusing on asset allocation, rather than dealing with the hassles of researching and buying vacant homes that need to be repaired and leased. This creates significant time and cost savings for all parties.
The leadership team at Roofstock brings together some of the top players from the Single-Family Rental industry under one “roof” (pun intended), including a top principal investor, the CEO of one of the largest public Single-Family Rental companies, the leading investment banker in the space and one of the sector’s most active financiers. Add some of Silicon Valley’s top tech talent and investors, and you have Roofstock!





Our Leadership Team


                                Gary Beasley                                CEO & Co-Founder


Close
Gary Beasley, CEO & Co-Founder
Gary has spent most of his career building businesses in the real estate, hospitality and tech sectors. After earning his BA in economics from Northwestern, Gary ventured west to earn his MBA from Stanford, where he caught the entrepreneurial bug and still serves as a regular guest lecturer. Previously Gary was instrumental in acquiring and integrating more than $800 million of resort properties for KSL Resorts, and spent five years as CFO of online brokerage pioneer ZipRealty, which he led through its successful IPO in 2004. Gary also served as CEO of Joie de Vivre Hospitality, then the second largest boutique hotel management company in the country.  Immediately before starting Roofstock, Gary led one of the largest single-family rental platforms in the U.S. through its IPO as co-CEO of Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust, now part of Colony Starwood Homes. In addition to striving to build great companies, he enjoys skiing with his family, running with his golden retriever (and office mascot) Bode, and trying not to break any bones while mountain biking.

Gregor Watson, Chairman & Co-Founder
Gregor is a serial real estate and technology entrepreneur who has founded multiple enterprises. He is a founding member of 1 Sharpe Capital and is the Chairman of 643 Capital Management, which is a co-owner of Streetlane Homes—a top 10 owner of single-family rental homes in the US. In addition to serving as a board member at Streetlane, Gregor currently ​serves as​ chairman of Roofstock, ​overseeing the platform’s development and strategy as well as the ​the company's expansion efforts in domestic and international markets. Prior to co-founding Roofstock, ​Gregor​ built and sold Dwell Finance, the largest national bridge lender at the time.

Close
Rich Ford, Chief Development Officer & Co-Founder
A recovering investment banker, Rich deserves the Single-Family Rental Lifetime Achievement Award... for being one of the first to embrace the Single-Family Rental sector as an institutional asset class during his time at Jefferies. Having previously spent time at Lehman and Bank of America, Rich is embracing startup life and only wonders why he waited this long to dive in! Being Canadian, of course Rich put himself through college rappelling out of helicopters to fight forest fires. Don’t they all?




                                Devin Wade                                VP Strategic Initiatives & Co-Founder


Close
Devin Wade, VP Strategic Initiatives & Co-Founder
Devin has been leading the strategic efforts at Roofstock from the time our company was a mere idea, and brings a wealth of startup experience and passion for what we are building. He also has more interesting hats and pairs of sneakers than the entire rest of the team combined! 




                                Jason Altieri                                Chief Legal & Compliance Officer


Close
Jason Altieri, Chief Legal & Compliance Officer
Jason brings extensive legal expertise in the fintech sector to Roofstock, having previously served as General Counsel at Lending Club, which he helped take public in 2014. His work at Lending Club earned him the title of Best Corporate Counsel, Private Companies by the Silicon Valley Business Journal and San Francisco Business Times in 2014. When he’s not jumping into crazy new business models and driving explosive growth, he loves to spend time hiking and snowshoeing in the Lakes Basin region.

Close
Mark Halstead, Chief Technology Officer
Mark has been CTO of numerous start-ups and prides himself with being platform agnostic, as evidenced by his stints at firms as diverse as Apple, Microsoft, Ingenio and Coveroo. Mark is legendary for his “Good Will Hunting” moment when he solved a complex problem on the white board during his interview process that our guys were trying to figure out.

The Marketplace Fee is half of one percent of the sales price of the house. Upon payment of the fee, the property is marked as “sale pending” on the marketplace. The Marketplace Fee is not refundable. It is free to make an offer; the Marketplace fee is only applied if your offer is accepted. 
The Purchase and Sale Agreement is the official legal contract between the buyer and the seller and constitutes the opening of the escrow process. All terms for the purchase and sale of the property are outlined in the contract. The specific items in this contract vary by state. 
Earnest Money is a deposit that is made by the buyer as a display of good faith in the transaction. It is held by the Title company, and the funds will be used as part of the buyer’s down payment or closing costs when the transaction is finalized. EMD is either refundable to the buyer or retainable by the seller under the terms outlined in the PSA and refunds are administered by the Title Company. If the EMD is not received within 3 days of signing the PSA, the property will be returned to the marketplace.
