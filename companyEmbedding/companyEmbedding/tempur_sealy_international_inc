Ultra-luxury at a fraction of the price

Loom & Leaf is the luxury memory foam mattress by Saatva,
the company FORBES named to its top 100 companies to watch.

Objectively measured, Loom & Leaf  is best compared to iComfort and Tempur-Pedic®, 
but our efficient online business model allows us to charge significantly less. Many e-commerce 
sites offer memory foam beds that get rolled in a box and dropped on your doorstep. While our 
L&L mattress is priced slightly higher than these products, our quality is simply superior. Our delivery 
teams deliver and set up your mattress in the room of your choice, anywhere 
in the contiguous United States and parts of Canada.

Loom & Leaf is the smart, luxurious answer.





The perfect memory foam mattress







Our dense, 5 lb eco-friendly foam coupled with our multi-layered foam construction should never be crammed into a box. The L&L bed is delivered complete and set up in your home, with nationwide delivery.
        

Our breathable, organic cotton covering and natural thistle flame retardant keep you comfortable, cool and safe.
        

We use cooling gel to ensure you don’t overheat. Make every evening cool and comfortable. 
        

Loom & Leaf mattresses work with traditional and adjustable bases, allowing them to provide the perfect amount of comfort and support at every angle. 
        

Our American-made mattresses are 1/2 the price of a Tempur-Pedic®*,  making L&L the intelligent choice in premium memory foam. Our business model eliminates all brick and mortar mark-ups.

"For those who still pledge allegiance to the buoyant inner-spring mattress, two companies posses a variety of lavishly appointed options. Saatva’s three models all have inner-spring bases, memory-foam cushioning, and a plush pillow top. In keeping with its green initiative, it uses fire-safe thistle, organic cotton casings, recycled steel, and eco-friendly foam. A concierge service helps take your online experience off the screen, calling to offer a personal thank you in what cofounder Ricky Joshi refers to as “white glove” service. And because Joshi maintains that “certain technologies you can’t fold into a box,” Saatva mattresses are delivered and set up in your home by a dedicated team. Saatva’s sister company, Loom & Leaf, applies the same philosophy to memory-foam mattresses, which are also delivered unfolded to preserve their high-grade cooling gel layer."

About our frames

The bed frame fits all sizes of bedding. The center rail has 3 heavy duty legs for maximum center support from head to toe. The center support can be used on all sizes for maximum stability and support. 

The frame has a total of 7 heavy duty legs with floor guides. The frame sits 7.5" off the ground.



Our mattress removal service

The fee of $39.00 includes the removal of up to two items from your home (mattress and foundation, two mattresses or two foundations).

If you have more than two items the charge is $19.50 per item starting with the third item. Please add your additional item to you order  here  or contact us directly at 1-877-762-2882.





About our foundations



8.75" Foundation



4.75" Foundation


Like those found in most of today's premium interactive mattress sets, we offer a rigid solid support foundation that utilizes a solid deck support with a wood slat construction for maximum mattress and body support. Additionally, the foundation contains our eco-friendly foams and is covered in organic cotton.
Our foundation is available in two thickness options — a standard 8.75" foundation and a 4.75" low-profile foundation. Both are available in twin, full, queen, king, and California king sizes. There is absolutely no difference in the feel between the low-profile 4.75" and the standard 8.75".
All king and Cal king size foundations come split for delivery purposes, as they do not bend. The split foundation will fit into any entranceway or doorway. Twin, full, and queen all come standard in one piece.
Please note that we do have a split queen foundation available for an additional $35.00. This should be ordered if you feel a standard queen one-piece foundation won't fit into your entranceway or doorway. That option is not available in full or twin.




We guarantee that your mattress is crafted fresh, to our strict specifications. All mattresses are thoroughly inspected before being sent out for delivery to your home.


The Lineal™ Adjustable Base by Saatva
Moves with your day, enhancing where comfort lives – at home, in bed.

We make getting sleepy easy

All Loom & Leaf memory foam beds sleep cool, making for a very comfortable night's sleep. Choose from two comfort levels depending on your sleep preferences.
  




L&L Relaxed Firm
This is our flagship comfort level — not too hard, not too soft,  "just right" support.


L&L Firm
For customers who wanta very firm feel.


We do not recommend memory foam in this range because it becomes too "mushy," resulting in an unhealthy lack of support. 
  

    This range is too hard to support healthy sleep and joint comfort.

No regrets!!
I was originally skeptical about making a mattress purchase online, however, after my experiences with Saatva…I am very happy that I took the chance.  I purchased my Saatva mattress in November 2014 and felt it necessary to wait until now before posting a review.  I chose to write this simply because I relied on others reviews to help me make my decision to purchase, and I hope it helps you if you are on the fence about making the plunge…so here you go.

I have had my mattress for a little over 60 days and I am in love.  The purchase was very simple and easy to complete online with no hidden fees throughout the process.  A few days after making my purchase I was sent an email containing details of my purchase and what to expect for delivery.

About 14 days after my purchase I received a phone call from the delivery company to set up a date and a time window for delivery.  The delivery company arrived when expected and was very professional.  The mattress and foundation were taken to an upstairs master bedroom and installed on my bed frame after they removed the old mattress and foundation.  I was worried about off gassing and chemical odors that are common with new mattresses and was quite surprised when this was not the case.

A few days after delivery, I did have a question about the foundation and subsequently sent Saatva an email.  Within 5 minutes of sending my email I received a phone call from Saatva with an answer to my question.  I have NEVER had a company respond so fast to an email and to do so with a phone call….simply amazing.  The Saatva representative was very responsive and nice, and she quickly answered my questions offering her direct number if anything comes up and I should have more questions.  I give Saatva’s customer service an A+.  This is reassuring to me that they stand behind their product and are willing to go above and beyond to make their customers feel like they made the right decision.    

So now about the mattress itself.  I purchased a king sized luxury firm and I gotta say that I have never had a better night’s sleep than I have had with my Saatva mattress.  I wake up feeling refreshed with absolutely no back pain.  Another thing I have noticed is that I dream more often which I believe means a more relaxing and deeper sleep.  

I feel comfortable recommending this mattress to anyone who is looking at replacing theirs.  Based on the quality of this mattress I am sure that it will last as long as Saatva claims, and even if there are problems, I am sure that Saatva’s awesome customer service will take great care of me.  If you are reading this wondering if you should take the chance on Saatva….do it….I did and have absolutely no regrets.

Drew Peretzky
If you're reading this review you've probably been in the mattress market for a while. 

I spent hours online researching mattresses and came to realize what a racket this can be. It's impossible to compare products and all of them seem to have unhappy customers that have to jump through hoops to get any warranty satisfaction. I suddenly noticed how many mattress stores there are! Not something that you notice until you're looking for one. Obviously there is a huge mark-up on a mattress or there wouldn't be so many vendors in the marketplace. We actually went to a store - the "Numbers" mattress store, where you essentially inflate a bag to get the firmness you want - for big dollars. Fortunately my wife and I are the same "number" so we didn't really need the individual adjustability, but we would never have gone for it anyway - the quality just wasn't there and the price was silly - even if you didn't add the hundreds of dollars worth of pillows, and accessory "options".

Somehow I stumbled on the Saatva site and read with some astonishment the endless 5 star reviews. When I looked at the construction I was impressed with the quality features - no gimmicks. The warranty is superior to any others and they actually honor it. I could never imagine ordering such an important purchase over the internet - but I figured with the return policy I really couldn't lose.

We received our luxury firm mattress in early December and it has been wonderful. I actually look forward to falling into bed every night. The mattress itself was beautifully made of high quality materials, The delivery process was totally smooth and professional. Two months later we couldn't be happier with the quality and comfort, and the price is a bargain in my opinion.

I have only the highest praise for the product, the service, and the value for money. 

BTW this review is completely voluntary - I have not been solicited, paid or in any way induced by Saatva. 

We all need to support and encourage the growth of USA made products -especially when they are of exemplary quality.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Best Mattress Ever
I have been looking for the last couple of years for a mattress. I was very nervous about making a decision because you really can't tell if you are going to like something by laying on it for 3 minutes in a store. And, very nervous about buying a mattress online, sight unseen.
While on Facebook, I saw the advertisement for Saatva. I started looking into it and reading the reviews. 
I liked the fact that it had coil on coil construction and not just memory foam.  I took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered the Luxury Firm, King Size with the 8" box frames.
This was the best decision ever. I received it sooner than expected and we love it.  No more aches and pains when we get up in the morning. 
According to a tracking device I recently received, I was getting an average of 3 - 4 hours of sleep every night. Now with the new Saatva, I am getting 6 - 7 hours of sleep per night.  
I would recommend anyone who has any doubt to just try it out. I promise you'll love it.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Everything They Said it Would Be
I waited until now to write a review, now that I've had my mattress for a week.

First of all, placing the order was a breeze.  I decided to call and place my order rather than place it on line.  All my questions were answered and confirmation came right away, as well as a phone call, thanking me for the order.

The delivery date came and we eagerly awaited delivery.  Our delivery window was between 4:30pm and 6:30 pm.  When 6:30 came and went, with no call from the carrier, I contacted them.  Unfortunately they were closed.  Not knowing what to do, I contacted Saatva.  They went into action, managed to get someone from the carrier, and learned that it had been damaged in transit.  Cory, with Saatva, kept in contact with my and called at least 4 times, giving me updates.  Thanks, Cory, for giving up your Saturday evening to help a customer!

Saatva apologized profusely and, being customer focused, compensated me for the delay.  They got right on it and we received our mattress a week ago, Saturday.

Now the best part!  The mattress is unbelievably comfortable!!  I too, was a little leery ordering sight unseen but don't worry.  The product is terrific!  I love it!

The folks at Saatva get it.  They know that the customer puts the money into the equation and their focus on making the customer happy is their primary concern, both in service and quality.  

Buy a Saatva.  You'll sleep better at night!  :)Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Thank you Saatva!
I received your mattess almost 2 weeks ago. I had been "nervous" about ordering a mattress from an online store, but I did alot of research before finally choosing a Satvaa mattress. I was replacing a mattress from a well-known company. It was a torture chamber from day 1 as I felt like I was sleeping on the side of a mountain about to fall in to an abyss. Within 2 years a piece of the frame (plastic) broke and I had to take the whole thing apart to fix the frame. I was still sleeping on the side of a mountain....then the sides started to bulge out and the mattress would slide all over the base and the base would slide all over the floor. There was no helpful customer support, the mattress and base were made of shoddy materials, the whole thing started to fall apart within 5 years and was wildly overpriced. One of the air chambers finally popped and I was glad it did so I could get a traditional mattress and box spring, The day my Saatva mattress was to be delivered I took apart the old mattress and frame to toss it, and when I unzipped the cover and lifted up the foam beneath it I found black mold under the foam and top of the air chambers. I would have been delighted to sleep in a doggie bed at that point. Then the saatva arrived right on time and was delivered by polite and nice delivery men. When they left, I couldn't wait to put on sheets and try it out!  I could not believe how comfortable the bed was! For the first time in years I could sleep on my stomach and sides without pain, numbness and tingling! I forgot to mention that I am loaded with atthritis and within the last 9 years have had to have 2 back surgeries, 2 knee replacements and a right hip replacement. Bottom line...I sleep like a baby on this mattress and I am so happy I decided to take a "leap of faith" and trust the company and their incredible customer service and return policy. Thanks Saatva!Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Awesome! Back Pain Relieved
We got our matress a few days ago.  My wife has been suffering from lumbar back issues for over a year.  We have  tried IComfort, Stearns and Foster, and Beauty Rest matresses.  We even slept on an inflatable Coleman Matress with a futon pad.  Nothing worked.  The Saatva Luxery Firm matress has made a remarkable difference in my wife's back pain.  I sleep like a rock on it too!  Wonderful company, speedy delivery, and great price.  Have already recommended it to multiple friends.  Thanks for producing a quality product, in America for a great price point.  Thanks for the peace you have given to us.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Sleep Like the Dead
Having slept fairly comfortably on mid-priced/mid-quality mattresses (purchased from Sam's Club) for the past 20 years, my wife and I decided to finally take the plunge on a higher quality luxury mattress.  Like so many other reviewers on this website, we visited several local luxury mattress stores and were not pleased with either the construction quality or the sales experience.  So, we decided to check on-line to see what was available.  And in all the research, Saatva kept coming up over and over again as one the highest rated mattress manufacturers in terms of comfort, customer service and manufacturing quality.  After an afternoon of internet research, we took the plunge and ordered the 14.5 inch Luxury Firm king-sized mattress.

As someone who has led an active athletic life-style, I have had 5 knee surgeries, serious spinal/neck injuries, and most recently I was recovering from shoulder surgery.  Following the recovery from the shoulder surgery, I was unable to return to our old tired bed because it was so uncomfortable.  I was so excited the day our Saatva mattress arrived.  My wife and I couldn't wait to get the sheets on it and try it out.

The next few night's sleep (and every night since then) have been a revelation.  No longer do I toss and turn all night with all my various damaged and surgically repaired joints screaming at me.  Sleeping on our new Saatva mattress is like sleeping on a cloud.  You close your eyes and it feels like you are floating. The moment you stretch out, all the pressure points on all the old aching joints and injuries just disappear.  My wife and I both sleep so well on this mattress, we don't even set an alarm any more.  Lay down to sleep and then wake up 7 or 8 hours later more rested than you could ever imagine.  It made me realize how badly I had actually been sleeping on our old tired mattress.

The quality of this mattress and the entire buying experience couldn't have been any better.  The Saatva mattress has literally changed my life.  I have run out of superlatives so I will wrap it up by saying "Thanks Saatva!"

7-Month Review
I am a very conscientious on-line shopper. I did a pretty thorough job on researching mattresses along with comparison pricing. It is a very, very challenging exercise and I was very reluctant almost giving up in actually buying a mattress. That's how tough it is. I made the choice to go with SAATVA and after 7-months the mattress is in the same condition it was when it first got delivered. I purchased the 14” and cannot express how much we look forward to going to bed at night as a reward for the day’s work!Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Saatva's Special Edition Foundation

Like those found in most of today's premium interactive mattress sets, the Saatva mattress uses a rigid solid support foundation that utilizes a solid deck support with a wood slat construction for maximum mattress and body support. Additionally, they contain our eco-friendly foams and are covered in organic cotton.
Our foundations are available in two thickness options  a standard 8.75" foundation and a 4.75" low profile foundation. Both are available in twin, full, queen, king and California king sizes. There is absolutely no difference in the feel between the low profile 4.75" and the standard 8.75".


All king and Cal king size foundations come split for delivery purposes, as they do not bend. The split foundation will fit into any entrance way or doorway. Twin, full and queen all come standard in one piece.
Please note, we do have a split queen foundation available for an additional $35.00. This should be ordered if you feel a standard queen one piece foundation won't fit into your entrance way or doorway. That option is not available in full or twin.

* Simmons Beautyrest Black Hybrid Gladney 14" Luxury Firm Mattress at Mattress Firm
Choose comfort level 














Saatva mattresses are built with a distinctive high quality feature known as 'coil on coil' construction. Our lower coil unit offers a connected hourglass shaped steel support base. Our top coil unit features a luxurious individually wrapped coil system that contours and responds perfectly to your body, eliminating most motion transfer. Each individually wrapped coil is separate to ensure that the rest of the bed will not be disturbed by the movement of surrounding coils. This construction coupled with our advanced euro pillow top, can only be found in ultra premium mattresses that cost over $2,000 for a queen mattress. Our beds, which work with adjustable bases, are made to last 10 to 15 years and will continue to perform consistently well over time.  Note: All Saatva coil units are tempered three times and oven baked.SEE COMFORT LEVELS


We have uniquely combined the top 5 features found in ultra premium bedding and handcrafted them into one perfect and affordable luxury mattress.
Our standard premier luxury mattress is 14.5". We also make a custom slim 11.5" that was redesigned in March 2017 to work with adjustable bases, including the Lineal™ Adjustable Base by Saatva. The quality and feel of the mattresses are the same.







1
Individually Wrapped Comfort Coils

Individually wrapped coils in the top portion of the mattress are the most advanced coil system in the luxury mattress market. These coils respond and contour to every body shape.

  


2
Dual Perimeter Edge Support System


Foam encased anti-sag edge support for better durability and more sleep surface. The Saatva Mattress uses a Dual Perimeter Edge Support System. The upper comfort coils are foam encased.  This is a quality that only the most durable and best mattresses have.

  


3
Lumbar Support Enhancement


Lumbar support enhancement made of high quality memory foam layer, providing additional pressure relief while helping reduce stress and tension from the lower back.

  


4
Steel Coil Base Support System


All Saatva’s luxury mattresses are built with a tempered steel support lower coil base. This creates a long lasting, sustainable mattress with increased durability and is the best design to prevent sagging. 

  


5
Organic Cotton Cover & Euro Pillow Top


The euro pillow top offers more padding and cushioning materials than what is found in most regular pillow tops. These materials are then inserted underneath the outer covering for a neater and cleaner look. Regular pillow tops that are sewn to the top of a bed tend to shift and lose shape.

First, we made the world’s most luxurious all-natural latex mattress.Then we made it affordable.



            You can pay $4,000 USD or more for a top-of-the-line latex mattress at a retail store, but it won’t match Zenhaven.
        
            Handcrafted in America of 100% natural American Talalay latex, layered with breathable 100% organic New Zealand wool and wrapped in lush organic cotton, Zenhaven takes you to new heights of comfort and health.
        
            And because it’s from Saatva, the company that’s made luxury sleep affordable, and the largest seller of American Made 100% Talalay Latex Mattresses in the United States & Canada, Zenhaven can be yours for as little as $1,899 (for Queen).
        

Pure Eco-Sleep Crafted of 100% natural latex and organic fabrics, Zenhaven offers the most comfortable sleep of your life — and the greenest.
Superior ConstructionWe use premium American Talalay latex — and American craftsmanship — to create a mattress that’s as long lasting as it is luxurious.
Healthy By NatureZenhaven’s natural latex not only provides incomparable support, it’s hypoallergenic, resistant to mold and dust mites, and free of toxins of any kind.
Saatva’s Zenhaven mattress saves you up to 70%.


 
Zenhaven is brought to you by Saatva,the web’s best-reviewed mattress company —with more than 12,000 5-star reviews.


            That may explain how we became the 7th-fastest-growing private retail company in America, according to Inc. 500.

Shop Ashley HomeStore for a Wide Selection of Beds 

 
Cozy comfort of a perfect bed is only clicks away. Ashley HomeStore has a breadth of beds in different styles and sizes. From the beauty of a sleigh bed to the craftsmanship of a poster bed or platform bed, there is a wide range of beds to choose from. A king size bed is ideal for an extra wide room, while a queen size bed fits nicely in a room that’s a bit smaller. A queen bed can also be used in a guest room. Some of the most popular beds are canopy beds with traditional flair. For the convenience of having extra storage, beds with storage are ideal because they feature lower bottom drawers. Paired with form and function, a platform bed with storage often features drawers on each side of the bed—a smart feature to have for a guest bed. When looking for ultimate comfort, consider an upholstered bed. From the headboard to the footboard these beds are covered in rich fabrics, leather or affordable faux leather that exude a cozy feel. A tufted headboard, sometimes decorated with nailhead trim, bridges comfort with fashion. With our large selection of beds, you’ll find a perfect match.

Shop Ashley HomeStore for a Wide Selection of Foundations and Box Springs
 When shopping for a mattress, don’t forget the foundation or box spring. Well-built mattress foundations provide extra support and hold mattresses in place with their non-skid tops—essential for a supportive sleep. Boxspring sizes range from twin and full to king and California king. A split queen box spring or foundation consists of two foundations that support the mattress—two foundations are also used for king size beds. When it comes to height, a box spring mattress either has a low or standard profile. A low mattress box spring is perfect for those who do not like to sleep too high off the ground. The shorter height compensates for a thicker mattress height. Mattress foundations should have solid wood construction with diagonal bar, corner supports and impact–protected plastic edges. Go the extra mile for comfort and treat yourself to a power base. This holds an adjustable mattress, perfect for personalizing your sleep position. Find a wide selection of power bases in-store.

 IT Priorities
•Tempur Sealy is currently working to consolidate the company's systems in Microsoft Dynamics from other ERP platforms.

IT Structure •The primary focus of the IT department at Tempur Sealy International is to support the company's manufacturing, distribution, supply-chain, and mattress design.
•The company uses Oracle applications for its ERP system, including the databases, accounting and financial systems. However, the company is currently transitioning away from Oracle to Microsoft Dynamics for its ERP solutions.

The IT budget is typically finalized in Q4.

IT Intelligence Snippets
2012:
•Tempur-Pedic and Sealy Corporation recently merged to form Tempur Sealy International.
•Migrated its email to Microsoft Office from Lotus Notes
•Implemented new VoIP solution in its North Carolina office.

2012:
•Expecting IT storage spending to increase in the areas of data protection and recovery software, storage replication software, archiving software storage related cloud initiatives, and BigData initiatives. 
•Tempur Sealy International, Inc. describes Oracle as its biggest storage headache. Its top storage pain points are WAN being too slow, WAN optimization being too expensive, and the lack of modernizing/virtualizing solutions for systems and tape that are no longer viable.

•It uses Veritas NetBackup with one master and media server as its main backup application. Its daily and weekly total data backup is 4TBTB and 8TB respectively, with a 5-6 hour backup window. Its backup growth is around 500GB.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Ultra-luxury at a fraction of the price

Loom & Leaf is the luxury memory foam mattress by Saatva,
the company FORBES named to its top 100 companies to watch.

Objectively measured, Loom & Leaf  is best compared to iComfort and Tempur-Pedic®, 
but our efficient online business model allows us to charge significantly less. Many e-commerce 
sites offer memory foam beds that get rolled in a box and dropped on your doorstep. While our 
L&L mattress is priced slightly higher than these products, our quality is simply superior. Our delivery 
teams deliver and set up your mattress in the room of your choice, anywhere 
in the contiguous United States and parts of Canada.

Loom & Leaf is the smart, luxurious answer.





The perfect memory foam mattress







Our dense, 5 lb eco-friendly foam coupled with our multi-layered foam construction should never be crammed into a box. The L&L bed is delivered complete and set up in your home, with nationwide delivery.
        

Our breathable, organic cotton covering and natural thistle flame retardant keep you comfortable, cool and safe.
        

We use cooling gel to ensure you don’t overheat. Make every evening cool and comfortable. 
        

Loom & Leaf mattresses work with traditional and adjustable bases, allowing them to provide the perfect amount of comfort and support at every angle. 
        

Our American-made mattresses are 1/2 the price of a Tempur-Pedic®*,  making L&L the intelligent choice in premium memory foam. Our business model eliminates all brick and mortar mark-ups.

"For those who still pledge allegiance to the buoyant inner-spring mattress, two companies posses a variety of lavishly appointed options. Saatva’s three models all have inner-spring bases, memory-foam cushioning, and a plush pillow top. In keeping with its green initiative, it uses fire-safe thistle, organic cotton casings, recycled steel, and eco-friendly foam. A concierge service helps take your online experience off the screen, calling to offer a personal thank you in what cofounder Ricky Joshi refers to as “white glove” service. And because Joshi maintains that “certain technologies you can’t fold into a box,” Saatva mattresses are delivered and set up in your home by a dedicated team. Saatva’s sister company, Loom & Leaf, applies the same philosophy to memory-foam mattresses, which are also delivered unfolded to preserve their high-grade cooling gel layer."

About our frames

The bed frame fits all sizes of bedding. The center rail has 3 heavy duty legs for maximum center support from head to toe. The center support can be used on all sizes for maximum stability and support. 

The frame has a total of 7 heavy duty legs with floor guides. The frame sits 7.5" off the ground.



Our mattress removal service

The fee of $39.00 includes the removal of up to two items from your home (mattress and foundation, two mattresses or two foundations).

If you have more than two items the charge is $19.50 per item starting with the third item. Please add your additional item to you order  here  or contact us directly at 1-877-762-2882.





About our foundations



8.75" Foundation



4.75" Foundation


Like those found in most of today's premium interactive mattress sets, we offer a rigid solid support foundation that utilizes a solid deck support with a wood slat construction for maximum mattress and body support. Additionally, the foundation contains our eco-friendly foams and is covered in organic cotton.
Our foundation is available in two thickness options — a standard 8.75" foundation and a 4.75" low-profile foundation. Both are available in twin, full, queen, king, and California king sizes. There is absolutely no difference in the feel between the low-profile 4.75" and the standard 8.75".
All king and Cal king size foundations come split for delivery purposes, as they do not bend. The split foundation will fit into any entranceway or doorway. Twin, full, and queen all come standard in one piece.
Please note that we do have a split queen foundation available for an additional $35.00. This should be ordered if you feel a standard queen one-piece foundation won't fit into your entranceway or doorway. That option is not available in full or twin.




We guarantee that your mattress is crafted fresh, to our strict specifications. All mattresses are thoroughly inspected before being sent out for delivery to your home.


The Lineal™ Adjustable Base by Saatva
Moves with your day, enhancing where comfort lives – at home, in bed.

We make getting sleepy easy

All Loom & Leaf memory foam beds sleep cool, making for a very comfortable night's sleep. Choose from two comfort levels depending on your sleep preferences.
  




L&L Relaxed Firm
This is our flagship comfort level — not too hard, not too soft,  "just right" support.


L&L Firm
For customers who wanta very firm feel.


We do not recommend memory foam in this range because it becomes too "mushy," resulting in an unhealthy lack of support. 
  

    This range is too hard to support healthy sleep and joint comfort.

"For those who still pledge allegiance to the buoyant inner-spring mattress, two companies posses a variety of lavishly appointed options. Saatva’s three models all have inner-spring bases, memory-foam cushioning, and a plush pillow top. In keeping with its green initiative, it uses fire-safe thistle, organic cotton casings, recycled steel, and eco-friendly foam. A concierge service helps take your online experience off the screen, calling to offer a personal thank you in what cofounder Ricky Joshi refers to as “white glove” service. And because Joshi maintains that “certain technologies you can’t fold into a box,” Saatva mattresses are delivered and set up in your home by a dedicated team. Saatva’s sister company, Loom & Leaf, applies the same philosophy to memory-foam mattresses, which are also delivered unfolded to preserve their high-grade cooling gel layer."

No regrets!!
I was originally skeptical about making a mattress purchase online, however, after my experiences with Saatva…I am very happy that I took the chance.  I purchased my Saatva mattress in November 2014 and felt it necessary to wait until now before posting a review.  I chose to write this simply because I relied on others reviews to help me make my decision to purchase, and I hope it helps you if you are on the fence about making the plunge…so here you go.

I have had my mattress for a little over 60 days and I am in love.  The purchase was very simple and easy to complete online with no hidden fees throughout the process.  A few days after making my purchase I was sent an email containing details of my purchase and what to expect for delivery.

About 14 days after my purchase I received a phone call from the delivery company to set up a date and a time window for delivery.  The delivery company arrived when expected and was very professional.  The mattress and foundation were taken to an upstairs master bedroom and installed on my bed frame after they removed the old mattress and foundation.  I was worried about off gassing and chemical odors that are common with new mattresses and was quite surprised when this was not the case.

A few days after delivery, I did have a question about the foundation and subsequently sent Saatva an email.  Within 5 minutes of sending my email I received a phone call from Saatva with an answer to my question.  I have NEVER had a company respond so fast to an email and to do so with a phone call….simply amazing.  The Saatva representative was very responsive and nice, and she quickly answered my questions offering her direct number if anything comes up and I should have more questions.  I give Saatva’s customer service an A+.  This is reassuring to me that they stand behind their product and are willing to go above and beyond to make their customers feel like they made the right decision.    

So now about the mattress itself.  I purchased a king sized luxury firm and I gotta say that I have never had a better night’s sleep than I have had with my Saatva mattress.  I wake up feeling refreshed with absolutely no back pain.  Another thing I have noticed is that I dream more often which I believe means a more relaxing and deeper sleep.  

I feel comfortable recommending this mattress to anyone who is looking at replacing theirs.  Based on the quality of this mattress I am sure that it will last as long as Saatva claims, and even if there are problems, I am sure that Saatva’s awesome customer service will take great care of me.  If you are reading this wondering if you should take the chance on Saatva….do it….I did and have absolutely no regrets.

Drew Peretzky
If you're reading this review you've probably been in the mattress market for a while. 

I spent hours online researching mattresses and came to realize what a racket this can be. It's impossible to compare products and all of them seem to have unhappy customers that have to jump through hoops to get any warranty satisfaction. I suddenly noticed how many mattress stores there are! Not something that you notice until you're looking for one. Obviously there is a huge mark-up on a mattress or there wouldn't be so many vendors in the marketplace. We actually went to a store - the "Numbers" mattress store, where you essentially inflate a bag to get the firmness you want - for big dollars. Fortunately my wife and I are the same "number" so we didn't really need the individual adjustability, but we would never have gone for it anyway - the quality just wasn't there and the price was silly - even if you didn't add the hundreds of dollars worth of pillows, and accessory "options".

Somehow I stumbled on the Saatva site and read with some astonishment the endless 5 star reviews. When I looked at the construction I was impressed with the quality features - no gimmicks. The warranty is superior to any others and they actually honor it. I could never imagine ordering such an important purchase over the internet - but I figured with the return policy I really couldn't lose.

We received our luxury firm mattress in early December and it has been wonderful. I actually look forward to falling into bed every night. The mattress itself was beautifully made of high quality materials, The delivery process was totally smooth and professional. Two months later we couldn't be happier with the quality and comfort, and the price is a bargain in my opinion.

I have only the highest praise for the product, the service, and the value for money. 

BTW this review is completely voluntary - I have not been solicited, paid or in any way induced by Saatva. 

We all need to support and encourage the growth of USA made products -especially when they are of exemplary quality.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Best Mattress Ever
I have been looking for the last couple of years for a mattress. I was very nervous about making a decision because you really can't tell if you are going to like something by laying on it for 3 minutes in a store. And, very nervous about buying a mattress online, sight unseen.
While on Facebook, I saw the advertisement for Saatva. I started looking into it and reading the reviews. 
I liked the fact that it had coil on coil construction and not just memory foam.  I took a leap of faith and went ahead and ordered the Luxury Firm, King Size with the 8" box frames.
This was the best decision ever. I received it sooner than expected and we love it.  No more aches and pains when we get up in the morning. 
According to a tracking device I recently received, I was getting an average of 3 - 4 hours of sleep every night. Now with the new Saatva, I am getting 6 - 7 hours of sleep per night.  
I would recommend anyone who has any doubt to just try it out. I promise you'll love it.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Everything They Said it Would Be
I waited until now to write a review, now that I've had my mattress for a week.

First of all, placing the order was a breeze.  I decided to call and place my order rather than place it on line.  All my questions were answered and confirmation came right away, as well as a phone call, thanking me for the order.

The delivery date came and we eagerly awaited delivery.  Our delivery window was between 4:30pm and 6:30 pm.  When 6:30 came and went, with no call from the carrier, I contacted them.  Unfortunately they were closed.  Not knowing what to do, I contacted Saatva.  They went into action, managed to get someone from the carrier, and learned that it had been damaged in transit.  Cory, with Saatva, kept in contact with my and called at least 4 times, giving me updates.  Thanks, Cory, for giving up your Saturday evening to help a customer!

Saatva apologized profusely and, being customer focused, compensated me for the delay.  They got right on it and we received our mattress a week ago, Saturday.

Now the best part!  The mattress is unbelievably comfortable!!  I too, was a little leery ordering sight unseen but don't worry.  The product is terrific!  I love it!

The folks at Saatva get it.  They know that the customer puts the money into the equation and their focus on making the customer happy is their primary concern, both in service and quality.  

Buy a Saatva.  You'll sleep better at night!  :)Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Thank you Saatva!
I received your mattess almost 2 weeks ago. I had been "nervous" about ordering a mattress from an online store, but I did alot of research before finally choosing a Satvaa mattress. I was replacing a mattress from a well-known company. It was a torture chamber from day 1 as I felt like I was sleeping on the side of a mountain about to fall in to an abyss. Within 2 years a piece of the frame (plastic) broke and I had to take the whole thing apart to fix the frame. I was still sleeping on the side of a mountain....then the sides started to bulge out and the mattress would slide all over the base and the base would slide all over the floor. There was no helpful customer support, the mattress and base were made of shoddy materials, the whole thing started to fall apart within 5 years and was wildly overpriced. One of the air chambers finally popped and I was glad it did so I could get a traditional mattress and box spring, The day my Saatva mattress was to be delivered I took apart the old mattress and frame to toss it, and when I unzipped the cover and lifted up the foam beneath it I found black mold under the foam and top of the air chambers. I would have been delighted to sleep in a doggie bed at that point. Then the saatva arrived right on time and was delivered by polite and nice delivery men. When they left, I couldn't wait to put on sheets and try it out!  I could not believe how comfortable the bed was! For the first time in years I could sleep on my stomach and sides without pain, numbness and tingling! I forgot to mention that I am loaded with atthritis and within the last 9 years have had to have 2 back surgeries, 2 knee replacements and a right hip replacement. Bottom line...I sleep like a baby on this mattress and I am so happy I decided to take a "leap of faith" and trust the company and their incredible customer service and return policy. Thanks Saatva!Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Awesome! Back Pain Relieved
We got our matress a few days ago.  My wife has been suffering from lumbar back issues for over a year.  We have  tried IComfort, Stearns and Foster, and Beauty Rest matresses.  We even slept on an inflatable Coleman Matress with a futon pad.  Nothing worked.  The Saatva Luxery Firm matress has made a remarkable difference in my wife's back pain.  I sleep like a rock on it too!  Wonderful company, speedy delivery, and great price.  Have already recommended it to multiple friends.  Thanks for producing a quality product, in America for a great price point.  Thanks for the peace you have given to us.Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Sleep Like the Dead
Having slept fairly comfortably on mid-priced/mid-quality mattresses (purchased from Sam's Club) for the past 20 years, my wife and I decided to finally take the plunge on a higher quality luxury mattress.  Like so many other reviewers on this website, we visited several local luxury mattress stores and were not pleased with either the construction quality or the sales experience.  So, we decided to check on-line to see what was available.  And in all the research, Saatva kept coming up over and over again as one the highest rated mattress manufacturers in terms of comfort, customer service and manufacturing quality.  After an afternoon of internet research, we took the plunge and ordered the 14.5 inch Luxury Firm king-sized mattress.

As someone who has led an active athletic life-style, I have had 5 knee surgeries, serious spinal/neck injuries, and most recently I was recovering from shoulder surgery.  Following the recovery from the shoulder surgery, I was unable to return to our old tired bed because it was so uncomfortable.  I was so excited the day our Saatva mattress arrived.  My wife and I couldn't wait to get the sheets on it and try it out.

The next few night's sleep (and every night since then) have been a revelation.  No longer do I toss and turn all night with all my various damaged and surgically repaired joints screaming at me.  Sleeping on our new Saatva mattress is like sleeping on a cloud.  You close your eyes and it feels like you are floating. The moment you stretch out, all the pressure points on all the old aching joints and injuries just disappear.  My wife and I both sleep so well on this mattress, we don't even set an alarm any more.  Lay down to sleep and then wake up 7 or 8 hours later more rested than you could ever imagine.  It made me realize how badly I had actually been sleeping on our old tired mattress.

The quality of this mattress and the entire buying experience couldn't have been any better.  The Saatva mattress has literally changed my life.  I have run out of superlatives so I will wrap it up by saying "Thanks Saatva!"

7-Month Review
I am a very conscientious on-line shopper. I did a pretty thorough job on researching mattresses along with comparison pricing. It is a very, very challenging exercise and I was very reluctant almost giving up in actually buying a mattress. That's how tough it is. I made the choice to go with SAATVA and after 7-months the mattress is in the same condition it was when it first got delivered. I purchased the 14” and cannot express how much we look forward to going to bed at night as a reward for the day’s work!Was this review helpful to you? Yes No

Saatva's Special Edition Foundation

Like those found in most of today's premium interactive mattress sets, the Saatva mattress uses a rigid solid support foundation that utilizes a solid deck support with a wood slat construction for maximum mattress and body support. Additionally, they contain our eco-friendly foams and are covered in organic cotton.
Our foundations are available in two thickness options  a standard 8.75" foundation and a 4.75" low profile foundation. Both are available in twin, full, queen, king and California king sizes. There is absolutely no difference in the feel between the low profile 4.75" and the standard 8.75".


All king and Cal king size foundations come split for delivery purposes, as they do not bend. The split foundation will fit into any entrance way or doorway. Twin, full and queen all come standard in one piece.
Please note, we do have a split queen foundation available for an additional $35.00. This should be ordered if you feel a standard queen one piece foundation won't fit into your entrance way or doorway. That option is not available in full or twin.





Frame

The bed frame fits all sizes of bedding. The center rail has 3 heavy duty legs for maximum center support from head to toe. The center support can be used on all sizes for maximum stability and support. The frame has a total of 7 heavy duty legs with floor guides. The frame sits 7.5" off the ground.







Home Delivery and Set Up

Our delivery professionals will provide full-service set up in the room of your choice. We’ll also remove your old mattress, if you choose that option at checkout.

Choose comfort level 














Saatva mattresses are built with a distinctive high quality feature known as 'coil on coil' construction. Our lower coil unit offers a connected hourglass shaped steel support base. Our top coil unit features a luxurious individually wrapped coil system that contours and responds perfectly to your body, eliminating most motion transfer. Each individually wrapped coil is separate to ensure that the rest of the bed will not be disturbed by the movement of surrounding coils. This construction coupled with our advanced euro pillow top, can only be found in ultra premium mattresses that cost over $2,000 for a queen mattress. Our beds, which work with adjustable bases, are made to last 10 to 15 years and will continue to perform consistently well over time.  Note: All Saatva coil units are tempered three times and oven baked.SEE COMFORT LEVELS


We have uniquely combined the top 5 features found in ultra premium bedding and handcrafted them into one perfect and affordable luxury mattress.
Our standard premier luxury mattress is 14.5". We also make a custom slim 11.5" that was redesigned in March 2017 to work with adjustable bases, including the Lineal™ Adjustable Base by Saatva. The quality and feel of the mattresses are the same.







1
Individually Wrapped Comfort Coils

Individually wrapped coils in the top portion of the mattress are the most advanced coil system in the luxury mattress market. These coils respond and contour to every body shape.

  


2
Dual Perimeter Edge Support System


Foam encased anti-sag edge support for better durability and more sleep surface. The Saatva Mattress uses a Dual Perimeter Edge Support System. The upper comfort coils are foam encased.  This is a quality that only the most durable and best mattresses have.

  


3
Lumbar Support Enhancement


Lumbar support enhancement made of high quality memory foam layer, providing additional pressure relief while helping reduce stress and tension from the lower back.

  


4
Steel Coil Base Support System


All Saatva’s luxury mattresses are built with a tempered steel support lower coil base. This creates a long lasting, sustainable mattress with increased durability and is the best design to prevent sagging. 

  


5
Organic Cotton Cover & Euro Pillow Top


The euro pillow top offers more padding and cushioning materials than what is found in most regular pillow tops. These materials are then inserted underneath the outer covering for a neater and cleaner look. Regular pillow tops that are sewn to the top of a bed tend to shift and lose shape.

PLUSH SOFT

For sleepers who prefer to feel their mattress hug them in a supportive embrace the Plush Soft comfort level is your choice.

Our core is just the right firmness to ensure you don’t sink in too much but will conform to your unique body.

If you like to feel enveloped in your bed and linens
Have trouble with your arms falling asleep before you do
If you prefer a soft mattress

CHOOSE PLUSH SOFT



LUXURY FIRM
OUR FLAGSHIP LEVEL

The standard comfort level used in the finest hotels in the world, where their goal is to ensure every guest gets a great night sleep.

FIRM

For sleepers who prefer their mattress firm but not hard the Firm comfort level is your choice. We layer individually wrapped coils with firmer foams than our Luxury Firm to create a mattress that floats your body on the mattress as you sleep. When you lie down you will feel an initial plushness quickly followed by the firm support you desire. Our core is just the right firmness balance to ensure you don’t sink into the mattress or feel like you are sleeping on a board.  


Choose Firm:

If you prefer to sleep on your back or stomach
Prefer a mattress that you float on top of instead of sink into

First, we made the world’s most luxurious all-natural latex mattress.Then we made it affordable.



            You can pay $4,000 USD or more for a top-of-the-line latex mattress at a retail store, but it won’t match Zenhaven.
        
            Handcrafted in America of 100% natural American Talalay latex, layered with breathable 100% organic New Zealand wool and wrapped in lush organic cotton, Zenhaven takes you to new heights of comfort and health.
        
            And because it’s from Saatva, the company that’s made luxury sleep affordable, and the largest seller of American Made 100% Talalay Latex Mattresses in the United States & Canada, Zenhaven can be yours for as little as $1,899 (for Queen).
        

Pure Eco-Sleep Crafted of 100% natural latex and organic fabrics, Zenhaven offers the most comfortable sleep of your life — and the greenest.
Superior ConstructionWe use premium American Talalay latex — and American craftsmanship — to create a mattress that’s as long lasting as it is luxurious.
Healthy By NatureZenhaven’s natural latex not only provides incomparable support, it’s hypoallergenic, resistant to mold and dust mites, and free of toxins of any kind.
Saatva’s Zenhaven mattress saves you up to 70%.


 
Zenhaven is brought to you by Saatva,the web’s best-reviewed mattress company —with more than 12,000 5-star reviews.


            That may explain how we became the 7th-fastest-growing private retail company in America, according to Inc. 500.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
