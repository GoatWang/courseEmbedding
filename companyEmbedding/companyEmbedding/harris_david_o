High Quality Gift Baskets
If you want the highest quality gift baskets, luxury food gifts, and gourmet food delivered, you’ve come to the right place. Quality gourmet gift baskets are brimming with the finest quality sweet and savory delights available, with premium fresh fruit from our orchards, famous chocolate truffles, and the best quality gourmet foods from around the country. Adding little touches like expertly paired wine or a personalized note makes quality gift baskets like ours that much better. 
We grow, make, or bake many of our specialty gifts right here in our home in Southern Oregon to ensure the highest quality gift baskets. It all started in 1934 with an orchard, two brothers, and a dream from our founders, Harry and David Holmes.
Types of Gift Baskets 
There are gift baskets for all occasions! Some types of gift baskets include wine or fruits perfectly paired with gourmet cheeses and charcuterie. Other types of gift baskets have savory delights like soups and appetizer spreads, or gourmet chocolate gifts with exceptional chocolate truffles. Our gourmet gift basket types include: 
 Gift Baskets with Wine
 Fruit Baskets
 Holiday Gift Baskets
 Special Occasion Gift Baskets
Sympathy Gift Baskets

Sending a Gift Basket 
Sending a gift basket starts with choosing the type of gift basket that matches the occasion. From get well gifts and sympathy gifts to happy birthday and congratulations, sending an expertly crafted gourmet gift basket full of delights and comforts is the best way to show you care. Add a touch of elegance to the gift basket you send with a perfectly paired bottle of our premium wine, or add your own sentiments with a personalized note. 
Sending a personalized gourmet gift basket of your choice has never been this easy. You can choose from standard or expedited shipping, and we can even hold your order for a specific delivery date of your choice. Many gift baskets can be customized with wine, chocolates, and other delightful options.

David Harris signing with Patriots

	Posted by Josh Alper on June 21, 2017, 10:32 AM EDT

 Getty ImagesThe Jets cut linebacker David Harris as part of their offseason purge of veterans from the roster, but it looks like they’ll still be seeing him twice during the 2017 season.
Adam Schefter of ESPN reports and PFT has confirmed that Harris will sign a two-year contract with the Patriots after visiting with the team.
Harris turned 33 in January and isn’t playing at the same level he was when he helped the Jets to a playoff win in New England after the 2010 season, but he’s remained an effective player over the intervening years. He’ll join a linebacking corps that had room for some added depth before training camp and a team that has spent this offseason loading up on veteran additions as they try to repeat as Super Bowl champions.
That’s unlikely to elicit many smiles among Jets fans who are girding themselves for what looks like a long season in New Jersey, but such is life in the shadow of the Patriots these days.

We could honestly use another LB. I actually don’t see how Shea McLellan stays on the roster. Besides HT, Van Noy, and Roberts, it has been discussed about the need for another LB. Always thought Harris was a solid player with a great attitude.

Jets fans will be gnashing their teeth and chewing off their own extremities this season Patriots or no Patriots.
The obvious work to put a fraudulent product on the field this season by Woody Johnson and cronies is going to be the cause, not the Pats.


 






redclaw1314 says:
Jun 21, 2017 10:41 AM 

Great move to add an experienced linebacker from the division.  Belichick knows what he is getting. Reminds me of the Roman Phifer (33yo also) signing back in 2001 who was instrumental in their superbowl run.
Thank you Jets.

patsxsaintsfan says:
Jun 21, 2017 10:43 AM 

He isn’t the player he once was but that doesn’t mean he can’t still be effective. The patriots team is adding depth at key positions but my only concern this season is where’s the pass rush coming from? Trey flowers and Ealy have shown a lot of potential but this season they need to take a big step forward in consistency to replace role players like Long and Sheard.  I think the team will be fine but to make this defense an elite unit someone on the D-line needs to step up. We need pressure when Hightower is in coverage not just when he blitzes.


 






robkeezy says:
Jun 21, 2017 10:46 AM 

That’s exactly what the Jets deserve for cutting someone who was a leader in the locker room, a sure tackler who was the brains of the middle of that defense, and a loyal franchise player. I’m sick right now.
Signed,
Life Long Jets Fan

Nailed it.
1st and 2nd down 3-4 MLB formations, likely with Hightower being worked at 3-4 OLB.

The Jets have already tanked the season.  They are looking at last place in the AFC East.  Macagnan and Bowles need to be fired at the end of the season and then just let the Jets implode.   Fifty years of mismanagement and futility and they still have no franchise QB.  Dumb. Dumb. Dumb.  Go figure that one out.

“Macagnan and Bowles need to be fired at the end of the season and then just let the Jets implode.”
Bowles is actually a decent coach whose been handed bad rosters from the start, with the management above him continuing to sabotage his efforts with their further roster moves.

It doesn’t matter.
Patsies lose to the RAIDERS in Mexico.

Raider fans make me smile, thinking they’re the best team in the league despite actually doing nothing for years.
As a Pats fan, I’d love to see Pats/Raiders in the AFC title game, because I know the Pats would drop 40 on that D.

As a Jets fan, couldn’t be happier for Harris. After playing for so many losing Jets teams, he deserves to play with a great one. Unlike the Jets front office, the fans haven’t forgotten about you or your contributions David. Best of luck!


 






intrafinesse says:
Jun 21, 2017 12:07 PM 

Harris is smart but very slow.  He’s not going to cover anybody.  He can strill stop a run, but isn’t as good at shedding blocks.
It all comes down to how much he’s getting paid.
Considering he spent his career with the Jets, why not have a shot at a ring with the Pats?
Good luck to Harris.


 






whispersd says:
Jun 21, 2017 12:17 PM 

Classic Belichick move, like bringing in Roman Phifer or Junior Seau.  Harris isn’t in his prime, but he’s still a very smart and aggressive player.


 






dynaco says:
Jun 21, 2017 1:07 PM 

That signing should water down their roster a little.


 






psljax says:
Jun 21, 2017 1:19 PM 

The NFL is turning into the NBA. Teams purposefully tanking a year for the hope of a franchise QB for the years to come. Problem is without coaching, franchise QBs are not successful.  There is a reason Patriots green bay are successful with franchise and while other teams with franchise type qbs-bolts and colts hostorically suck.
Suck for luck worked to get to the playoffs in a real weak division. How is it working for them now

Sometimes the veteran smarts are more important than the physicality. A guy like that comes up with a huge stop in the big game.

I love the Jets as much as I hate the Pats.  David Harris was our most consistent and devoted player for a long time.  Considering that the Jets are a lock for last place in the East anyway (and look to be serious contenders for the league’s worst record), I’m happy Harris will be somewhere that he can be productive and enjoying his team’s success.  It will finally give me a silver lining if the Pats win again.

Umm, no, we’re not. No one has said anything of the sort. I will say BB’s money guaranateed proves Harris will make the team for at least 1 year.
The concept is very similar to that of Shaun Ellis in 2011. Used less than usual, but in small ways to help and add a veteran with experience.
Have a nice day, Mr. Jealous.

Yes, a loaded team adding a humble, older player who has played in an embarrassing environment for his whole career, somehow will sabotage a loaded 2017 Pats team.

Raider fans make me smile, thinking they’re the best team in the league despite actually doing nothing for years.
As a Pats fan, I’d love to see Pats/Raiders in the AFC title game, because I know the Pats would drop 40 on that D.
————-
That’s a little too optimistic , I think the Pats only score 9 or 10 touchdowns, 12 at the most.

Chowds wonder what went wrong and stomp, pout and throw a tantrum like the petulant children they are.
Carry on.

Everything to know about Jets training camp




David Harris found a new home Wednesday, and it is one that will make Jets fans sick.
The longtime Jets linebacker agreed to a two-year deal worth up to $6.75 million with the Patriots, according to a source. Harris, who spent his first 10 years with the Jets, will now get a chance to win a Super Bowl with their arch nemesis.
Seeing Harris in a New England uniform will be a tough vision for Jets fans. Harris has been one of the most reliable, consistent Jets since the team drafted him in 2007. He will be the latest player to switch uniforms in the rivalry — joining players like Darrelle Revis and Curtis Martin, and coaches like Bill Belichick and Bill Parcells.
The Jets unceremoniously dumped Harris on June 6, a shocking move because of the timing. The 33-year-old left the team as the No. 2 all-time tackler in franchise history, and was a total pro on and off the field. Instead of cutting him in February or March, when most moves are made with veteran players, the Jets held onto him until June, then owner Woody Johnson decided he did not want to pay Harris the $6.5 million he was due to make this season in a penny-pinching move. The Jets informed Eric Decker they were cutting him on the same day to clear more salary.
Harris will be a perfect fit in Belichick’s no-nonsense culture. Harris had several suitors, according to a source, but ultimately felt like the Patriots were the best fit for him. It will be interesting to see how the Patriots use Harris. They have Dont’a Hightower in the middle but used several other linebackers alongside him last year. Belichick is known for getting the most out of players, and he surely has a plan that will play to Harris’ strengths.

Harris’ most memorable moment as a Jet came against the Patriots, when he intercepted Tom Brady in a 28-21 divisional playoff win following the 2010 season. Belichick always has spoken highly of Harris through the years.
“I have a lot of respect for David Harris,” Belichick said a few years ago before the Jets and Patriots played. “That guy is, first of all, he never comes off the field — not [just] this year, but any year. The guy is like a 98, 99 percent play-time player for them every year, year after year.
“It’s obviously a defense that has a lot of communication and adjustments, and he’s certainly at the center of that. Both as the signal caller and then at the line of scrimmage, you can see him adjusting the front or making some type of communication calls to his teammates. He’s a very instinctive player, which unfortunately we’ve seen that firsthand. He does a good job for them. He’s been very consistent, durable, dependable, productive over a long period of time.”
This is the latest blow for Jets fans as the organization dismantles the roster in order to get younger and cheaper in 2017, with the hopes they can land a top draft pick next year. If Harris went to any other team, it would have been easier for Jets fans to deal with. Instead, he joined the Evil Empire, and the Jets now will see him twice this year and perhaps hoisting the Lombardi Trophy in February.
