Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H.

Early life and education[edit]
Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

Mindy Grossman was born September 8, 1957.[2] Her adoptive parents were Donald and Elaine Waldman, a Jewish produce dealer and homemaker on Long Island, New York, who had married young but had been unable to have children.[3][4]
She attended Manhattanville College in Westchester County, New York, and transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C.[5] She intended to go to law school after graduation. However, in her senior year at George Washington University, she broke off her engagement to her high-school boyfriend and dropped her plans to attend law school, and instead moved to New York City to go into the fashion industry.[3][4]
Career[edit]
1977–1991[edit]
Grossman moved to New York City in 1977, and was offered a job working for a company called Manhattan International. It was a menswear conglomerate at the time, and she was an assistant to the president of their international division.[3][6][7] From 1978 to 1980, she was an account executive at Jeffrey Banks menswear.[7] From 1980 to 1981, she was an account executive at Ron Chereskin menswear.[7] From 1981 to 1985, she was a regional sales manager at Merona, and then vice-president of sales at Jeffrey Banks; both Merona and Jeffrey Banks were at the time divisions of Oxford Industries.[7][8]
From 1985 to 1988, Grossman worked for WilliWear by Willi Smith. She started out as Vice President of Sales and in 1987 became Vice President of Menswear.[7][9][10]
From 1988 to 1991 she was Vice President of Sales and Merchandising at Tommy Hilfiger.[7] She was in nearly on the ground floor at Tommy Hilfiger, which had been incorporated in 1985.[4] Grossman later recalled, "At the time, it was a small company, and sales were meteoric. They went from around $38 million to $350 million."[7]
1991–2006[edit]
Ralph Lauren[edit]
From 1991 to 2000, Grossman worked for brands by Ralph Lauren. From 1991 to 1994, she was President of Chaps Ralph Lauren, a division of Warnaco, Inc., and she was Senior Vice President of Menswear for Warnaco, Inc. during those years as well.[5][7][11] Chaps was Ralph Lauren's midprice department-store brand;[4] She turned around the Chaps division and grew its annual revenues from $26 million to $250 million.[1][12]
She was Vice-President of New Business Development at Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation from 1994 to 1995.[5] During that period, she developed new brand concepts, including Polo Jeans. She convinced Lauren that in order to attract customers at a younger age he needed to embrace new ideas, and that Polo Jeans Company was a good way to make lifelong customers out of a younger audience.[13] Grossman calls starting Polo Jeans "my start-up experience";[3] she was its President and CEO from 1995 to 2000,[7] launched the brand in 1996,[14] and took it from a standing start to a $450 million business,[1][4] building it into the leading department store status denim brand.[15]
Nike[edit]
In 2000, Grossman joined Nike, Inc., where she served as Vice President of Global Apparel from 2000 to 2006, overseeing its worldwide multi-billion-dollar apparel business.[7] Nike CEO Phil Knight had brought her in to revive Nike's sagging apparel business,[15][16][17] capitalizing on her expertise in fashion, brand strategy, product development, and retail space management.[18]
In her capacity as head of global apparel, she oversaw global strategic planning; product development; and global apparel manufacturing, operations, sourcing, merchandising, advanced innovation, quality assurance, and compliance and sustainability. She was also responsible for Nike's women's business.[19] She aggressively and successfully reengineered the entire apparel organization, and created three sub-brands for Nike apparel: Nike Performance, targeted to athletes and aspirational consumers; Nike Active, a line to be worn from gym to street; and Nike Fusion, apparel with higher-performance fabrics and aggressive styling.[20] Under her leadership, Nike also rolled out new NikeWomen stores, launched NikeWomen catalogues, and started a new division called Fitness Dance.[20] She advanced Nike's apparel innovation agenda, led the development and growth of the global women's business, and created and co-chaired Nike’s Global Women’s Leadership Council.[1][21]
Grossman was credited with showing a footwear company how to be an apparel company.[20] She brought her strong fashion background to Nike's apparel and regenerated it, devoting much of her energy to the company's weaker women's wear business.[20] Nike's apparel business's annual revenue was $2.7 billion when she joined in 2000;[16] by the end of fiscal year 2005 she had grown it to $4.1 billion,[20] which was 32% of Nike brand revenues.[22]
2006 to present: HSN[edit]
Arrival at HSN[edit]
By 2006, after six years at Nike, Grossman desired a CEO position, preferably in a company where she did not need to commute across the country as she did at Nike. Nike had recently appointed its own new CEO and a new president, so she actively looked to find an opportunity in another company, seeking this time one that was direct-to-consumer, entrepreneurial but not a start-up, and one that she could transform by taking advantage of new technological advances. A recruiter approached her about IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC), the parent company of HSN, Inc., and after studying HSN's broadcasts she realized that, in her words, "HSN really needed to become more of a lifestyle network that would inspire people through products".[1] Her vision was to offer inspiring lifestyle programming, particularly with charismatic celebrities, with all the products for sale – rather than the usual dry and old-fashioned standard sales format.[4]
She took the idea to Barry Diller, the head of IAC, and even though she had no television experience, no direct-to-consumer experience, and no experience in most of the product categories HSN sold, he hired her.[1][4] In April 2006, Grossman was appointed CEO of IAC Retailing, overseeing HSN, the catalog company Cornerstone Brands, Shoebuy.com, and IAC's international retailing operations.[19]
HSN had had seven CEOs in the previous 10 years, and according to Grossman the company, offices, and employees seemed downtrodden and frozen in time.[1] One of her first actions was to throw out all the old, broken, or dirty office furniture and give all employees Aeron chairs.[1] In order to focus on revitalizing HSN, she closed IAC's failing UK auction business, sold its German shopping channel, closed the down-market DirecTV clearance-shopping channel, and put another executive in charge of Cornerstone brands.[1] She also eliminated negative or "toxic" employees, sought out committed, knowledgeable people within and outside the company to head up important divisions, and ensured that all employees were on board with the company's new vision.[1][4]
She also found that the network and brand itself was a "very stagnant, linear, non-immersive experience".[23] By October 2006 she rolled out HSN's new brand image, tagline, vision statement, customer intention, and advertising. The company's new manifesto was "to create a new lifestyle experience for consumers".[1] To implement the plan, she stopped selling $150 million worth of unsuitable brands, and worked hard to entice higher-end brands, and new personalities to sell products.[1] Among many others, early on she recruited Sephora, Emeril Lagasse, and Todd English to sell on air. She also aired a two-hour fashion show of high-end apparel.[1] In addition, she brought the company's call centers back to the U.S. from overseas.[23][24]
HSN relaunch and taking the company public[edit]
By mid 2007 the relaunch and redesign of HSN's channel, website, and campus were in effect, and the business started to turn around.[1] In November of that year, Diller decided to break up IAC into several of its constituent companies, and to spin off HSN, Inc. as a public company via an IPO with Grossman as CEO.[1][25] The IPO launched in August 2008.[26] A few weeks later the Lehman Brothers collapse occurred, with the subsequent stock-market plunge and recession. Grossman kept HSN afloat and thriving during the tenuous recessional years of 2008 and 2009 via intense economies and stringent dedication to her vision, and by tailoring HSN's marketing to her customers' needs to economize.[27][28][29]
She continued to aggressively transform, redefine, and reinvent the HSN brand, improving its demographics and increasing the value of its stock from $10 at its IPO in August 2008 to $55 a share in 2014.[29] HSN's success fostered the launch of a second 24-hour television channel, HSN2, in 2010.[30][31] Grossman's turn-around approach was multi-faceted: she upgraded product level to high-end products; aggressively and preemptively implemented numerous digital and mobile access options; made the shopping experience fun, immersive, entertaining, creative, informative, exciting, interactive, and inspiring; and brought on board major celebrities and high-end fashion designers to sell their lines, most of them exclusive to HSN.[32][33][34]
Under her leadership HSN became a multi-platform business, providing a seamless shopping experience across multiple channels and platforms, accessible anytime and anywhere, that was entertaining, fun, and exciting.[5][35][36] Forbes and Fortune termed the new brand a "hybrid" – a media, entertainment, technology, and retail business.[28][37]
Determined to stay ahead of the curve on the technology front,[38] Grossman also introduced new HSN venues including Shop by Remote (television remote control shopping), HSN Arcade (online games), Video on Demand, HSN Live, shopping via YouTube, and in-flight shopping.[21][36] She overhauled HSN's website and made HSN a major e-commerce presence;[24][29] as of 2013 HSN.com is one of the top 10 most-trafficked e-commerce sites.[12][39] She evolved HSN from a linear network to a multi-platform business, creating a "boundaryless" retail;[33][35] according to Fast Company, nearly half the HSN's revenue comes through digital platforms.[34]
She recruited major celebrities such as Jennifer Lopez, Queen Latifah, Mariah Carey, Iman, Mary J. Blige, P. Diddy, Padma Lakshmi, Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, Keith Urban, Nicki Minaj, Mary J. Blige, and Serena Williams, and major cosmetics companies such as Lancôme and Stila, to appear on the network and sell their own brands of merchandise, most of them exclusively created for HSN.[32] She brought in high-end fashion designers to sell exclusive fashion lines on the network, garnering Grossman and HSN a front row at Fashion Week.[1][23][24] She also created partnerships with major companies like Disney and other Hollywood studios to sell merchandise, invited movie and television-series tie-ins, and aired live concerts by singers such as Rod Stewart and Randy Travis.[32][32][37][40][41]
HSN became a Fortune 1000 company in 2009.[42] As of 2014, Grossman is one of only 51 women who lead a Fortune 1000 company.[43][44] In 2015, Fortune published an article stating that from 2002 through 2014, Fortune 1000 companies led by women have performed three times better than the S&P 500, and that HSN's returns since its IPO were one of the top two, even despite the stock-market meltdown which immediately followed its initial public offering.[45] Other retailers, including Penney's, Target, and Avon, have attempted to recruit Grossman to head their companies.[32][46][47][48]
Directorships and advisories[edit]
Grossman has been a director of HSN, Inc. since it went public in August 2008.[5][49] She has been a director of Bloomin’ Brands since 2012.[35] She serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Vice Chair of, the National Retail Federation.[50] She also serves on the Board of Directors of, and as of 2015 is Chair of, the National Retail Federation Foundation, the charitable arm of the National Retail Federation.[51][52]
She is the Chair of the Advisory Board of Fashion Institute of Technology’s Executive Women in Fashion.[53] She is a member of the Industry Advisory Board of the Jay H. Baker Retailing Center at the Wharton School of Business.[54] She is also an advisor at the venture capital firm Metamorphic Ventures.[55]
Grossman is on the Board of Directors of the United States Fund for UNICEF.[21] She also founded and spearheads HSN Cares, the philanthropic arm of HSN.[56][57]
In June 2017, Grossman joined the Board of Directors of sports apparel e-commerce retailer Fanatics.[58]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
