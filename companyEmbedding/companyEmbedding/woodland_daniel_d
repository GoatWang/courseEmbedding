Method of making an easily cleanable polymer laminate



Patent number:  7846507
                                            

Abstract:  A method for preparing a substrate having an adherent, durable, flexible, and stain resistant layer. The layer is formed by applying a composition that includes (i) the reaction product of a polyester and a polyoxetane having at least one carboxylic acid end group and at least one pendant —CH2—O—(CH2)n—Rf group and (ii) an amino resin curative. The substrate may be printed or embossed or both. The coated substrate has both stain resistant properties and dry erase properties.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant
                                            

Filed: 
                        October 15, 2004
                    

Date of Patent: 
                                                        December 7, 2010

Fluorinated polymer and amine resin compositions and products formed therefrom



Patent number:  7320829
                                            

Abstract:  A reactive fluorinated polymer having polyester and polyether segments is mixed with a reactive melamine resin to form a coating composition. The polyether segment can include monomeric units from an oxetane monomer having pendant fluorine groups that are linked to the oxetane via an ether group. The melamine resin can be a lower alkyl etherified melamine-formaldehyde. The composition can be disposed on a substrate and treated to form a laminate.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Polymeric surfactants derived from cyclic monomers having pendant fluorinated carbon groups



Patent number:  7087710
                                            

Abstract:  A fluorine containing polymer which acts as a wetting, flow or leveling agent, and has at least one polar group. The polymer has at least one pendant or ether side chain containing from about 1 to about 20 carbon atoms with at least 25% of the hydrogen atoms being replaced by fluorine atoms. The fluorinated polymers unexpectedly impart wetting, flow or leveling properties to a variety of coatings while producing little foam.

Cured polyesters containing fluorinated side chains



Patent number:  6686051
                                            

Abstract:  A polyester polymer includes at least one hydroxyl terminated polyoxetane block containing repeat units derived from polymerizing at least one oxetane monomer having a pendant —CH2—O—(CH2)n—Rf group wherein said Rf group is partially or fully fluorinated. A preferred process for forming said polymer is by reacting a hydroxyl terminated polyoxetane with a polycarboxylic acid under appropriate conditions to form an ester linkage and then adding and reacting that product with polyester forming reactants. The polyester polymer containing at least one polyoxetane block therein when reacted with an amino resin curative can be used as a coating on a substrate wherein the coating has dry erase properties. The coated substrate can be used as prepared or applied to yet other substrates.

              Woodland Records           	
Woodland records are appropriate for the city of Woodland. While the courtroom is what you might think about when considering Woodland records, these files are now accessible online. You can search Woodland records via a third party compilation. These databases have Woodland records which are based on the paper files held by the state. These files will certainly save you a trip or a formal request session. 

Searching for these files can return items such as voter ID records, court room dockets, police sheriff reports and local incidents as recorded by the authorities even if there hasn't been an arrest. These Woodland records are assured to you, based on the 1960s ruling of the Freedom of Information Act. Ever since then, the states have cooperated with the federal government to give the public for transparency regarding these files. 

Woodland records can be searched for marriage and divorce documents as well as criminal records and lawsuits mentioned in accordance with a person's name. Woodland records also include death certificates and DOB files from vital records. 

Woodland records are always anonymous and easy to search. No searches are saved or logged and the only one knows of this action is you. Why not look now for what matches you can find?

Miniature Tree House


By: Bill Blevins					                     from FORT WORTH, TX US on February 16, 2016



The rating is 5-Stars!  I ordered the Miniature Tree House and it was promptly delivered.  I asked for an inscription that said Happy 35th Wedding Anniversary.  When it arrived, the inscription was on the bottom as I had requested.  This is a beautiful work of art and truly unique.  I highly recommend it for anyone.  I also praise Daniels for meeting my request.  It will make this gift mean even more as it is passed down to future generations.  What a great gift, love the show, and many thanks to all at Daniels.  Great job!  God Bless!

I cannot thank you enough for the incredible structure that rules over our yard now. Any child, and most adults for that matter, are just shocked when they round our corner and see the tree house (Will asked me to get a lock for it to keep other kids out- haha). I mean literally stop-in-your-tracks-and-hang-your-mouth-open shocked. It is truly, truly cool.
