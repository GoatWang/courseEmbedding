For the UK fund types, see Unit trust and Investment trust.
In U.S. financial law, a unit investment trust (UIT) is an exchange-traded mutual fund offering a fixed (unmanaged) portfolio of securities having a definite life. Unlike open-end and closed-end investment companies, a UIT has no board of directors. [1] A UIT is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is classified as an investment company.[2] UITs are assembled by a sponsor and sold through brokerage firms to investors.[3]

Types[edit]
A UIT portfolio may contain one of several different types of securities. The two main types are stock (equity) trusts and bond (fixed-income) trusts.
Unlike a mutual fund, a UIT is created for a specific length of time and is a fixed portfolio, meaning that the UIT’s securities will not be sold or new ones bought, except in certain limited situations (for instance, when a company is filing for bankruptcy or the sale is required due to a merger).[4]
Stock trusts[edit]
Stock trusts are generally designed to provide capital appreciation and/or dividend income. They usually issue as many units (shares) as necessary for a set period of time before their primary offering period closes. Equity trusts have a set termination date, on which the trust liquidates and distributes its net asset value as proceeds to the unitholders. (The unitholders may then have special options for the reinvestment of this principal.)
Bond trusts[edit]
Bond trusts issue a set number of units, and when they are all sold to investors, the trust's primary offering period is closed. Bond trusts pay monthly income, often in relatively consistent amounts, until the first bond in the trust is called or matures. When this occurs, the funds from the redemption are distributed to the clients via a pro-rata return of principal. The trust then continues paying the new monthly income amount until the next bond is redeemed. This continues until all the bonds have been liquidated out of the trust. Bond trusts are generally appropriate for clients seeking current income and stability of principal.
Legal status and documents[edit]
A UIT may be constituted as either a regulated investment company (RIC) or a grantor trust. A RIC is a trust, corporation or partnership in which investors have common investment and voting rights but do not have direct interest in investments of the investment company or fund. A grantor trust, in contrast, grants investors proportional ownership in the underlying securities.
A UIT is created by a document called the Trust Indenture. This document is drafted by the Sponsor of the fund, and names the Trustee and the Evaluator. By US law, the Sponsor and the Trustee may not be the same. The sponsor selects and assembles the securities to be included in the fund. The trustee keeps the securities, maintains unitholder records, and performs all accounting and tax reporting for the portfolio. The largest issuer of UITs is First Trust Portfolios. Other sponsors include Incapital, SmartTrust, Invesco Unit Trusts, Millington Securities, Advisors Asset Management[5] and Guggenheim Funds. Most large brokerage firms (such as Merrill Lynch and LPL Financial) sell UITs created by these sponsors.
Tax perspective[edit]
From a tax perspective, UIT's offer a shelter from the unrealized capital gains taxes typical inside of a mutual fund. Because individual UIT's are assembled and purchased for specific periods of time, the cost basis consists of the initial purchase price of the securities held in the trust. A mutual fund on the other hand, taxes the individual based on the entire previous tax year regardless of the date purchased. An investor could, for example, purchase a mutual fund in October, absorb a loss during the last quarter of the year, and yet still be taxed on capital gains within the fund depending on the overall performance of the underlying securities from January 1 of the current year. A UIT avoids this potential tax consequence by assembling an entirely new "investment" for each individual investor.
Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are technically classified as UITs: however, ETFs usually do not have set portfolios (they are either managed or update automatically to follow an index), and can have lifetimes of over 100 years. For example, the SPDR S&P 500 Trust is scheduled to terminate January 21, 2118,[6] and the PowerShares QQQ Trust is scheduled to terminate March 4, 2124.[7]

Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 invests in a portfolio of intermediate-term corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds, including Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The Trust is a unit investment trust included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 514. Monthly Distributions Estimated Current Return: 3.84% Estimated Long Term Return: 3.39% Estimated current return shows the estimated cash you should receive each year divided by the Unit price. Estimated long term return shows the estimated return over the estimated life of your Trust. These estimates are as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit and will vary thereafter. We base this estimate on an average of the bond yields over their estimated life. This estimate also reflects the sales charge and estimated expenses. We derive the average yield for your portfolio by weighting each bond's yield by its value and estimated life. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long term return accounts for maturities, discounts and premiums of the bonds. These estimates show a comparison rather than a prediction of returns. No return calculation can predict your actual return. Your actual return may vary from these estimates.3 You should read this prospectus and retain it for future reference. July 27, 2015 The Securities and Exchange Commission has not approved or disapproved of the Trust Units or passed upon the adequacy or accuracy of this prospectus. Any contrary representation is a criminal offense. INVESCO Investment Objective. The Trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. Principal Investment Strategy. The Trust invests in a portfolio of intermediate-term corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds, including Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. In selecting bonds for the Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: o all ratings provided for the bonds must be at least "BBB-" if issued by either Standard & Poor's or Fitch Ratings, and at least "Baa3" if issued by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. or, in the case of a bond with no issued ratings, such a bond has credit characteristics sufficiently similar to those of comparable bonds that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Trust in the opinion of the Sponsor; o the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; o the current income provided by the bonds; o the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; and o the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to provisions in The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a subsidy payment from the United States Treasury ("Treasury") equal to 35% of the interest payable on such bonds, on or about each interest payment date (45% for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds). Build America Bonds must have been issued before January 1, 2011 to finance governmental purposes for which tax-exempt governmental bonds (excluding private activity bonds) could be issued, however the excess of available project proceeds over amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund may be used to finance only capital expenditures. Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. Qualified School Construction Bonds are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may be issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types. Generally, any Qualified Bond sale proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer three years after the issue date of such bonds will be redeemed within 90 days of the expiration of the three-year period. Federal legislation imposes requirements on Build America Bonds and Qualified Bonds that issuers must continue to meet in order to receive ongoing federal subsidy payments. The portfolio generally consists of corporate bonds and taxable municipal bonds maturing approximately 7 to 13 years from the Date of Deposit. Following the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced, even to below "investment grade" ("BBB-" or "Baa3"), and the Trust could continue to hold such bond. See "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration". Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in the Trust. The Trust also might not perform as well as you expect. This can happen for reasons such as these: o Bond prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall over time. o The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future. o A bond issuer or insurer may be unable to make interest and/or principal payments in the future. In particular, should the issuer of a Build America Bond or Qualified Bond fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the Recovery Act,4 it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. o The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary offering period. o The financial markets, including those for corporate bonds, have recently experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility. Due to these significant difficulties in the financial markets, there can be substantial uncertainty in assessing the value of an issuer's assets or the extent of its obligations. For these or other reasons, the ratings of the bonds in the Trust's portfolio may not accurately reflect the current financial condition or prospects of the issuer of the bond. o A bond issuer might prepay or "call" a bond before its stated maturity. If this happens, the Trust will distribute the principal to you but future interest distributions will fall. A bond's call price could be less than the price the Trust paid for the bond. In particular, Qualified Bonds may be redeemed approximately three years after issuance to the extent an issuer has unexpended bond sale proceeds. If enough bonds are called, the Trust could terminate earlier than expected. o We do not actively manage the Trust's portfolio. Except in limited circumstances, the Trust will hold the same bonds even if the market value declines.

This could include a call or sale at a price below par value. We cannot guarantee that the value of your Units will equal the principal amount of bonds per Unit when you redeem them or when your Trust terminates. (2) During the initial offering period, part of the value of the Units represents an amount of cash deposited to pay all or a portion of the costs of organizing the Trust. The estimated organization costs per Unit will be deducted from the assets of the Trust at the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the end of the initial offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to any such reduction, these costs will not be deducted from the redemption proceeds. Organization costs are not included in the Public Offering Price per Unit for purposes of calculating the sales5 charge. (3) After the first settlement date (July 30, 2015), you will pay accrued interest from this date to your settlement date less interest distributions. (4) This shows estimated expenses in the first year other than organization costs. Organization costs are not deducted from interest income. (5) Your Trust assesses this fee per $1,000 principal amount of bonds. Your Trust assesses other fees per Unit. (6) We base this amount on estimated cash flows per Unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and maturity, call or sale of bonds. The Information Supplement includes the estimated cash flows.

Notes to Portfolio (1) The bonds are represented by "regular way" or "when issued" contracts for the performance of which an irrevocable letter of credit, obtained from an affiliate of the Trustee, has been deposited with the Trustee. Contracts to acquire the bonds were entered into during the period from July 17, 2015 to July 27, (2) The Offering Price to Trust of the bonds is based on the offering side valuation as of the opening of business on the Date of Deposit determined by the Evaluator, a third party valuation provider, on the basis set forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". In accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC"), ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the Trust's investments are classified as Level 2, which refers to security prices determined using other significant observable inputs. Observable inputs are inputs that other market participants would use in pricing a security. These may include quoted market prices for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds and credit risk. The cost of the bonds to the Sponsor for the Trust is $5,757,725 and the Sponsor's profit or (loss) is $40,125. "+" indicates that the bond was issued by a foreign company. The Sponsor may have entered into contracts which hedge interest rate fluctuations on certain bonds. The cost of any such contracts and the corresponding gain or loss as of the evaluation time of the bonds is included in the Cost to Sponsor. Bonds marked by "##" following the maturity date have been purchased on a "when, as and if issued" or "delayed delivery" basis. Interest on these bonds begins accruing to the benefit of Unitholders on their respective dates of delivery. Delivery is expected to take place at various dates after the first settlement date. "#" prior to the coupon rate indicates that the bond was issued at an original issue discount. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". The tax effect of bonds issued at an original issue discount is described in "Federal Tax Status". (3) All ratings are by Standard & Poor's and Moody's, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. "*" indicates a security rating by Fitch. "NR" indicates that the rating service did not provide a rating for that bond. For a brief description of the ratings see "Description of Ratings" in the Information Supplement. (4) With respect to any bonds presenting a redemption feature in this column, this is the year in which each bond is initially or currently callable and the call price for that year. Each bond continues to be callable at declining prices thereafter (but not below par value) except for original issue discount bonds which are redeemable at prices based on the issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium, the amount of which will decline in subsequent years. "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds. The bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". (5) Certain bonds have a "make whole" call option and are redeemable in whole or in part at any time at the option of the issuer at a redemption price that is generally equal to the sum of the principal amount of such bond, a "make whole" amount, and any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The "make whole" amount is generally equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the aggregate present value as of the date of redemption of principal being redeemed and the amount of interest (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) that would have been payable if redemption had not been made, determined by discounting the remaining principal and interest at a specified rate (which varies from bond to bond and is generally equal to an average of yields on U.S. Treasury obligations or municipal obligations, as applicable, with maturities corresponding to the remaining life of the bond plus a premium rate) from the dates on which the principal and interest would have7 been payable if the redemption had not been made, over (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the bonds being redeemed. In addition, the bonds may also be subject to redemption without premium at any time pursuant to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". Underwriting. The Underwriters named below have purchased Units in the following amounts from the Sponsor, the sole and exclusive principal underwriter. See "Public Offering--Sponsor and Underwriter Compensation".

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on such statement of condition based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the statement of condition is free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the statement of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall statement of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities as shown in the statement of condition as of July 27, We believe that our audit of the statement of condition provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the statement of condition referred to above presents fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Investment Grade Income Trust, 7-13 Year Series 49 (included in Invesco Unit Trusts, Taxable Income Series 514) as of July 27, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The contracts to purchase bonds are collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit in an amount sufficient to satisfy such contracts. (2) The Trustee will advance the amount of the net interest accrued to the first settlement date to the Trust for distribution to the Sponsor as the Unitholder of record as of such date. (3) A portion of the public offering price represents an amount of cash sufficient to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the Trust. The amount of these costs are set forth under "Summary of Essential Financial Information--Expenses". A distribution will be made as of the earlier of six months after the Date of Deposit or the close of the initial offering period to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of the investors will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs of the Trust are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust. THE TRUSTS General. Your Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust Indenture and Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date of this prospectus (the "Date of Deposit") among Invesco Capital Markets, Inc., as Sponsor, Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc., as Evaluator, Invesco Investment Advisers LLC, as Supervisor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee. Your Trust may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of taxable bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. Diversification of a Trust's assets will not eliminate the risk of loss always inherent in the ownership of bonds. In addition, bonds of the type initially deposited in the portfolio of a Trust are often not available in small amounts and may, in the case of any privately placed bonds, be available only to institutional investors. On the Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee the aggregate principal amount of bonds indicated in the "Summary of Essential Financial Information". The bonds initially consist of delivery statements relating to contracts for their purchase and cash, cash equivalents and/or irrevocable letters of credit issued by a financial institution. Thereafter, the Trustee, in exchange for the bonds, delivered to the Sponsor evidence of ownership of the number of Units indicated under "Summary of Essential Financial Information". A Trust that holds primarily intermediate-term bonds, as described on the cover of the prospectus, is referred to herein as an "Intermediate-Term Trust". Unless otherwise terminated as provided herein, the Trust Agreement will terminate at the end of the calendar year prior to the twentieth anniversary of its execution in the case of an Intermediate Term Trust. Each Unit initially offered represents a fractional undivided interest in the principal and net income of the Trust. The number of Units is determined based upon a $1,000 principal amount of bonds in the Trust per Unit. To the extent that any Units are redeemed by the Trustee, the fractional undivided interest in the Trust represented by each Unit will increase, although the actual interest in the Trust will remain unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed by Unitholders or until the termination of the Trust Agreement. Objective and Bond Selection. The objective of an Intermediate-Term Trust is to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of intermediate-term bonds. There is, of course, no guarantee that a Trust will achieve its objective. Your Trust may be an appropriate investment vehicle for investors who desire to participate in a portfolio of fixed income bonds with greater diversification than they might be able to acquire individually. In selecting bonds for each Trust, the Sponsor considered the following factors, among others: (a) the ratings criteria applicable to your Trust as listed under "Principal Investment Strategy", (b) the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity, (c) the current income provided by the bonds; (d) the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer; (e) the probability of early return of principal or high legal or event risk. After the Date of Deposit, a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the Date of Deposit. Neither event requires elimination of a bond from a Trust but may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to direct the Trustee to dispose of the bond (see "Trust Administration--Portfolio Administration"). In particular, the ratings of the bonds in an Investment Grade Income Trust could fall below "investment grade" (i.e., below "BBB-" or "Baa3") during the Trust's life and the Trust could continue to hold the bonds. See "The Trusts--Risk Factors". Risk Factors. All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can impact the value of bonds in your Trust. You should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the bonds falls, the value of your Units will also fall. You can lose money by investing in a Trust. No one can guarantee that your Trust will achieve its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period. The Information Supplement, which is available upon request, contains a more detailed discussion of risks related to your investment. Current economic conditions. The economic recession in the United States which began in 2007 technically came to an end in June of 2009, however the U.S. and global economies continue to feel the effects of this recessionary period, including increased unemployment and belowaverage levels of economic activity. The U.S. and other foreign governments have taken extraordinary steps to combat the effects of the economic crisis, however the ultimate impact of these measures is unknown and cannot be predicted. In December of 2013, the U.S. Federal9 Reserve announced it would begin tapering its quantitative easing program, however, there continues to be uncertainty concerning potential future changes to the federal funds rate following a period of near zero interest rates over the previous five years. On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Rating Services downgraded the long-term sovereign credit rating of the United States of America to AA+ from AAA, citing the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate. Any substantial change in general market conditions may result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in your Trust's holdings. Market risk is the risk that the value of the bonds in your Trust will fluctuate. This could cause the value of your Units to fall below your original purchase price or below the par value. Market value fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a bond's issuer or insurer, perceptions of the issuer or insurer, or ratings on a bond. Even though the Supervisor supervises your portfolio, you should remember that no one manages your portfolio. Your Trust will not sell a bond solely because the market value falls as is possible in a managed fund. Foreign securities risk. Investing in foreign securities typically involves more risks than investing in securities of United States issuers. These risks can increase the potential for losses in the Trust and affect its Unit price. These risks may include risks such as losses due to political, economic and social developments, international trade conditions, foreign taxes (including withholding taxes), restrictions on foreign investments or exchange of securities, foreign currency fluctuations or restriction on exchange or repatriation of currencies. The political, economic and social structures of some foreign countries may be less stable and more volatile than those in the U.S., and investments in these countries may be subject to the risks of internal and external conflicts, currency devaluations, foreign ownership limitations and tax increases. It is possible that a government may take over the assets or operations of a company or impose restrictions on the exchange or export of currency or other assets. Some countries also may have different legal systems that may make it difficult for the Trust to exercise investor rights, and pursue legal remedies with respect to its foreign investments. Diplomatic and political developments, including rapid and adverse political changes, social instability, regional conflicts, terrorism and war, could affect the economies, industries, and securities and currency markets, and the value of the Trust's investments, in non-u.s. countries. No one can predict the impact that these factors could have on the Trust's portfolio securities. Foreign companies may not be subject to the same disclosure, accounting, auditing and financial reporting standards and practices as U.S. companies. Thus, there may be less information publicly available about foreign companies than about most U.S. companies. Certain foreign securities may be less liquid (harder to sell) and more volatile than many U.S. securities. This means the Trust may at times be unable to sell foreign securities in a timely manner or at favorable prices. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of bonds will fall if interest rates increase. Bonds typically fall in value when interest rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall. Bonds with longer periods before maturity are often more sensitive to interest rate changes. Interest rates in the United States are at or near historic lows, which may increase the Trust's exposure to risks associated with rising interest rates. Credit risk is the risk that a bond's issuer or insurer is unable to meet its obligation to pay principal or interest on the bond. Call risk is the risk that the issuer prepays or "calls" a bond before its stated maturity. An issuer might call a bond if interest rates fall and the bond pays a higher interest rate or if it no longer needs the money for the original purpose. If an issuer calls a bond, your Trust will distribute the principal to you but your future interest distributions will fall. You might not be able to reinvest this principal at as high a yield. A bond's call price could be less than the price your Trust paid for the bond and could be below the bond's par value. This means that you could receive less than the amount you paid for your Units. If enough bonds in your Trust are called, your Trust could terminate early. Some or all of the bonds may also be subject to extraordinary optional or mandatory redemptions if certain events occur, such as certain changes in tax laws, the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used, and various other events. Build America Bonds, Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, in particular, are often subject various to extraordinary or mandatory redemption provisions. See "Taxable Municipal Bonds--Build America Bonds" and "Taxable Municipal Bonds--Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds" below. The call provisions are described in general terms in the "Redemption Feature" column of the "Portfolio" section, and the notes thereto. Bond quality risk is the risk that a bond will fall in value if a rating agency decreases the bond's rating. Bond concentration risk is the risk that your Trust is less diversified because it concentrates in a particular type of bond. When a certain type of bond makes up 25% or more of a Trust, the Trust is considered to be "concentrated" in that bond type. The different bond types are described in the following sections. Reduced diversification risk is the risk that your Trust will become smaller and less diversified as bonds are sold, are called or mature. This could increase your risk of loss and increase your share of Trust expenses. Insurer default risk is the risk that an investor of an insured trust could lose income and/or principal if the issuer and the insurer of a municipal bond both default in making their payment obligations.10 Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a bond will fall if trading in the bond is limited or absent, thereby adversely affecting the Trust's net asset value. No one can guarantee that a liquid trading market will exist for any bond because these bonds generally trade in the over-thecounter market (they are not listed on a securities exchange). Because of the difficulties currently being experienced by many companies in the financial services industry, many markets are experiencing substantially reduced liquidity. As a result of such illiquidity, the Trustee may have to sell other or additional bonds if necessary to satisfy redemption requests. Litigation and legislation risk is the risk that future litigation or legislation could affect the value of your Trust. Litigation could challenge an issuer's authority to issue or make payments on bonds. Taxable Municipal Bonds. Your Trust may invest significantly or exclusively in taxable municipal bonds. States, municipalities and public authorities issue these bonds to raise money for a variety of purposes. In selecting bonds, the Sponsor seeks to diversify your portfolio by bond purpose. This section briefly describes different bond types to help you better understand your investment. The types of bonds in your Trust are listed under "Portfolio". These bonds are also described in greater detail in the Information Supplement. General obligation bonds are backed by the general taxing power of the issuer. The issuer secures these bonds by pledging its faith, credit and unlimited taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. All other municipal bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds. Revenue bonds are payable only from the revenue of a specific project or authority. They are not supported by the issuer's general power to levy taxes. The risk of default in payment of interest or principal increases if the income of the related project falters because that income is the only source of payment. Airport bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate airports. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds primarily depends on the ability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other factors, some airlines may have difficulty meeting these obligations. Bond banks are vehicles that pool various municipal obligations into larger offerings. This reduces the cost of borrowing for the municipalities. The types of financing projects that these obligations support vary. Build America Bonds were issued pursuant to The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "Recovery Act"), authorizing states and local governments to issue taxable bonds and to elect to receive a federal subsidy for a portion of their borrowing costs through a refundable tax credit paid by the United States Treasury Department ("Treasury") and the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), in an amount equal to 35 percent of the total coupon interest payable to investors (45 percent for those Build America Bonds that qualify and are designated as Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds). The Recovery Act adds a new section to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code") which authorizes Build America Bonds that meet the definition of "qualified bonds", as described below, to receive the refundable credit. The Code section defines the term "qualified bond" to mean a Build America Bond (a) issued before January 1, 2011, (b) with 100 percent of the excess of (i) the available project proceeds (as defined to mean sale proceeds of such issue less not more than two percent of such proceeds used to pay issuance costs plus investment proceeds thereon), over (ii) the amounts in a reasonably required reserve fund with respect to such issue, are to be used for capital expenditures, and (c) where the issuer makes an irrevocable election to have this subsection of the Code apply. Should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on the bonds by the Code, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments. In addition, Build America Bonds are often subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to Sections 54AA or 6431 of the Code (as added by the Recovery Act) or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for a portion of a Build America Bond issuer's borrowing costs. Qualified School Construction Bonds, Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds (collectively, "Qualified Bonds") are taxable bonds that are similar to certain Build America Bonds, in that state and municipal Qualified Bond issuers may elect to receive direct interest-subsidy payments from the U.S. Treasury if certain conditions are met. The Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act, enacted into federal law on March 18, 2010, permits issuers of Qualified Bonds to seek applicable subsidies on bond interest payments. Qualified School Construction Bonds, issued pursuant to provisions in the Recovery Act, are issued to finance the construction, rehabilitation, or repair of a public school facility or for the acquisition of land on which such a bond-financed facility will be constructed. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are both issued pursuant to the "Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008", and like Qualified School Construction Bonds, are governed by Section 54A of the Code. Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds are issued for qualified energy conservation purposes, and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds are issued to finance qualified renewable energy facilities that produce electricity. Although the year of issuance is not restricted for Qualified Bonds, federal law provides for limits on the dollar amounts that may be issued for these bond types. Federal legislation has amended the Code in recent years to provide for certain qualifications and restrictions on the issuance of Qualified Bonds, and to include such bonds under the definition of "qualified tax credit bond" as found in Section 54A of the Code. Eligible issuers of Qualified School Construction Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 100% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Eligible issuers of Qualified Energy Conservation Bonds and Clean Renewable Energy Bonds may receive subsidy payments equal to 70% of the lesser of the actual interest rate of the bonds or the tax11 credit rate for municipal tax-credit bonds, set daily by the U.S. Treasury. Should the issuer of a Qualified Bond fail continue to meet the applicable requirements as imposed on any such bond by the Code or other federal laws, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments or even causing mandatory redemption of a portion of the bonds. As provided in Section 54A of the Code, Qualified Bonds are also subject to mandatory redemption of any portion of available project proceeds that remain unexpended by the issuer after three years from the date of issuance. This mandatory redemption must be completed within 90 days after such three-year period, unless an extension is granted by the Treasury. Additionally, Qualified Bonds may be subject to extraordinary redemption in the event that changes to applicable sections of the Code or other federal legislation causes to reduce or eliminate the federal cash subsidy payment for any Qualified Bond issuer's borrowing costs. Certificates of participation are generally a type of municipal lease obligation. Lease payments of a governmental entity secure payments on these bonds. These payments depend on the governmental entity budgeting appropriations for the lease payments. A governmental body cannot obligate future governments to appropriate for or make lease payments, but governments typically promise to take action necessary to include lease payments in their budgets. If a government fails to budget for or make lease payments, sufficient funds may not exist to pay interest or principal on these bonds. Health care bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenue from hospitals and hospital systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on factors such as facility occupancy levels, demand for services, competition resulting from hospital mergers and affiliations, the need to reduce costs, government regulation, costs of malpractice insurance and claims, and government financial assistance (such as Medicare and Medicaid). Higher education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate universities and colleges. These issuers derive revenues from tuition, dormitories, grants and endowments. These issuers face problems related to declines in the number of college-age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees, uncertainty of continued federal grants, state funding or donations, and government legislation or regulation. Industrial revenue bonds finance the cost of acquiring, building or improving industrial projects. Private corporations usually operate these projects. The ability of the issuer to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the creditworthiness of the corporation operating the project, revenues generated by the project, expenses of the project and environmental or other regulatory restrictions. Multi-family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on multiple family residences, retirement housing or housing projects for low to moderate-income families. These bonds are generally prepayable at any time. It is likely that their life will be less than their stated maturity. The ability of these issuers to make payments on bonds depends on such factors as rental income, occupancy levels, operating expenses, mortgage default rates, taxes, government regulations and appropriation of subsidies. Other care bonds include obligations of issuers that derive revenue from mental health facilities, nursing homes and intermediate care facilities. These bonds are similar to health care bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Public building bonds finance the cost of acquiring, leasing, building or improving public buildings such as offices, recreation facilities, convention centers, police stations, correctional institutions and parking garages. The ability of the issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the government budgeting sufficient funds to make lease or mortgage payments on the facility, user fees or rents, costs of maintenance and decreases in use of the facility. Public education bonds are obligations of issuers that operate primary and secondary schools. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends primarily on ad valorem taxes. These issuers may also face problems related to litigation contesting state constitutionality of public education financing. Retail electric/gas/telephone bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from the retail sale of utilities to customers. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on factors such as the rates and demand for these utilities, competition, government regulation and rate approvals, overhead expenses and the cost of fuels. Single family housing bonds are obligations of issuers that derive revenues from mortgage loans on single family residences. Single family residences generally include one to four-family dwellings. These bonds are similar to multi-family housing bonds and the issuers face the same general risks. Tax district bonds are obligations secured by a pledge of taxing power by a municipality, such as tax increment financing or tax allocation bonds. These bonds are similar to general obligation bonds. Unlike general obligation bonds, however, the municipality does not pledge its unlimited taxing power to pay these bonds. Instead, the municipality pledges revenues from a specific tax to pay these bonds. If the tax cannot support payment of interest and principal, a municipality may need to raise the related tax to pay these bonds. An inability to raise the tax could have an adverse effect on these bonds. Transportation bonds are obligations of issuers that own and operate public transit systems, ports, highways, turnpikes, bridges and other transportation systems. The ability of these issuers to make payments on these bonds depends on variations in use, the degree of government subsidization, competition from other forms of transportation and increased costs. Port authorities derive revenues primarily from fees imposed  View more

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.
There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. Certain trusts are unmanaged and their portfolios are not intended to change during the trusts' lives except in limited circumstances. Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.
