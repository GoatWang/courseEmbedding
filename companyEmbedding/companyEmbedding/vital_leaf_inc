What is procollagen?
Procollagen is a Joint Cartilage and Skin Restorer that our 
            body produces until we reach the age of 20 
In other words, Procollagen is a Polypeptide (substance 
from which proteins are made) that our body efficiently 
produces until we reach the age of 20.
After 20 years of age, the Procollagen production decreases 
to such a point that by the time we reach the age of 60, our 
body produces less than 70% of Procollagen needed to feel 
young and healthy.
Procollagen is also responsible for our body's production of 
joint cartilage, collagen and elastic fibers that allows our 
skin to stretch. 
            
        

                            Procollagen deficiency contributes in the appearance of 
joint and back pain as well as wrinkles, bags under eyes 
and more

Differences between Procollagen and hydrolyzed collagen
Collagen must be regenerated by our own bodies instead of 
been ingested. Taking hydrolyzed collagen with the main 
objective of deriving benefits is a myth. Our body produces 
collagen from Procollagen as shown below:
Contrary to popular beliefs, our body cannot produce 
collagen from a hydrolyzed collagen based supplement. If this 
were true, heart pills would be available to regenerate our 
heart and, obviously, that is not the case!
Finally, we do not eat a cow's heart to regenerate our heart 
because we know that eating any animal organ such as a 
heart, collagen or kidney, will not regenerate the organ in our 
body.  
In order to recover collagen, joint cartilage and elastic fibers 
that stretch our skin, it is necessary to take Vital 
ProcollagenÂ®; in doing so, our joints will strengthen and our 
skin will rejuvenate. 
                  


Procollagen Deficiency in the Circulatory System may cause:

Bad circulation accompanied by numbness and  tingling sensation in hands and feet.
Appearance of varicose or spider veins. 
Memory loss and sleep disorders. 
High blood pressure.
Arterioesclerosis.

REDUCTION OF WRINKLES, STRETCH MARKS AND CELLULITE






INCREASE ENERGY AND SEXUAL DRIVE. . ,






                   The cartilage in our joints is made of Procollagen. When there is 
insufficient Procollagen, our body is unable to produce enough joint 
cartilage which is the leading factor that causes joint and back pain. 
                

                    Notably, the elastic fibers that stretch our skin are also made of 
Procollagen. When its production decreases, wrinkles, bags under 
eyes and flaccidity appear. Let's not forget that the production of 
Procollagen decreases by the time we reach the age of 20.

Vital Group (VG)
Vital Group (VG), as a business, is a unique blend of Asian values and
                    global standards of quality. A strong people (relationship) orientation coupled with
                    professional integrity and highest level of commitment to delivering quality in all our
                    products and services – this unique combination has lent VG a special recognition and
                    acknowledgement both in the business community and society at large. This business
                    philosophy of VG is reflected in all our interactions and transactions, inland and outland.
Business, for VG, is primarily a Social Enterprise. The very reason why VG came into
                    being was to respond to the society’s needs to have access to quality products. Quality
                    is our main product and Trust is our earning. Quality is what we sell and Trust is what we earn.
The Vital Group started its operations in 1991 with the launch of VITAL
                    TEA – which has now become the choice of every third person who drinks tea in
                    Pakistan. With its passion to serve and due to the high demand from its customers and
                    buyers, VG has now also launched other personal care items, such as VITAL BEAUTY SOAP.

Vital Tea
Vital Tea is VG very first product which was launched at a small town in Punjab,
                    ‘Haroonabad’. Within a very short span of time, we started selling it across the country
                    and to a larger market outside Pakistan also. Vital Tea’s export started since 2005. The
                    tea is now available in different flavours.
Vital Tea leafs are hand-picked in the mountains of Kenya. To capture the aroma of the
                    tea, these leafs are, then, processed on the same day and shipped to our facility in
                    Pakistan. Our Master Chef blends the mixture for a rich colour and taste that touches
                    the hearts through taste buds. Every cup of Vital Tea provides a hot and refreshing
                    blend of perfect aroma, colour, and taste that serves your taste buds well.
Try once and you will agree with our description!
Due to high demand of our customers, green tea product will also be available in the
                    local and global market.

Vital Beauty Soap Range
Vital Revitalizing Beauty Soap was launched in 2013 since then the Vital Group has introduced Ocean Fresh, Lemon & Tea Extract & Chiffon Feel for its customers, Its fruity range is the latest addition to the Vital
                    Family. Its design, texture and fragrance is such that it has created a higher demand for local & export.
Vital Revitalizing Beauty Soap is a Certified HALAL SOAP. Its revitalizing moisturizer
                    cleans your skin and makes your skin look soft, healthy and glowing with a superb fragrance.
