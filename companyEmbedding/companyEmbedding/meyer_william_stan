Ingredient Glossary
 
We are proud of the ingredients in our products and list them on every label, as well as share additional information below. Our products are specifically formulated to be safe for use in and around the home with family, children and pets. We work hard to ensure our products have the very best combination of ingredients—combinations that not only work hard on your daily dirt and grime, but that fill your home with garden-inspired scents.
We make intelligent, responsible raw material choices, and whenever possible, obtain materials from renewable plant resources such as coconut, corn, soy or olive. At times we choose not to use a plant-derived material for reasons of efficacy, consistency and safety.
Our products do not contain ammonia, chlorine, glycol solvents, parabens, phthalates, formaldehyde, artificial colorants, phosphates or petroleum distillates.
We do not test our products on animals, nor are our products made with animal-derived ingredients.
Our packaging is recyclable and we use at least 25% post-consumer plastic in our bottles.
We manufacture according to exacting personal care standards in a cosmetic-grade cGMP facility. cGMP is an abbreviation for the term "current Good Manufacturing Practice", which refers to FDA regulations regarding the manufacturing, testing, and quality control of pharmaceutical and food products.
All suppliers of Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day ingredients derived from Palm Oil are members of RSPO (Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil). Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day supports sustainable practices of eco-sensitive areas throughout Asia, Africa and South America like the Brazilian rain forests.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

William Stanley Jr.
Pioneer of the transformer and alternating current (AC) distribution


William Stanley (1858-1916) was an inventor and engineer. He developed the first practical transformer 
		(which spurred the development of AC power) as well as other developments; 
		like an improved electric meter and the first metal thermos bottle (vacuum flask). He lived most 
		of his life and ran his businesses in Western Massachusetts during the golden age of electric development.
		
Stanley is one of the most important inventors of AC power, his work puts him on a par with Edison, Westinghouse, Tesla,
		Elihu Thomson, Charles Brush and other major personalities of the time. Like the other great pioneers of the time he 
		loved to tinker and design, held 
		a disdain for legal quagmires of patent proceedings, and had his own set of friends and rivals in the industry.
		

"Stanley made transformers practical in the way that Edison made the light bulb practical" - Tom Blalock, Historian. 2014
		
Life and contributions
		Born in Brooklyn, New York, William Stanley attended private schools
		before enrolling at Yale University. He began to study law at age 21
		but less than a semester later left school to look for a job in the
		emerging field of electricity. The decision marked the beginning of a
		productive career whose highlights included the invention of the modern
		type of transformer, and the creation of the business enterprise that
		was to become General Electric's Pittsfield Works. 
		
Stanley's first job was as an electrician with one of the early
		manufacturers of telegraph keys and fire alarms. He then worked in a
		metal-plating establishment before joining Hiram Maxim, inventor of the
		machine gun and already a pioneer in the electrical industry. As
		Maxim's assistant, Stanley directed one of the country's first
		electrical installations, in a store on New York's Fifth Avenue.
		
1883 - Stanley was inspired by Charles F. Brush's work on batteries which involved 
		study of electromotive force. Stanley developed AC power circuit designs in his notebooks but didn't
		yet have a chance to build prototypes. This laid the foundation for his understanding of 
		electromagnetics - the basis of AC circuits and apparatus.
		
Stanley later wrote of that time:
		"I foresaw at that time, dimly, to be sure, but still with suffient accuracy to realisze soemthing of its value, that
		alternating currents could be used to produce and electromotive force upon the circuit to be regulated,
		in place of the battery electromotive forces suggested by Brush and the resistance electromotive forces
		 of Weston and Thomson. I do not mean to imitate that at that time I had complete knowledge of the invention
		 - that came later - but that it was the starting point from which I worked until,
		 in 1885, the completed system was developed."

Stanley said that in the period prior to industry successes in 1885 it took "definite 
		 self-conviction" to keep working on AC power which was experiencing many setbacks in
		 experiements. There were no useful books on the technology and he refers to AC power as a
		 "despised and rejected line of work".
		 
1884 - Stanley moves to Pittsburgh to work with Westinghouse. He worked on solving
		 problems in AC distribution but had no alternator to work with. He "wasted" a great deal
		 of time trying to convert DC to AC power for experiments.
		 

1885
		
		 - Inventor and industrialist 
      George Westinghouse learned of Stanley's
	accomplishments and promoted him as chief engineer at his Pittsburgh
	facility.  It was during this time that an AC transformer was developed
	by Frenchman Lucien Gaulard and Englishman John Gibbs.In the spring Stanley goes to George Westinghouse 
		and asks him to order a Siemens generator and Gaulard and Gibbs transformers from Europe. Stanley
		believes that the Gaulard and Gibbs Transformer is not commercially useful. He believed he could
		solve the problems in the existing system by having the transformer have each coil
		operate independently of the others in circuit and have it be self-regulating, both
		in electromotive force, and in terms of current transformed.
		
		
		





       George Westinghouse Jr.



Westinghouse instructed
	Stanley and his assistants, Albert Schmid and Oliver B. Shallenberger, to make tests to
	determine the commercial value of the Gaulard and Gibbs system. He also
	arranged to have a number of the transformers and a Siemens
	alternating-current generator forwarded from England to Pittsburgh.
	
Stanley, working under the direction of Westinghouse, devised a further
	improvement, which consisted in securing the enclosure of the coils by
	making the core of E-shaped plates,
	the central projections of each
	successive plate being alternately inserted through rewound coils from
	opposite sides, thus permitting separate winding and consequently the
	better insulation of the coils.




		  This form was further improved by
		Albert Schmid, who extended the
		ends of the arms of the E to meet the
		central projection. When inserting these plates the extensions were
		temporarily bent upward, and upon being released each plate formed a
		closed magnetic circuit about the sides of the coils. Schmid was a Swiss mechanical engineer 
		working for Westinghouse who had worked on some 
		of the earliest dynamos and arc lamp systems in Europe.



Above
		and below: Stanley's 1885 prototype transformer at the Berkshire Museum.



 William Stanley, Albert Schmid is
		equipped with knowledge of the European
		advancements and then develops the first reliable transformer - it uses a
		soft iron core and adjustable gaps to regulate the amount of
		Electromagnetic Field in the secondary winding.


 Stanley quickly became unhappy with the Siemens generator which he was provided with
		Starting on November 5th, 1885 he developed his own radial pole type alternator and sent
		the drawings to Pittsburgh. 
		
		
		
		
The move from the 'Sooty City'
In 1885, ill health almost cut short his career - some say he worked
		himself too hard. Stanley had been working in Pittsburgh which was Andrew Carnegie's steel 
		town and had the worst air quality in the US, it was also known as "Sooty City", and this contributed
		to William Stanley's poor health. The move away proved a disguised blessing, because it
		necessitated a move to his family home, Great Barrington,
		Massachusetts. In those peaceful surroundings, he was able to develop
		some ideas he had suggested two years earlier to his employer, George
		Westinghouse (who helped finance Stanley's lab) for a new type of
		transformer. 



One of 19 transformers
		used in the Great Barrington installation. 1886.


		This work resulted, on March 20, 1886, in the demonstration of a
		prototype system of high voltage transmission employing Stanley's
		parallel connected transformer. This system was used by him to provide
		lighting for offices and stores on the town's Main Street. Read more
		about it in the link below:

distribution system in the world!

Stanley received a patent on his transformer: "Induction-Coil," Patent
No. 349,611.

		William Stanley explains to Franklin L. Pope (adviser to Westinghouse
		and patent lawyer.) that is design was salable and a great improvement.
		Pope disagrees but Westinghouse decides to trust Stanley anyway. 

		These various inventions and discoveries led up within a year to
		commercial production of transformers of high efficiency and excellent
		regulating qualities.

		The development was a fine engineering performance in speed and in
		quality. The most important single contribution was by Stanley. He
		brought out the parallel connection in which the transformers are
		connected in parallel, across the constant-potential
		alternating-current system, instead of being arranged in series, as in
		the Gaulard and Gibbs connection. He obtained patents on the method,
		involving the construction of transformers in which the counter
		electromotive force generated in the primary coil of the transformer
		was practically equal to the electromotive force of the supply circuit.
		This is obvious now, but in 1886, when the principles and
		characteristics of the alternating current were practically unknown, it
		was a wonderful invention, and revolutionary in character. On this
		invention Stanley's fame largely rests. Of course Stanley did not
		discover or invent a theory of counter electromotive force before any
		one else had thought of it. Such fundamental things seldom happen in
		invention. His claim to great and original merit rests on the discovery
		of a theory which was new to him and the use of it in making a
		structure of immense importance in the affairs of men. Briefly, all
		transformers now made are built upon practically the same principles as
		those that were developed in these early products of the Westinghouse
		Company.

Westinghouse's dysfunctional "team"
		In the 1880s and early 90s George Westinghouse had a team of some of
		the best engineers in the world: William Stanley, Louis Stillwell,
		Albert Schmid, Benjamin Lamme, Oliver Shallenberger and Nikola Tesla.
		Meanwhile JP Morgan was gathering together the best engineers he could
		find in the AC field, people like Charles E.L. Brown who was one of the
		earliest proponents of polyphase AC power. Westinghouse had a clear
		advantage controlling much of the patents in the world's most lucrative
		market(North America). However, underneath this appearance of success
		was a pile of eccentric and oddball personalities. Shallenberger and
		Stillwell worked together well, but Stanley had differences with some,
		and Tesla had trouble working with any of them. Whether it was egos,
		corporate environment or simple anti-social behavior found in geniuses,
		the eventual result was inventors breaking off to do their own thing
		while they tried to make as much as possible off of royalties. 
Souring relations

"We will ruin you!" - unknown person at Westinghouse Electric

		George Westinghouse came up to see the working system at Great
		Barrington with his entourage and was pleased but with time
		things began to sour between William Stanley and Westinghouse.
		Eventually Stanley had a falling out with George over
		money. It was said that
		Westinghouse's lawyer Franklin Pope convinced Westinghouse to drop Stanley's 
		business. Ironically Pope later was killed by one of Stanley's
		transformers while checking on it in his basement in Great Barrington. 

		Stanley had ambitions of creating his own electric company on a scale to compete with Thomson-Houston, Edison, and Westinghouse.
		He was not deterred by a threat from someone at Westinghouse that if he left "We will ruin you!".
		He set up shop in nearby Pittsfield, MA. Stanley produced high quality large transformers with the help of Cummings C. Chesney 
		and John Forrest Kelly to product the SKC line of transformers.
		After becoming disillusioned with the electrical business due to the drawn out patent fights he sold 
		to the Roeblings Family. Stanley lost control of his company and it became part of General Electric.
		Chesney moved to Schenectady to continue his work while Kelly (who was a bit of a loner) preferred to work on his own.
		SKC transformers from Stanley's independent years continued to be in use over 100 years later in places like Middle Falls, NY.





 General Electric years

		Stanley's genius continued to influence the industry as he produced
		newer and better power distribution systems for General Electric. The
		Stanley Works in Pittsfield, MA develops new power distribution systems
		at the birth of the power grid. Stanley's air blast transformers are
		used in the Folsom Powerhouse in 1895 and other GE AC power systems. Stanley's genius was employed in the making of
		distribution systems for AC power at Niagara Falls in a project which divided the job between Westinghouse and GE. 


The Stanley Works in Pittsfield, MA

		Stanley grew tired of the long legal battles required to protect
		patents. As an engineer he found these proceedings draining
		and frustrating. He spent the later years of his life (1900-1916)
		experimenting with other technologies. He developed a better thermos
		among other things.
		At times he attended honor ceremonies and photo shoots at General
		Electric for his lifetime of achievement, but he had already disengaged
		from
		the major transformer works in Pittsfield in his final years.
		
The legacy of Stanley's transformer works lived on in Pittsfield,
		MA until 1986 when GE closed the plant. At the time they had been
		producing
		some of the largest transformers in the world for clients around the
		planet. The works were profitable but were closed anyway as part of
		GE's restructuring. GE gave Westinghouse's transformer operation all
		100 years of technology. Westinghouse's operation was in Indiana and
		some of the workers moved there, but that was shut down a year later.
		Today the only major transformer manufacturing operation still left in
		the US is Niagara Transformer Corporation.
 
		

		We recommend you visit the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, MA to learn
		more about Stanley.

A video clip of "It Runs on Water"
                    the Equinox TV program
                    from the UK, 1995, featuring Stanley. 



Stan Meyer's Dune Buggy that ran on water. Hydrogen/Oxygen fuel in an ICE motor. On board electrolysis, no hydrogen tanks, no bombs on-board, just water. (1998) It ran 100 miles per gallon! The 2nd best inventor of the Century, besides Tesla, who was and will always be #1. Stan is the mustard seed of Water Powered Cars! The video left above is a one timed aired news cast, from his home town of Grove City , Ohio that you are not to view. The video screen to the right is a segment of the Equinox program about Stanley aired back in Dec. 1995 (approx.) See the entire program entitled "It Runs on Water" narrated by Arthur C. Clarke in video clips  below.
              It is in 4 parts, made possible by Andy the WizardKing from Blackpool, England.
(9/2014 update) Stan's dune buggy is in Canada, it was bought off the Holbrook family for a down payment and royalty of the duplicating was to follow, but was taken to Canada, so the corp. would not have to ay any more money. Stephen Meyer is alive and knew as much as Stan did. An eye witness to the dune buggy sale said the VW engine ran beautifully, they did NOT run it for many buyers. They told most buyers it did not run. It was stored in a 2 story building, with no doors, sealed in a room so no ne could steal it! Stan's last experiment with that same buggy was running the engine on charged water from his resonant chamber powered by his VIC circuit. Instead of gas into the carb., it ran charged water, much like what Steve Ryan from NZ did with is HHO running motorcycle. The VW engine had to be cleaned out with light oil, as to not damage the engine, as the charged deuterium level water put out NH3 fumes (ammonia) from the burning H3 and nitrogen from the air had a reaction to produce a putrid smell of ammonia, the only draw back. Though ran well and the timing was set right. NO GASOLINE, just water. You can see why Stan was taken out, he threatened the National Security of the Jesuit leaders and would destroy the Oil Corp Petrol Dollar empire. 
Download Stan's out of print book : "The Birth of a New Technology" , 222 pages is ready for you to download in a .pdf file. 9/2014  "Someday ENERGY will be FREE to all inhabitants of the Earth" Bro Andrew ( the Holy Spirit told me this info.) That is the goal of WaterPoweredCar Inc. 

Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4
 DOWNLOAD the lastest .pdf of how he did it. (4/2010)

                  He was a shame to hear that he was poisoned (March 98') and longer with us. He died in the parking lot of a restaurant in his home town of Grove City, Ohio. Sharks came a week later and stole the the dune buggy and all of his experimental equipment, according to his brother, Steve. Stan said while he was alive, that he was threatened many times and would not sell out to Arab Oil Corp.s The dune buggy was later found and NOT stolen, the Holbrook family, hid it away in their garage. The Holbrooks were partners and friends of Stan. We hear Stephen Meyers knows as much as Stan does, but is afraid and says nothing. He is working with HHO boosting with semi trucks, last info., that we received. The Military was going to use this technology in their tanks, jeeps, etc. He had patents on his invention and was ready for production. Only $1,500 to equip your car!  See the Videos above. No gasoline, just water. Stanley said he was offered a billion dollars from an Arab to basically shelf his idea. Stan said, "no, this technology is for the people." Who you suppose poisoned Stan? A jealous onlooker? Do you think the Oil Corp.'s are happy to see a converted car running for FREE?? Our own US DOE, and the present administration are heavily involved in the Oil business. If GW wanted my respect,I'd have inventors like Stan on TV and with me in the White House, discussing how to save this dying planet and break the bonds of ruled  corruption and greed. I have read the DOE's hydrogen & fuel cell technology and they don't mention making hydrogen from pure water, until the last page. They rather get hydrogen from hydrocarbons. They don't mention "On Board Hydrogen Electrolysis" make the egas as you go. They talk about Hydrogen Gas Stations at how much per gallon? In the mean time, make sure the auto parts like your air filter, spark plugs and tune up items to make your car as fuel efficient as possible are up to date. 
So what is happening with Stan's Great Invention of the 20th Century!! Absolutely nothing. Are they manufacturing his invention. NO, Why not? because it would solve all the world's problems today. That is NOT how politics work, MONEY is the ruler here. Common Sense is NOT for humans, only good for OUTLAWS & so called terrorists.? Huh? We live in a time when good is spoken of as evil and evil spoken up as good. Why do I say that because it is true. We were told the US twin towers was taken down by airplanes, when the truth is, it was taken down by C4 explosives. William Rodriguez holds the master key, he was there that day, he lost his job and 250 of his friends and colleges. Connect the dots, it is that simple. Sorry to have shocked you and made your face turn red, but Building #7 came down in 7 seconds, not reported in the 911 commission report. No planes hit that building, only a few office fires happened. It was all too fishy from me, and continues to stink like a dead rat.
All they talk about is hydrogen gas stations run by Shell and a Canadian Oil Firm. Then they talk all about "hydrogen fuel cells" which take a lifetime of gas burned just to make one fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell factory is a real SMOG factory. To explain better read on. There Fuel Cells are not as efficient as a "On board Hydrogen Electrolysis" fuel cell. Stan made the gas as he drove, no hydrogen tanks, no fuel cells, no need for Shell Hydrogen Stations. He spent 30 years of research all on his own.
GOOD NEWS! Stephen Meyer, Stan's twin brother lives! He is into the same 
  technology! He stays low key, because he wants to live.

 Recent Harassment on a Stan Meyer Cell Builder in India 2-1-07
              We are familiar with the suppression of free-energy devices. In the USA there have been literally thousands of cases - for example, Bill Williams for running his truck on a Joe Cell, T Henry Moray for pulling kilowatts out of the environment and Ed Gray for daring to have a power tube with an output power 100 times the input power.

                In Australia there is intense opposition to anyone using the Nitro Cell on any engine. In New Zealand, to the magnetic motor of Robert Adams which is 700% efficient. In the UK, to devices for water-splitting and permanent magnet motors. In Japan to Teruo Kawai’s patented magnetic motor which is 160% efficient.

                But in the last week there has been an instance of it in India, in spite of the fact that the bus service in Mumbai has been run on hydrogen for some years now. A man, who wishes to remain anonymous in order not to aggravate the current situation, has just been picked on. He has been running a business for the last 23 years and has a good relationship with his local Commercial Taxation Office staff.

                He became interested in Dave Lawton’s replication and decided to try it for himself. The seven pictures which I have placed in the Files section of the Group in the folder “RAVZZ” show his high standard of workmanship. He encountered a minor problem with his implementation of the electronic driving circuit, and so contacted Dave Lawton for technical advice. This was given and the problem solved. He then e-mailed Dave some pictures showing his progress.

                Within 8 hours, his premises were raided by nine people supposedly from the local Tax Office. In actual fact, six of them were from the local office and the other three were unknown to the locals who had been ordered to take them along. During their search of the place, the man was told that he would be well advised to discontinue all work connected to hydrogen. That shows clearly that the “raid” had nothing whatsoever to do with taxation and the Tax Office was just being used as an excuse to invade the privacy of an individual.

                They spent six hours checking everything eventually left, taking commercial records with them, and subsequently requested that our friend attend their local office on Wednesday (the day before yesterday). He attended, sensibly taking people from his business as witnesses. The six local officials were there and they returned the records taken, stating that there was nothing wrong with the records or the tax position. They also said that they were bewildered by the whole affair. He asked them about the other three men, and they said that the Commissioners office had asked them to take them along....and they have no idea who they were!

                He then had a long conversation with the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer who had came over to his place. He also seemed confused as to why they were hurried up to go over to his place from the Commissioners office. He said that the Commissioners office received a complaint from some higher authorities and these people were given written instructions (an unusual thing in itself) to go to his office and make some checks, usually this happens but the visits are done after 3-4 days of the receipt of the letter from the Commissioners office based on the time allotment, but in this case there were 4 calls directly from the Commissioners office to go over to his place immediately !!

                This is a typical case of deliberate intimidation and it is unusual only because it is in India. It also shows that Dave Lawton’s e-mails are being intercepted and read as this man did not mention his hydrogen work to anyone else. Dave once made the mistake of applying for a development grant from his Local Authority. The grant was to help develop one of his inventions. He was visited by two unpleasant individuals who took away his written proposal. Nothing ever came of it and when Dave asked for his documents back, they lied, saying that they has posted them. When he pressured them, they did eventually send the documents back, and the date stamp on the envelope shows that the documents were posted long after they originally claimed that they had been sent. It turns out that these men have no connection with the Local Authority Grants section and it seems clear that they fall into the same category as the three “unknown” men in India who carried out the raid. 
                presumably, Dave’s phone calls and e-mails have been intercepted and monitored ever since and that is what triggered the raid in India.

                The raid in India is very interesting in that it shows clearly that the opposition are very much afraid of Stan Meyer’s Water Fuel Cell. This implies that the cell is capable of producing serious amounts of free-energy and can break our dependency on fossil fuels.

Stanley Meyer, Water-Fuel Cell Inventor & Promoter, Dies Suddenly
by Dr. Gene Mallove (another inventor who was murdered.) 
Stanley A. Meyer, the controversial Ohio inventor who had claimed his technology could produce a hydrogen-oxygen mixture with a minimal energy input (compared with conventional electrolysis) died on March 21, 1998. He did not have a world-wide following, like he should have, few people have heard of him. 
There were also those of adherents and people who had invested in his activities --- Water Fuel Cell (Grove City, OH). He was famous for his claimed "water fueled car" which was exhibited symbolically in the BBC/CBC 1994 documentary on cold fusion, "Too Close to the Sun". We were initially curious about Meyer's work,  the late Christopher Tinsley of the UK, and the late Admiral of the British Navy, Sir Anthony Griffin, but who became frustrated by being unable --- or, more to the point, not allowed --- to confirm (or reject) Meyer's claims.
It makes no sense that after discovering the technological process that  he had. Why there is no way that a reasonable, straightforward marketing strategy would have failed to make his technology quickly spread worldwide. He could have become very influential and very rich.
There remains a very strong suspicion that he had no such process, from his enemies, (Oil Corp. Cartels) even though he conducted a demonstration (before this writer and another engineer at the Meyer lab in 1993) of the production of copious hydrogen/oxygen gas from what visually seemed like a small input power. But Meyer was exceedingly paranoid and he flatly refused reasonable requests by us and others to test the performance --- the input/out power ratio, even with the proviso that we did not have to "look into his black box" of electronics feeding his rather simply constructed stainless steel electrode, alternating current and voltage cell. The last such refusal --- this one in public and recorded on video tape --- was at the ANE meeting in Denver CO in 1997. Then Meyer loudly and falsely protested  that he would "lose his patent rights" if he were to release anything but complete, integrated systems --- such as a water-fueled vehicle. 
In 1996, Meyer lost a long-lasting Ohio civil court battle accusing him of "egregious fraud" against a former associate.  Meyer's said, he ascribed this and other alleged assaults on him to various conspiracies against water as a fuel. He was offered huge sums of money (a billion dollars) to "suppress this technology", but that he had refused those sums. One had the impression that he really believed that there were conspiracies against him. These conspiracies exist today. That is a tragedy, a very compounded tragedy if he had actually come up with something novel and useful that he was hiding.
This is a very complex human and scientific story that we shall want to cover in greater detail in a future issue of infinite energy. There are other processes and inventions that suggest that splitting water molecules with much greater efficiency than with conventional electrolysis is possible. Certainly there are other novelties within water --- "cold fusion" to be sure --- that really do produce prodigious quantities of energy,  in the mode Meyer claimed. For now, here are some of the facts surrounding Meyer's death:
He was apparently eating dinner at a Grove City OH restaurant, when it is reported that he jumped up from the table, yelled that he'd been poisoned", and rushed out into the parking lot, where he collapsed and died. It has been reported by Meyer's associates that Meyer had just secured funding for a $50 million research center near Grove City, but there is no way to confirm or reject this at the moment.
Conclusion : Stanley is gone and we continue to buy gasoline and we continue to create global warming at a alarming rate and no one does nothing.

A better way to clean
inspired by a mother of nine.





How We Began
Learn what sparked the creation of ourhard-working, nice smelling product line.

Our products were inspired by Mrs. Thelma A. Meyer, an Iowa homemaker and mother of nine. It all started when one of her daughters was walking down a cleaning aisle, eyeing all the products with their harsh, stinky chemicals. Right then and there, she had an idea: "Let's make cleaners that smell nice, like my mom's garden, but still work like the dickens on daily dirt and grime."




WHAT WE MAKE
Find out how and why our products smell like a garden, yet clean like the dickens.

For generations we've had to put up with harsh chemical smells to get a good clean. Enter Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day. A collection of household products made with essential oils from flowers and herbs that smell nice, but really pack a punch against daily dirt and grime. Our garden fresh scents include Lavender, Lemon Verbena, Basil, Geranium and many others.






"I wouldn't put my name on something that didn't work hard and smell great. No reason to ruin my reputation this late in the game."

We put a lot of work into our products so it's less work for our consumers.
