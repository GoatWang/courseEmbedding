Investment Process








Fundamental Macro Factors
Our Investment Process is a discipline which employs a "top down/funnel approach," first analyzing fundamental macro factors then assessing their impact on economies, financial markets and the investment climate.
Strategic Macro Overview

Our Strategic Macro Overview is the fundamental framework within which we apply our financial, technical and investment analysis.
Technical Financial Market Forces
We analyze historical trends, charts and data in order to arrive at a synopsis of market conditions and attractive sectors.
Fundamental Investment Research
For small and mid-cap companies we do our own due diligence. With mega-cap companies we supplement our internal research with external "street" research.
Character of management is critical. We analyze their commitment, integrity, level of competence, experience and comprehension in running a public company.
We emphasize total rate of return as the means to preserve and increase client wealth.
Asset Allocation and Portfolio Construction
This is the end result of our funnel approach. We are seeking the optimum balance between risk and return for the client.

Zacks Investment Research upgraded shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a sell rating to a hold rating in a research report report published on Tuesday morning. The brokerage currently has $38.00 target price on the technology company’s stock. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”
Several other research analysts have also issued reports on CA. Citigroup Inc.  restated a neutral rating and set a $34.00 price target (up previously from $33.00) on shares of CA in a report on Sunday, May 14th. Jefferies Group LLC  restated a buy rating and set a $38.00 price target on shares of CA in a report on Sunday, May 14th. Raymond James Financial, Inc. upgraded shares of CA from a market perform rating to an outperform rating and set a $42.00 price target for the company in a report on Monday, May 8th. Piper Jaffray Companies raised their price target on shares of CA from $42.00 to $45.00 and gave the stock an overweight rating in a report on Monday, April 17th. Finally, DA Davidson lowered shares of CA from a buy rating to a neutral rating in a report on Monday, April 10th. Four equities research analysts have rated the stock with a sell rating, eight have assigned  a hold rating and five have issued  a buy rating to the stock. The stock currently has an average rating of Hold and an average price target of $35.10.

CA has a 52-week low of $30.01 and a 52-week high of $36.54. 
CA (NASDAQ:CA) last released its quarterly earnings results on Thursday, May 11th.
