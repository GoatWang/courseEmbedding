Great teaching tool for savings and investing

    I am so happy I found Stockpile. I was looking for a "live but relatively small money" way to get my kids in a path to savings and investing. This has been perfect. My 16 year old daughters love it, are interested in it, ask a lot of questions and then buy stocks in companies they know.  And the customer service is wonderful. The 3-4 times I've emailed with questions or suggestions have been met with very prompt replies.  Overall it is really tremendous and I highly recommend it.

    Stockpile is real easy to use and pretty simple. Definitely for beginners in trade. I seem to have trouble logging in with Touch ID sometimes.
