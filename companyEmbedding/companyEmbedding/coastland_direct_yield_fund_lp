2016 was a year of surprises (tumultuous start, etc).  What most surprised you about 2016 and what developments of 2016 do you believe have had the biggest impact on shaping our industry ?
Which sectors of alt lending have had the most dramatic change (growth and/or decline) across P2P, SMB, Real Estate, other
The Customer:  Are alternative lenders fundamentally using new technology and data to transform how service is delivered to the customer, or, are they just originating loans differently.  Which lenders and sectors have fundamentally transformed the customer experience?  Do you think this innovation in customer experience is here to stay/what will it take for it to become mainstream?
Economy:  What is the broader impact of Alt Lending on the economy – is it opening up access to funding to more people, other impact?
Traditional FI/Banks:   Partnerships between fin tech & banks has been the big buzz word of 2016.  Who is doing this right and do any of them really have traction or is this just about PR?
What are your predictions for 2017?

Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The Direct Lending Income Fund (DLIF) is a private credit strategy that evaluates and purchases short-duration small business loans ranging from $10k-$250k. DLIF targets a net annualized unlevered return of 10-13%. There is no lock up and 35 day liquidity is offered with the option to receive monthly interest income (approx. 1% per month). 

Thanks to a fifteen year decline in bank small business lending, small businesses significantly overpay for credit. Loans to these businesses deliver high current income and substantial downside protection. DLIF buys and holds a pool of these cash-flow rich loans in a simple, transparent investment vehicle.

DLIF purchases loans directly from non-bank business lending platforms, with whom it has negotiated long-term loan acquisition and servicing relationships. Once a loan is originated, DLIF evaluates the loan and purchases it into the portfolio. Loans range from six to eighteen months in duration, and borrowers pay principal and income daily or weekly via direct debt from their bank account.

Typical borrowers are small businesses of $500k - $5 million in revenue that have been in business for over 10 years. The business owner typically has a prime credit rating and offers a personal guarantee on the loan. The current portfolio consists of ~2,000 loans, which are geographically and industry diversified (e.g. doctor offices, retail stores, hotels, restaurants).

Because small businesses overpay for credit, spreads are wide enough to protect investor principal and mitigate risk. Defaults of 22% could be sustained without adversely affecting investor principal. Actual default rates have been 6-7% allowing the fund to meet the targeted return of 10-13% annually. DLIF has had positive returns on a monthly basis since inception. The goal of the fund is to continue to return approximately 1% per month and mitigate risk by maintaining a diversified pool of loans.
