History[edit]
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company opened in 1887 with the production of kraft paper, also known as Kraft, and blotting paper.
In 1921, a team of chemists performing research for General Motors discovered tetraethyllead (TEL) had antiknock properties as a gasoline additive. As a result, the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation in Richmond, Virginia began production of tetraethyllead in 1937. TEL remained the primary product of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation through the next four decades. When the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation expanded its product line (particularly to include MMT), its name was changed to the Ethyl Corporation.
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company borrowed $200 million in 1962 and purchased Ethyl Corporation, a company more than thirteen times its size.
Throughout the next few decades, The Ethyl Corporation, under the direction of the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, further expanded their product line to include bromine (in 1969 in Magnolia, Arkansas), lubricant additives (in 1975), and aluminum alkyls (in 1976 in Feluy, Belgium). Further expansion of The Ethyl Corporation included the purchases of Dow Chemical's bromine division, Russ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Potasse et Produits Chimiques (PPC).
In February 1994, Ethyl spun off its chemical businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation.[4] Albemarle was headquartered in Richmond, VA, until 2008 when it announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to Baton Rouge, LA.[5] In 2015 the company announced the relocation of its headquarters from Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Charlotte, North Carolina.[6]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Albemarle Corporation shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Franklin resources and others[7])
Expansion[edit]




Albemarle facility located in Amsterdam.


In July 1994, The Albemarle Corporation expanded itself by acquiring the Asano Corporation,[4] a sales and marketing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The corporation sold both its electronic materials business and its alpha olefins, polyalphaolefins and synthetic alcohols businesses by 1996, and in 1997 formed an alliance with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. That same year, the corporation was restructured to form two global business units: Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals.
In 1998, the Albemarle Corporation bought a custom manufacturing and oilfield chemicals plant in Teesport, England.[8] In the same year, a joint venture was signed between Jordan Dead Sea Industries Company, Arab Potash Company, and one of Albemarle Corporation's subsidiaries.[8] Another joint venture was signed in 2000 by the corporation and Jinhai Chemical and Industry Company, located in China.[9] More chemical plants were opened within the next five years in Port-de-Bouc, France and Bergheim, Germany (after the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH).[10]
Since 2000, Albemarle Corporation has acquired assets of Ferro Corporation's PYRO-CHEK flame retardant business; Martinswerk GmbH; the custom and fine chemicals businesses of ChemFirst Inc.; the Ethyl Corporation's fuel and lubricant antioxidants business; the phosphorus-based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of Rhodia; Atofina S.A.'s (Paris) bromine fine chemicals business; Taerim International Corporation, and the refinery catalyst business of Akzo Nobel N.V.[10]
Also in 2000, Albemarle Corporation, Cytec Industries Inc., and GE Specialty Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Company, announced their intention to form a new business-to-business internet joint venture, PolymerAdditives.com. The creation of this venture was intended to help provide materials faster and more efficiently directly from trusted suppliers.[9]
In the years following, Albemarle acquired its refinery catalysts platform from Akzo Nobel N.V. in 2004 with sites and/or joint ventures in the Netherlands, Houston, France, Brazil, Japan and Singapore.[5] In partnership with UOP, Albemarle created the Hydroprocessing Alliance in 2006 to deliver integrated refinery solutions and hydroprocessing technologies and catalysts to the refining industry.[11]
Albemarle continued its international expansion in 2007, opening a new regional sales office in Dubai to meet growing market needs in India and the Middle East. In 2008, Albemarle and Weifang Sinobrom Import and Export Company, Ltd. (Sinobrom) reached an agreement in principle to form a new joint venture that will combine the existing business of Sinobrom, a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in China, with Albemarle's global bromine expertise in the specialty chemical industry, forming Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals (Shandong) Company Ltd.[5] in 2009, Albemarle and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) Affiliate, TAYF, create Saudi Organometallic Chemicals Company (SOCC), a Strategic Catalysts Joint Venture, to build a world-scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the Persian Gulf industrial city of Al-Jubail.
In 2012, Albemarle introduced its Electronic Materials business unit and expanded its production capabilities for finished polyolefin catalysts in Baton Rouge. Albemarle also expanded its South Haven API production site and upgraded its multi-product cGMP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility. In 2014, Albemarle completed the sale of its antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses to SI Group, allowing an increased focus on its bromine and catalyst franchises.
Acquisition of Rockwood Holdings[edit]
In July 2014 Albemarle and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. announced a definitive agreement under which Albemarle would acquire all outstanding shares of Rockwood in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $6.2 billion.[12] The acquisition made Albemarle one of the world's premier specialty chemicals companies, with market-leading positions across four high-margin businesses: lithium, catalysts, bromine and surface treatment.
Albemarle completed the acquisition in January 2015, expanding its customer reach as well as increasing its diversity across end markets, technologies and geographies. As a result of the acquisition, Albemarle currently employs approximately 6,900 people and serves customers in approximately 100 countries.
In the wake of completing the acquisition, Albemarle announced it would realign its global business units: Chemetall Surface Treatment, Refining Solutions and Performance Chemicals.[13] Chemetall supplies specialty chemicals, with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics. Refining Solutions provides catalysts that can be used through the entire refinery process. Performance Chemicals will combine the lithium, aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with Albemarle’s existing Performance Chemicals global business unit.
Manufactured products[edit]




The element Bromine


Though beginning as a blotting paper manufacturer, The Ethyl Corporation later abandoned paper manufacturing when it sold Oxford Paper in 1976. Since the late 1990s, Albemarle Corporation has manufactured bromine in countries such as Jordan and France.
Albemarle Corporation became a global leader in the flame-retardant chemicals technologies, with production plants all across the globe in the United States, China, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom. The corporation also has a line of antioxidants and blends which concentrate on improving storage life and stability of fuel and other lubricant products. The acquisition of the phosphorus-based chemistry of Rhodia S.A. included products used in rigid and flexible polyurethane foam applications and ammonium polyphosphate products. Later on, the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH added pigments for paper applications, aluminum oxides used for flame-retardant, polishing agent, catalyst, and niche ceramic applications, as well as magnesium hydroxide mainly used as a flame-retardant.[10]
Since the acquisition of the Catalysts Division of AkzoNobel in 2004, Albemarle Corporation is one of the world's largest producers of hydro processing catalysts (HPC) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in the petroleum refining industry.[14] Production locations (excluding joint ventures in Brasil and Japan) are: Bayport, Texas and Amsterdam, Netherlands.[15]
Following the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings in 2015,[16] Albemarle has become a producer of lithium products, including lithium salts and metals, organo-lithium and cesium and specialty metals. Albemarle continues to penetrate lithium-based energy storage products, including e-mobility batteries and batteries for the automotive industry. Albemarle is also a provider of surface treatment products and services for markets including automotive OEM, aerospace, heavy equipment and more.
Sustainability[edit]
Albemarle's new businesses focus on the manufacture of custom and proprietary fine chemicals and chemical services for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. With the Alternative Fuel Technologies division, Albemarle strives to establish itself as a major player in the fast-growing market of biofuels: gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL). It recently (2008) announced the acquisition of Sorbent Technologies Corporation,[17] whose proprietary technology controls mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Albermarle was one of the three different chemical companies that backed the Citizens for Fire Safety industry group that influenced fire-safety policy by lobbying for flame retardant use in consumer products like furniture and baby products.[18]

History[edit]
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company opened in 1887 with the production of kraft paper, also known as Kraft, and blotting paper.
In 1921, a team of chemists performing research for General Motors discovered tetraethyllead (TEL) had antiknock properties as a gasoline additive. As a result, the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation in Richmond, Virginia began production of tetraethyllead in 1937. TEL remained the primary product of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation through the next four decades. When the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation expanded its product line (particularly to include MMT), its name was changed to the Ethyl Corporation.
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company borrowed $200 million in 1962 and purchased Ethyl Corporation, a company more than thirteen times its size.
Throughout the next few decades, The Ethyl Corporation, under the direction of the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, further expanded their product line to include bromine (in 1969 in Magnolia, Arkansas), lubricant additives (in 1975), and aluminum alkyls (in 1976 in Feluy, Belgium). Further expansion of The Ethyl Corporation included the purchases of Dow Chemical's bromine division, Russ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Potasse et Produits Chimiques (PPC).
In February 1994, Ethyl spun off its chemical businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation.[4] Albemarle was headquartered in Richmond, VA, until 2008 when it announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to Baton Rouge, LA.[5] In 2015 the company announced the relocation of its headquarters from Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Charlotte, North Carolina.[6]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Albemarle Corporation shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Franklin resources and others[7])
Expansion[edit]




Albemarle facility located in Amsterdam.


In July 1994, The Albemarle Corporation expanded itself by acquiring the Asano Corporation,[4] a sales and marketing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The corporation sold both its electronic materials business and its alpha olefins, polyalphaolefins and synthetic alcohols businesses by 1996, and in 1997 formed an alliance with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. That same year, the corporation was restructured to form two global business units: Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals.
In 1998, the Albemarle Corporation bought a custom manufacturing and oilfield chemicals plant in Teesport, England.[8] In the same year, a joint venture was signed between Jordan Dead Sea Industries Company, Arab Potash Company, and one of Albemarle Corporation's subsidiaries.[8] Another joint venture was signed in 2000 by the corporation and Jinhai Chemical and Industry Company, located in China.[9] More chemical plants were opened within the next five years in Port-de-Bouc, France and Bergheim, Germany (after the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH).[10]
Since 2000, Albemarle Corporation has acquired assets of Ferro Corporation's PYRO-CHEK flame retardant business; Martinswerk GmbH; the custom and fine chemicals businesses of ChemFirst Inc.; the Ethyl Corporation's fuel and lubricant antioxidants business; the phosphorus-based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of Rhodia; Atofina S.A.'s (Paris) bromine fine chemicals business; Taerim International Corporation, and the refinery catalyst business of Akzo Nobel N.V.[10]
Also in 2000, Albemarle Corporation, Cytec Industries Inc., and GE Specialty Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Company, announced their intention to form a new business-to-business internet joint venture, PolymerAdditives.com. The creation of this venture was intended to help provide materials faster and more efficiently directly from trusted suppliers.[9]
In the years following, Albemarle acquired its refinery catalysts platform from Akzo Nobel N.V. in 2004 with sites and/or joint ventures in the Netherlands, Houston, France, Brazil, Japan and Singapore.[5] In partnership with UOP, Albemarle created the Hydroprocessing Alliance in 2006 to deliver integrated refinery solutions and hydroprocessing technologies and catalysts to the refining industry.[11]
Albemarle continued its international expansion in 2007, opening a new regional sales office in Dubai to meet growing market needs in India and the Middle East. In 2008, Albemarle and Weifang Sinobrom Import and Export Company, Ltd. (Sinobrom) reached an agreement in principle to form a new joint venture that will combine the existing business of Sinobrom, a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in China, with Albemarle's global bromine expertise in the specialty chemical industry, forming Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals (Shandong) Company Ltd.[5] in 2009, Albemarle and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) Affiliate, TAYF, create Saudi Organometallic Chemicals Company (SOCC), a Strategic Catalysts Joint Venture, to build a world-scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the Persian Gulf industrial city of Al-Jubail.
In 2012, Albemarle introduced its Electronic Materials business unit and expanded its production capabilities for finished polyolefin catalysts in Baton Rouge. Albemarle also expanded its South Haven API production site and upgraded its multi-product cGMP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility. In 2014, Albemarle completed the sale of its antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses to SI Group, allowing an increased focus on its bromine and catalyst franchises.
Acquisition of Rockwood Holdings[edit]
In July 2014 Albemarle and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. announced a definitive agreement under which Albemarle would acquire all outstanding shares of Rockwood in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $6.2 billion.[12] The acquisition made Albemarle one of the world's premier specialty chemicals companies, with market-leading positions across four high-margin businesses: lithium, catalysts, bromine and surface treatment.
Albemarle completed the acquisition in January 2015, expanding its customer reach as well as increasing its diversity across end markets, technologies and geographies. As a result of the acquisition, Albemarle currently employs approximately 6,900 people and serves customers in approximately 100 countries.
In the wake of completing the acquisition, Albemarle announced it would realign its global business units: Chemetall Surface Treatment, Refining Solutions and Performance Chemicals.[13] Chemetall supplies specialty chemicals, with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics. Refining Solutions provides catalysts that can be used through the entire refinery process. Performance Chemicals will combine the lithium, aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with Albemarle’s existing Performance Chemicals global business unit.
Manufactured products[edit]




The element Bromine


Though beginning as a blotting paper manufacturer, The Ethyl Corporation later abandoned paper manufacturing when it sold Oxford Paper in 1976. Since the late 1990s, Albemarle Corporation has manufactured bromine in countries such as Jordan and France.
Albemarle Corporation became a global leader in the flame-retardant chemicals technologies, with production plants all across the globe in the United States, China, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom. The corporation also has a line of antioxidants and blends which concentrate on improving storage life and stability of fuel and other lubricant products. The acquisition of the phosphorus-based chemistry of Rhodia S.A. included products used in rigid and flexible polyurethane foam applications and ammonium polyphosphate products. Later on, the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH added pigments for paper applications, aluminum oxides used for flame-retardant, polishing agent, catalyst, and niche ceramic applications, as well as magnesium hydroxide mainly used as a flame-retardant.[10]
Since the acquisition of the Catalysts Division of AkzoNobel in 2004, Albemarle Corporation is one of the world's largest producers of hydro processing catalysts (HPC) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in the petroleum refining industry.[14] Production locations (excluding joint ventures in Brasil and Japan) are: Bayport, Texas and Amsterdam, Netherlands.[15]

History[edit]
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company opened in 1887 with the production of kraft paper, also known as Kraft, and blotting paper.
In 1921, a team of chemists performing research for General Motors discovered tetraethyllead (TEL) had antiknock properties as a gasoline additive. As a result, the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation in Richmond, Virginia began production of tetraethyllead in 1937. TEL remained the primary product of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation through the next four decades. When the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation expanded its product line (particularly to include MMT), its name was changed to the Ethyl Corporation.
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company borrowed $200 million in 1962 and purchased Ethyl Corporation, a company more than thirteen times its size.
Throughout the next few decades, The Ethyl Corporation, under the direction of the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, further expanded their product line to include bromine (in 1969 in Magnolia, Arkansas), lubricant additives (in 1975), and aluminum alkyls (in 1976 in Feluy, Belgium). Further expansion of The Ethyl Corporation included the purchases of Dow Chemical's bromine division, Russ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Potasse et Produits Chimiques (PPC).
In February 1994, Ethyl spun off its chemical businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation.[4] Albemarle was headquartered in Richmond, VA, until 2008 when it announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to Baton Rouge, LA.[5] In 2015 the company announced the relocation of its headquarters from Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Charlotte, North Carolina.[6]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Albemarle Corporation shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Franklin resources and others[7])
Expansion[edit]




Albemarle facility located in Amsterdam.


In July 1994, The Albemarle Corporation expanded itself by acquiring the Asano Corporation,[4] a sales and marketing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The corporation sold both its electronic materials business and its alpha olefins, polyalphaolefins and synthetic alcohols businesses by 1996, and in 1997 formed an alliance with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. That same year, the corporation was restructured to form two global business units: Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals.
In 1998, the Albemarle Corporation bought a custom manufacturing and oilfield chemicals plant in Teesport, England.[8] In the same year, a joint venture was signed between Jordan Dead Sea Industries Company, Arab Potash Company, and one of Albemarle Corporation's subsidiaries.[8] Another joint venture was signed in 2000 by the corporation and Jinhai Chemical and Industry Company, located in China.[9] More chemical plants were opened within the next five years in Port-de-Bouc, France and Bergheim, Germany (after the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH).[10]
Since 2000, Albemarle Corporation has acquired assets of Ferro Corporation's PYRO-CHEK flame retardant business; Martinswerk GmbH; the custom and fine chemicals businesses of ChemFirst Inc.; the Ethyl Corporation's fuel and lubricant antioxidants business; the phosphorus-based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of Rhodia; Atofina S.A.'s (Paris) bromine fine chemicals business; Taerim International Corporation, and the refinery catalyst business of Akzo Nobel N.V.[10]
Also in 2000, Albemarle Corporation, Cytec Industries Inc., and GE Specialty Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Company, announced their intention to form a new business-to-business internet joint venture, PolymerAdditives.com. The creation of this venture was intended to help provide materials faster and more efficiently directly from trusted suppliers.[9]
In the years following, Albemarle acquired its refinery catalysts platform from Akzo Nobel N.V. in 2004 with sites and/or joint ventures in the Netherlands, Houston, France, Brazil, Japan and Singapore.[5] In partnership with UOP, Albemarle created the Hydroprocessing Alliance in 2006 to deliver integrated refinery solutions and hydroprocessing technologies and catalysts to the refining industry.[11]
Albemarle continued its international expansion in 2007, opening a new regional sales office in Dubai to meet growing market needs in India and the Middle East. In 2008, Albemarle and Weifang Sinobrom Import and Export Company, Ltd. (Sinobrom) reached an agreement in principle to form a new joint venture that will combine the existing business of Sinobrom, a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in China, with Albemarle's global bromine expertise in the specialty chemical industry, forming Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals (Shandong) Company Ltd.[5] in 2009, Albemarle and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) Affiliate, TAYF, create Saudi Organometallic Chemicals Company (SOCC), a Strategic Catalysts Joint Venture, to build a world-scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the Persian Gulf industrial city of Al-Jubail.
In 2012, Albemarle introduced its Electronic Materials business unit and expanded its production capabilities for finished polyolefin catalysts in Baton Rouge. Albemarle also expanded its South Haven API production site and upgraded its multi-product cGMP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility. In 2014, Albemarle completed the sale of its antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses to SI Group, allowing an increased focus on its bromine and catalyst franchises.
Acquisition of Rockwood Holdings[edit]
In July 2014 Albemarle and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. announced a definitive agreement under which Albemarle would acquire all outstanding shares of Rockwood in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $6.2 billion.[12] The acquisition made Albemarle one of the world's premier specialty chemicals companies, with market-leading positions across four high-margin businesses: lithium, catalysts, bromine and surface treatment.
Albemarle completed the acquisition in January 2015, expanding its customer reach as well as increasing its diversity across end markets, technologies and geographies. As a result of the acquisition, Albemarle currently employs approximately 6,900 people and serves customers in approximately 100 countries.
In the wake of completing the acquisition, Albemarle announced it would realign its global business units: Chemetall Surface Treatment, Refining Solutions and Performance Chemicals.[13] Chemetall supplies specialty chemicals, with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics. Refining Solutions provides catalysts that can be used through the entire refinery process. Performance Chemicals will combine the lithium, aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with Albemarle’s existing Performance Chemicals global business unit.
Manufactured products[edit]




The element Bromine


Though beginning as a blotting paper manufacturer, The Ethyl Corporation later abandoned paper manufacturing when it sold Oxford Paper in 1976. Since the late 1990s, Albemarle Corporation has manufactured bromine in countries such as Jordan and France.
Albemarle Corporation became a global leader in the flame-retardant chemicals technologies, with production plants all across the globe in the United States, China, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom. The corporation also has a line of antioxidants and blends which concentrate on improving storage life and stability of fuel and other lubricant products. The acquisition of the phosphorus-based chemistry of Rhodia S.A. included products used in rigid and flexible polyurethane foam applications and ammonium polyphosphate products. Later on, the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH added pigments for paper applications, aluminum oxides used for flame-retardant, polishing agent, catalyst, and niche ceramic applications, as well as magnesium hydroxide mainly used as a flame-retardant.[10]
Since the acquisition of the Catalysts Division of AkzoNobel in 2004, Albemarle Corporation is one of the world's largest producers of hydro processing catalysts (HPC) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in the petroleum refining industry.[14] Production locations (excluding joint ventures in Brasil and Japan) are: Bayport, Texas and Amsterdam, Netherlands.[15]
Following the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings in 2015,[16] Albemarle has become a producer of lithium products, including lithium salts and metals, organo-lithium and cesium and specialty metals. Albemarle continues to penetrate lithium-based energy storage products, including e-mobility batteries and batteries for the automotive industry. Albemarle is also a provider of surface treatment products and services for markets including automotive OEM, aerospace, heavy equipment and more.
Sustainability[edit]
Albemarle's new businesses focus on the manufacture of custom and proprietary fine chemicals and chemical services for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. With the Alternative Fuel Technologies division, Albemarle strives to establish itself as a major player in the fast-growing market of biofuels: gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL). It recently (2008) announced the acquisition of Sorbent Technologies Corporation,[17] whose proprietary technology controls mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Albermarle was one of the three different chemical companies that backed the Citizens for Fire Safety industry group that influenced fire-safety policy by lobbying for flame retardant use in consumer products like furniture and baby products.[18]

History[edit]
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company opened in 1887 with the production of kraft paper, also known as Kraft, and blotting paper.
In 1921, a team of chemists performing research for General Motors discovered tetraethyllead (TEL) had antiknock properties as a gasoline additive. As a result, the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation in Richmond, Virginia began production of tetraethyllead in 1937. TEL remained the primary product of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation through the next four decades. When the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation expanded its product line (particularly to include MMT), its name was changed to the Ethyl Corporation.
The Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company borrowed $200 million in 1962 and purchased Ethyl Corporation, a company more than thirteen times its size.
Throughout the next few decades, The Ethyl Corporation, under the direction of the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company, further expanded their product line to include bromine (in 1969 in Magnolia, Arkansas), lubricant additives (in 1975), and aluminum alkyls (in 1976 in Feluy, Belgium). Further expansion of The Ethyl Corporation included the purchases of Dow Chemical's bromine division, Russ Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Potasse et Produits Chimiques (PPC).
In February 1994, Ethyl spun off its chemical businesses to create an independent, publicly traded company named Albemarle Corporation.[4] Albemarle was headquartered in Richmond, VA, until 2008 when it announced plans to move its corporate headquarters to Baton Rouge, LA.[5] In 2015 the company announced the relocation of its headquarters from Baton Rouge, Louisiana to Charlotte, North Carolina.[6]
Ownership[edit]
As of 2017 Albemarle Corporation shares are mainly held by institutional investors (The Vanguard Group, BlackRock, Franklin resources and others[7])
Expansion[edit]




Albemarle facility located in Amsterdam.


In July 1994, The Albemarle Corporation expanded itself by acquiring the Asano Corporation,[4] a sales and marketing company headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The corporation sold both its electronic materials business and its alpha olefins, polyalphaolefins and synthetic alcohols businesses by 1996, and in 1997 formed an alliance with Mitsui Toatsu Chemicals, Inc. That same year, the corporation was restructured to form two global business units: Polymer Chemicals and Fine Chemicals.
In 1998, the Albemarle Corporation bought a custom manufacturing and oilfield chemicals plant in Teesport, England.[8] In the same year, a joint venture was signed between Jordan Dead Sea Industries Company, Arab Potash Company, and one of Albemarle Corporation's subsidiaries.[8] Another joint venture was signed in 2000 by the corporation and Jinhai Chemical and Industry Company, located in China.[9] More chemical plants were opened within the next five years in Port-de-Bouc, France and Bergheim, Germany (after the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH).[10]
Since 2000, Albemarle Corporation has acquired assets of Ferro Corporation's PYRO-CHEK flame retardant business; Martinswerk GmbH; the custom and fine chemicals businesses of ChemFirst Inc.; the Ethyl Corporation's fuel and lubricant antioxidants business; the phosphorus-based polyurethane flame retardants businesses of Rhodia; Atofina S.A.'s (Paris) bromine fine chemicals business; Taerim International Corporation, and the refinery catalyst business of Akzo Nobel N.V.[10]
Also in 2000, Albemarle Corporation, Cytec Industries Inc., and GE Specialty Chemicals, Inc., a subsidiary of General Electric Company, announced their intention to form a new business-to-business internet joint venture, PolymerAdditives.com. The creation of this venture was intended to help provide materials faster and more efficiently directly from trusted suppliers.[9]
In the years following, Albemarle acquired its refinery catalysts platform from Akzo Nobel N.V. in 2004 with sites and/or joint ventures in the Netherlands, Houston, France, Brazil, Japan and Singapore.[5] In partnership with UOP, Albemarle created the Hydroprocessing Alliance in 2006 to deliver integrated refinery solutions and hydroprocessing technologies and catalysts to the refining industry.[11]
Albemarle continued its international expansion in 2007, opening a new regional sales office in Dubai to meet growing market needs in India and the Middle East. In 2008, Albemarle and Weifang Sinobrom Import and Export Company, Ltd. (Sinobrom) reached an agreement in principle to form a new joint venture that will combine the existing business of Sinobrom, a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in China, with Albemarle's global bromine expertise in the specialty chemical industry, forming Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals (Shandong) Company Ltd.[5] in 2009, Albemarle and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) Affiliate, TAYF, create Saudi Organometallic Chemicals Company (SOCC), a Strategic Catalysts Joint Venture, to build a world-scale organometallics production facility strategically located in the Persian Gulf industrial city of Al-Jubail.
In 2012, Albemarle introduced its Electronic Materials business unit and expanded its production capabilities for finished polyolefin catalysts in Baton Rouge. Albemarle also expanded its South Haven API production site and upgraded its multi-product cGMP active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) manufacturing facility. In 2014, Albemarle completed the sale of its antioxidant, ibuprofen and propofol businesses to SI Group, allowing an increased focus on its bromine and catalyst franchises.
Acquisition of Rockwood Holdings[edit]
In July 2014 Albemarle and Rockwood Holdings, Inc. announced a definitive agreement under which Albemarle would acquire all outstanding shares of Rockwood in a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $6.2 billion.[12] The acquisition made Albemarle one of the world's premier specialty chemicals companies, with market-leading positions across four high-margin businesses: lithium, catalysts, bromine and surface treatment.
Albemarle completed the acquisition in January 2015, expanding its customer reach as well as increasing its diversity across end markets, technologies and geographies. As a result of the acquisition, Albemarle currently employs approximately 6,900 people and serves customers in approximately 100 countries.
In the wake of completing the acquisition, Albemarle announced it would realign its global business units: Chemetall Surface Treatment, Refining Solutions and Performance Chemicals.[13] Chemetall supplies specialty chemicals, with a focus on processes for the surface treatment of metals and plastics. Refining Solutions provides catalysts that can be used through the entire refinery process. Performance Chemicals will combine the lithium, aluminum alkyls and derivative catalysts businesses with Albemarle’s existing Performance Chemicals global business unit.
Manufactured products[edit]




The element Bromine


Though beginning as a blotting paper manufacturer, The Ethyl Corporation later abandoned paper manufacturing when it sold Oxford Paper in 1976. Since the late 1990s, Albemarle Corporation has manufactured bromine in countries such as Jordan and France.
Albemarle Corporation became a global leader in the flame-retardant chemicals technologies, with production plants all across the globe in the United States, China, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom. The corporation also has a line of antioxidants and blends which concentrate on improving storage life and stability of fuel and other lubricant products. The acquisition of the phosphorus-based chemistry of Rhodia S.A. included products used in rigid and flexible polyurethane foam applications and ammonium polyphosphate products. Later on, the acquisition of Martinswerk GmbH added pigments for paper applications, aluminum oxides used for flame-retardant, polishing agent, catalyst, and niche ceramic applications, as well as magnesium hydroxide mainly used as a flame-retardant.[10]
Since the acquisition of the Catalysts Division of AkzoNobel in 2004, Albemarle Corporation is one of the world's largest producers of hydro processing catalysts (HPC) and fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts used in the petroleum refining industry.[14] Production locations (excluding joint ventures in Brasil and Japan) are: Bayport, Texas and Amsterdam, Netherlands.[15]
Following the acquisition of Rockwood Holdings in 2015,[16] Albemarle has become a producer of lithium products, including lithium salts and metals, organo-lithium and cesium and specialty metals. Albemarle continues to penetrate lithium-based energy storage products, including e-mobility batteries and batteries for the automotive industry. Albemarle is also a provider of surface treatment products and services for markets including automotive OEM, aerospace, heavy equipment and more.
Sustainability[edit]
Albemarle's new businesses focus on the manufacture of custom and proprietary fine chemicals and chemical services for the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries. With the Alternative Fuel Technologies division, Albemarle strives to establish itself as a major player in the fast-growing market of biofuels: gas-to-liquids (GTL), coal-to-liquids (CTL). It recently (2008) announced the acquisition of Sorbent Technologies Corporation,[17] whose proprietary technology controls mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. Albermarle was one of the three different chemical companies that backed the Citizens for Fire Safety industry group that influenced fire-safety policy by lobbying for flame retardant use in consumer products like furniture and baby products.[18]

					Full Description



Albemarle Corporation, incorporated on November 24, 1993, is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals. The Company operates through three segments: Lithium and Advanced Materials, Bromine Specialties and Refining Solutions. Lithium and Advanced Materials segment consists of two product categories: Lithium and Performance Catalyst Solutions. The bromine and bromine-based business includes products used in fire safety solutions and other specialty chemicals applications. The Company serves various end markets, including petroleum refining, consumer electronics, energy storage, construction, automotive, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, crop protection, food safety and custom chemistry services.Lithium and Advanced MaterialsThe Lithium business is a producer of diverse product portfolios of lithium derivatives in the industry. It develops and manufactures a range of basic lithium compounds, including lithium carbonate, lithium hydroxide, lithium chloride, and value-added lithium specialties and reagents, including butyllithium and lithium aluminum hydride. Lithium is used in a variety of applications and industries, which include lithium batteries used in consumer electronics and automobiles, high performance greases, thermoplastic elastomers for car tires, rubber soles and plastic bottles, catalysts for chemical reactions, organic synthesis processes in the areas of steroid chemistry and vitamins, various life science applications, as well as intermediates in the pharmaceutical industry, among other applications. It also develops and manufactures cesium products for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, and zirconium, barium and titanium products for various pyrotechnical applications, including airbag igniters. It also provides technical services, including the handling and use of reactive lithium products. It also offers its customers recycling services for lithium-containing by-products resulting from synthesis with organolithium products, lithium metal and other reagents.The Company has four product lines in its Performance Catalyst Solutions (PCS) division: polymer catalysts, curatives, organometallics and electronic materials. It manufactures organometallic co-catalysts (aluminum, magnesium and zinc alkyls), as well as metallocene components and co-catalysts (methylaluminumoxane, organoborons, metallocene compounds, and finished polymerization catalysts comprising these products). It also offers finished single-site catalysts with or without its ActivCat activation technology and a line of Ziegler-Natta catalysts under the Advantage brand. Its co-catalysts and finished catalysts are used in customers' production of polyolefin polymers. Such polymers are commodity like Ziegler-Natta polymerization technology-based and specialty like, Single Site polymerization technology-based plastics serving a variety of end markets, including packaging, non-packaging, films and injection molding. Its organometallic products are also used in the manufacture of alpha-olefins like, hexene, octene, decene. In electronic materials, it manufactures and sells metal organic products into electronic applications, such as the production of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) for displays and general lighting, as well as other products used in the production of solar cells. Its curatives include a range of curing agents used in polyurethanes, epoxies and other engineered resins.Bromine Specialties SegmentThe bromine and bromine-based business includes products used in fire safety solutions and other specialty chemicals applications. Its fire safety technology enables the use of plastics in performance, high heat applications by enhancing the flame resistant properties of these materials. The end market products that benefit from its fire safety technology include plastic enclosures for consumer electronics, printed circuit boards, wire and cable products, electrical connectors, textiles and foam insulation. The bromine-based business also includes specialty chemicals products, such as elemental bromine, alkyl bromides, inorganic bromides, brominated powdered activated carbon and a number of bromine fine chemicals. These specialty products are used in chemical synthesis, oil and gas well drilling and completion fluids, mercury control, water purification, beef and poultry processing and various other industrial applications. Other specialty chemicals that it produces include tertiary amines for surfactants, biocides, and disinfectants and sanitizers.Refining Solutions SegmentThe Refining Solutions Segment has two product lines: Clean Fuels Technologies, which comprises hydroprocessing catalysts (HPC), and Heavy Oil Upgrading (HOU), which comprises fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) catalysts and additives. HPC products are applied throughout the refining industry. Their application enables the upgrading of oil fractions to clean fuels and other usable oil feedstocks and products by removing sulfur, nitrogen and other impurities from the feedstock. In addition, they improve product properties by adding hydrogen and in some cases improve the performance of downstream catalysts and processes. FCC catalysts assist in the cracking of less desired refinery petroleum streams into derivative and products, such as transportation fuels and petrochemical feedstocks like propylene. Its FCC additives are used to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide in FCC units and to increase liquefied petroleum gas olefins yield, such as propylene, and to boost octane in gasoline. Its refinery catalysts are used to crack and treat all feedstocks while meeting refinery yield and product needs.The Company competes with FMC Corporation, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile S.A., SichuanTianqi Lithium, Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium, Cabot Corporation, Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, AkzoNobel, Chemtura Corporation, Lonza, W.R. Grace & Co., Israel Chemicals Ltd, Criterion Catalysts and Technologies, Advanced Refining Technologies, Haldor Topsoe, BASF Corporation and China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec).
