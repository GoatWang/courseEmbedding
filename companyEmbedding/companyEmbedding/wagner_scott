A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Nonfiction books span the gamut of human experience, and some people have done unbelievable things. Nonfiction isn't limited to memoirs and biographies, either; it covers anything that isn't made up.Take a Step Into the PastHistory has always been a popular form of nonfiction, largely because there are so many different kinds of history. You can study everything from military history, to the history of quilting on the Canadian prairies. Anything people have ever done has a history, and in most cases you can find a nonfiction book about it. History covers everything from the broad sweep of empires to the personal stories of a single week in an individual's life. It's the story of humanity.Discover Your Inner SpiritualityEven as the world grows more and more materialistic, people find themselves turning toward nonfiction books on religion and spirituality. These books provide many people a way to find meaning in a world that is moving faster and faster every day. You can find everything from closely reasoned apologetics for the major faiths, to New Age life guides in the same place. Perhaps you'll succeed at your quest for meaning between the pages of a nonfiction book.Everyone Has to EatAll cultures have one thing in common; recipes. No matter what the culture, someone has written a cookbook, spreading cuisine around the world. You can find books on French, German, Italian, Caribbean, and just about any other form of cuisine you can imagine. In addition to cookbooks, there is also a whole world of diet books. Whether you want to lose weight, gain weight, or manage a health condition, there is a diet book to fit your needs.The Eyes Have ItArt and photography books bring the vision of the world to your very eyes. Art is fundamental to the human experience, and just one art book can show you millions of dollars' worth of old masters from around the world without the need to leave your couch.

Detailed item info
SynopsisIn this moving memoir, Robert J. Wagner opens his heart to share the romances, the drama, and the humor of an incredible life He grew up in Bel Air next door to a golf course that changed his life. As a young boy, he saw a foursome playing one morning featuring none other than Fred Astaire, Clark Gable, Randolph Scott, and Cary Grant. Seeing these giants of the silver screen awed him and fueled his dreams of becoming a movie star. Battling a revolving door of boarding schools and a father who wanted him to forget Hollywood and join the family business, sixteen-year-old Wagner started like any naïve kid wouldwalking along Sunset Boulevard, hoping that a producer or director would notice him. Under the mentorship of stars like Spencer Tracy, he would become a salaried actor in Hollywood's studio system among other hot actors of the moment such as his friends Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis. Working with studio mogul Darryl Zanuck, Wagner began to appear in a number of films alongside the most beautiful starletsbut his first love was Barbara Stanwyck, an actress twice his age. As his career blossomed, and after he separated from Stanwyck, he met the woman who would change his life forever, Natalie Wood. They fell instantly and deeply in love and stayed together until the stress of their careershers marching upward, his inexplicably deflatingdrove them to divorce. Trying to forget the pain, he made more movies and spent his time in Europe with the likes of Steve McQueen, Sophia Loren, Peter Sellers, Laurence Olivier, David Niven, Liz Taylor, and Joan Collins. He would meet and marry the beautiful former model and actress Marion Marshall. Together they had a daughter and made their way back to America, where he found himself at the beginning of a new era in Hollywoodthe blossoming of television. Lew Wasserman and later Aaron Spelling would work with Wagner as he produced and starred in some of the most successful programs in history. Despite his newfound success, his marriage to Marion fell apart. He looked no further than Natalie Wood, for whom he still pined. To the world's surprise, they fell in love all over again, this time more deeply and with maturity. As she settled into a domestic life, raising their own daughter, Courtney, as well as their children from previous marriages, Wagner became the sole provider, reaping the riches of television success. Their life together was cut tragically short, though, when Wood died after falling from their yacht. For the first time, Wagner writes about that tremendously painful time. After a serious bout with depression, he finally resurfaced and eventually married Jill St. John, who helped keep his family and his fractured heart together. With color photographs and never-before-told stories, this is a quintessentially American story of one of the great sons of Hollywood.Product IdentifiersISBN-100061373311ISBN-139780061373312Key DetailsAuthorRobert J., Jr. Wagner, Scott EymanNumber Of Pages320 pagesFormatHardcoverPublication Date2008-09-23LanguageEnglishPublisherHarperCollins PublishersPublication Year20080000Additional DetailsCopyright Date2008IllustratedYesDimensionsWeight20.8 OzHeight1.1 In.Width6.3 In.Length9.3 In.Target AudienceGroupTradeClassification MethodLCCN2008-029476LC Classification NumberPN2287.W235A3 2008Dewey Decimal791.4302/8092Dewey Edition22ReviewsReviews"Engaging", "Mesmerizing.", "Pieces of My Heart is a treasure. . . .

Author R Wagner
This actor is really a good writer. He has a good sense of humor and a great memory and stories of the "old" Hollywood studio system..

Interesting and insightful.
I liked the book because it contained many behind the scenes stories... and he was very honest, both good and bad, about the people that he knew and had worked with.

Good book
Fairly good book by a Hollywood Veteran.  A bit over the top and forced dramatic license where his female conquests are written of.  Certainly a must read fir a Wagner fan.

Pieces Of My Heart
Very poorly written, more likle a diary than any specific information.  Disjointed as it hops from one place to another without any real tie together information.  Nearly everyone has been wrong with the exception of him.
Strange I had looked forward to reading his book and was disapointed with the contents and the way it was put together.
I worked in that town for more than 50 years and was in the entertainment industry for a significant amount of that time.  Stories always circulated about the various personalities most of which were press agents dreams and he managed to stay clean of most until the later part of his career and then in an attempt to get a grater return for whatever he contributed to the entertainment he tried to get in on the financing and with poor business sence he ended up taking the people that he was involved with to courts in attempts to get more money than he was actually due.  Tye result was his name gradually went down as far as being a nice guy. I would not recommend his book to anyone that is looking for factual information or any real insite as to what made Mr. Wagner run.

Not a great title or very appropriate to content.
If you grew up in the 60's you'll enjoy this book.  Lots of "old Hollywood" references and stories.  Felt it wasn't all that informative and that "RJ" kept it superficial in many respects.  Probably part of the reason he never become a big-time movie star.  Nice guy, great father, lotsa baggage.  Sounds like most everyone.
