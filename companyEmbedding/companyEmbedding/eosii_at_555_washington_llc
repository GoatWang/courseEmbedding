While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the formalities imposed on other types of businesses, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). LLCs are also eligible for "pass-through" taxation, which means that the company's income taxes are only reflected on each owner's personal tax return, not at the business level. To learn more about forming an LLC, click the link below.Learn more about forming an LLC  C CorporationForm a C Corporation (C Corp)The C Corporation (C Corp) is what most people think of when they hear the word "corporation". Most large companies are formed under this structure as it offers the most tax related options for business owners. It provides the greatest level of separation between the company and its owners, and allows the company to raise capital through the issuance of publicly traded stock. However, the many formal requirements placed on C Corps prevent the structure from being the ideal choice for many smaller organizations. To learn more about forming an C Corp, click the link below.Learn more about forming a C Corporation  S CorporationForm a S Corporation (S Corp)The S Corporation (S Corp) structure is similar to the C Corp, with a few notable differences. The most important of these differences is that S Corps are eligible for special pass through taxation status with the IRS. This allows S Corp owners to avoid double taxation on their business income. S Corps must request pass through taxation status, by filing Form 2553 with IRS after successfully incorporating.

Why Incorporate | Why You Should Incorporate Your Business | Swyft Filings Home   Starting Your Business  Why Incorporate Your Business? About Us Pricing Overview Our 5 Step Process Why Incorporate General FAQs Our GuaranteeThe Benefits of IncorporatingIncorporating your business offers a unique mix of benefits, many of which are unavailable to informal business structures such as sole proprietorships and general partnerships. If you are looking for tax flexibility, limited liability, and the option to raise capital, incorporation may be the best path for you. The following are four of the major benefits of incorporation:Increased CredibilityBeing recognized as a corporation proves to creditors and potential clients that your business is organized according to state law. By simply adding “Inc” or “LLC” to the end of your business name gives you the professional look and credibility that many customers are looking for.Tax Benefits Corporation owners are able to deduct many more expenses than those who own informal businesses. These write-offs can be substantial since insurance, travel, and entertainment are deductions. Corporation owners are also free from paying certain self-employment taxes, which informal business owners must pay.Asset ProtectionIn the event that a corporation becomes unable to pay its debts, the owners are given limited liability status. This means that their personal funds or assets cannot be collected in order to pay business debts. In the event legal proceedings are brought against the corporation, the owners’ personal assets are protected.Perpetual lifespan If your business is incorporated, it will not be forced to dissolve due to changes in ownership. The transfer of ownership is typically accomplished through the simple sale of common or unrestricted preferred stock or by membership interest transfers. Informal business structures are not perpetual entities, so in the event that an owner dies or wants to sell, the business typically ceases to exist in its current form. Being a perpetual entity makes it easier for incorporated businesses to get bank loans and to attract investors.

We love to help!Should I form my business as an LLC?Despite being a relatively new option, the limited liability company (LLC) is now one of the most popular business structures among smaller organizations. While allowing business owners to remain free from a great deal of the regulations imposed on other types of companies, it still provides limited liability protection for its owners (members). This means that the personal assets of an LLC's ownership cannot be collected to fulfill the debts of the business. What is involved in forming an LLC?All states require potential LLC owners to file a substantial set of documents, typically called the Articles of Organization, in order to establish their business. We can take care of this process for you, saving you time, effort, and allowing you to focus on developing your business – not filing paperwork. How should I name my LLC?The name you choose for your LLC is an important decision, as it will be how you represent yourself to potential associates and clients. With that in mind, it is advisable that you take some time to craft a name that you will be proud to have representing you and your business.Your name must be unique, and not deceptively similar, to any other trademarked name or business. It is also required that your name not be used to intentionally misrepresent the products or services you offer. For LLCs, nearly all states will also require you to add a signifier of your limited liability status, such as "LLC" or "L.L.C." to the end of your company's name. You may be able to operate under a name other than your formal LLC name by applying for and using a dba. Are there a required number of individuals needed to form an LLC?There is no minimum requirement as to the number of owners (also referred to as members) that an LLC must have. At the federal level, single-member LLCs qualify for pass-through taxation, however this is not always true at the state level.
