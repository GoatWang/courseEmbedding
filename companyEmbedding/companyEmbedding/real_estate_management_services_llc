Learn More About Professional Property Management



What is Property Management?
Property management—also known as real estate management—encompasses all aspects of running an income property, from finding and screening tenants to maintaining the property, collecting rent, and handling any issues that arise. 
While some professional property managers specialize in certain types of services, most are prepared to take full responsibility for your property—unless you'd prefer to handle certain things yourself. To learn more about the services property management companies offer, read 10 Reasons to Hire a Property Manager.

Why Use a Professional Property Manager?
Professional property management can make owning (and profiting from!) rental properties a hassle-free experience. 
For most, the decision to use a professional real estate manager is a simple cost/benefit equation. Not only are they experts at handling properties and tenants, they generally take only a small percentage of the monthly rent in exchange for their services. When you consider what you get in return—a hassle-free, essentially passive income stream—the decision to employ a professional property manager is a no-brainer for the majority of rental property owners.
While the right property manager can greatly benefit any rental property owner, you might especially want to consider hiring one if any of the following things are true:

You live further than a couple of neighborhoods away from your rental property
You're not a home maintenance guru
You don't have at least 10-12 hours per month to deal with tasks related to your rental property
You don't want to have to make yourself constantly available in case of emergency
You don't have a good working knowledge of landlord-tenant law
You don't ever want to have to worry about dealing with difficult or non-paying tenants

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a commercial property manager?
While it may be possible to manage a small commercial property on your own, if you're hoping to expand your portfolio of propertiesor just want to free up your own timehiring a property management company can be a smart, cost-effective investment. 
A commercial property manager can:

Fill vacancies in a timely manner
Maximize the value of your lease agreements
Handle both day-to-day and emergency maintenance
Build and maintain good relationships with tenants
Take care of accounting and provide regular financial statements

No matter what the scale of your commercial property, a professional property management company can help improve your ROI. 



View More



 

What should I look for in a commercial property management company?
Managing commercial properties requires different expertise than the management of residential buildings. While there is some overlap in the skills required, you should look for a property management company that is either specifically dedicated to commercial property management or has a team devoted exclusively to commercial. 
In addition to the skills that residential property managers typically provide, commercial property management firms often also provide asset management, and work with you to ensure that your investment is a profitable one. Specific asset management services typically include analysis of the following:

Investment strategies and development opportunities
Lease proposals
Cash flow and general financials
Risk

Commercial property management companies typically have experience managing multimillion dollar portfolios in addition to providing large scale professional facilities management.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.

Investment Philosophy 

Focus on Value
                        Our objective is to generate  excess returns over a market cycle by purchasing 
                        public real estate enterprises at a discount to the private market valuation of the underlying real estate holdings.

Focus  on Yield and Cash Flow
                        Our investment process  emphasizes dividend yield in REIT structures, and free 
                        cash flow in non-REIT companies.

Focus on Non-Core Strategy 
                        An all-cap strategy that may  contain REITs, Real Estate Operating Companies, 
                        and REIT preferred equities. It is a differentiated product that does not mimic REIT indices or ETFs.

Focus on Diversification and  Liquidity
                        Portfolios are diversified across  sectors, geographic locations and tenant exposure
                        to protect capital. All holdings are publicly traded and offer short term liquidity to our investors. We do not invest in the direct ownership of real estate.

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of real estate as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.
Property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

Roles[edit]
There are many facets to this profession, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.
Property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management.
Licensing[edit]
Australia[edit]
Every state of Australia has different licensing and compliance requirements. Generally, to be able to provide property management services, a real estate licence is required. State of Victoria Australia information[1]
Canada[edit]
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the Province of Quebec where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.
British Columbia – licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BC Real Estate Council (BCREC).
Ontario – no licensing is required to operate, however ACMO – the Association of Condo Managers of Ontario is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO) the Real Estate Council of Ontario, regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its condominium act. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.
Saskatchewan and Alberta both require property managers to hold a real estate license.
India[edit]
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet, but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.
New Zealand[edit]
Residential property managers in New Zealand currently come in two types. Those that are licensed and those that are unlicensed. The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation.Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers. A copy of the Minister's announcement is available at: www.beehive.govt.nz.
New Zealand licensed property managers offer a full and complete service with qualified professionals who collect rent through an audited trust account to protect both investment property owners and tenants. Also licensed property managers adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice which outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Unlicensed property managers do not require any registration, minimum knowledge or skill, or adhere to any code of practice to offer a property management service.
Consequently, the services offered in New Zealand are varied where both licensed and unlicensed property managers have a mixed track record in delivery services to this industry.
The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate. A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.[2]
The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952.
Republic of Ireland[edit]
In the Republic of Ireland, there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments, and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.
Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.
The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.
Romania[edit]
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under Financial business law, Any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities. Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies. Companies which manage rented residential property are often members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. Companies or individual landlords who accept tenancy deposits for "assured shorthold tenancies" (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a Tenancy Deposit Scheme.
Companies which manage apartment buildings are often members of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA).[3] ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England & Wales. ARMA promotes high standards of leasehold management by providing advice, training and guidance to its member firms of managing agents. ARMA also produces guidance materials for leaseholders and Residents Management Companies. With over 280 firms in membership, ARMA also campaigns for improvements in the legislation governing the leasehold sector.
United States[edit]
Most states, such as New York,[4] Texas,[5] and Colorado,[6] require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.[7] A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.[8]
Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company.[citation needed]
In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a Real Estate Broker. A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.[9] California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.[10]
The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as Realtor, Agent[disambiguation needed], or Salesperson.

Property Management Software[edit]
Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers are able to function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a major cause of the price declines. In addition to the core property management software options, there is a quickly growing number of closely related software products being introduced to the industry.[citation needed]
Business models[edit]
Percentage of rent[edit]
This is the most common model, and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don't usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount, and shares the rest with the property owner.
Fixed fee[edit]
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.
Guaranteed rent[edit]
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company's income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.
Revenue share[edit]
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue.[citation needed] There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.[citation needed]

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of real estate as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.
Property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

Roles[edit]
There are many facets to this profession, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.
Property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management.
Licensing[edit]
Australia[edit]
Every state of Australia has different licensing and compliance requirements. Generally, to be able to provide property management services, a real estate licence is required. State of Victoria Australia information[1]
Canada[edit]
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the Province of Quebec where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.
British Columbia – licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BC Real Estate Council (BCREC).
Ontario – no licensing is required to operate, however ACMO – the Association of Condo Managers of Ontario is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO) the Real Estate Council of Ontario, regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its condominium act. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.
Saskatchewan and Alberta both require property managers to hold a real estate license.
India[edit]
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet, but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.
New Zealand[edit]
Residential property managers in New Zealand currently come in two types. Those that are licensed and those that are unlicensed. The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation.Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers. A copy of the Minister's announcement is available at: www.beehive.govt.nz.
New Zealand licensed property managers offer a full and complete service with qualified professionals who collect rent through an audited trust account to protect both investment property owners and tenants. Also licensed property managers adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice which outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Unlicensed property managers do not require any registration, minimum knowledge or skill, or adhere to any code of practice to offer a property management service.
Consequently, the services offered in New Zealand are varied where both licensed and unlicensed property managers have a mixed track record in delivery services to this industry.
The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate. A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.[2]
The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952.
Republic of Ireland[edit]
In the Republic of Ireland, there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments, and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.
Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.
The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.
Romania[edit]
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under Financial business law, Any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities. Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies. Companies which manage rented residential property are often members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. Companies or individual landlords who accept tenancy deposits for "assured shorthold tenancies" (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a Tenancy Deposit Scheme.
Companies which manage apartment buildings are often members of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA).[3] ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England & Wales. ARMA promotes high standards of leasehold management by providing advice, training and guidance to its member firms of managing agents. ARMA also produces guidance materials for leaseholders and Residents Management Companies. With over 280 firms in membership, ARMA also campaigns for improvements in the legislation governing the leasehold sector.
United States[edit]
Most states, such as New York,[4] Texas,[5] and Colorado,[6] require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.[7] A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.[8]
Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company.[citation needed]
In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a Real Estate Broker. A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.[9] California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.[10]
The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as Realtor, Agent[disambiguation needed], or Salesperson.

Property Management Software[edit]
Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers are able to function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a major cause of the price declines. In addition to the core property management software options, there is a quickly growing number of closely related software products being introduced to the industry.[citation needed]
Business models[edit]
Percentage of rent[edit]
This is the most common model, and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don't usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount, and shares the rest with the property owner.
Fixed fee[edit]
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.
Guaranteed rent[edit]
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company's income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.
Revenue share[edit]
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue.[citation needed] There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.[citation needed]

United States[edit]
Most states, such as New York,[4] Texas,[5] and Colorado,[6] require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.[7] A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.[8]
Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company.[citation needed]
In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a Real Estate Broker. A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.[9] California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.[10]
The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as Realtor, Agent[disambiguation needed], or Salesperson.

Property Management Software[edit]
Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers are able to function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a major cause of the price declines. In addition to the core property management software options, there is a quickly growing number of closely related software products being introduced to the industry.[citation needed]
Business models[edit]
Percentage of rent[edit]
This is the most common model, and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don't usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount, and shares the rest with the property owner.
Fixed fee[edit]
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.
Guaranteed rent[edit]
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company's income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.
Revenue share[edit]
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue.[citation needed] There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.[citation needed]

Property management is the operation, control, and oversight of real estate as used in its most broad terms. Management indicates a need to be cared for, monitored and accountability given for its useful life and condition. This is much akin to the role of management in any business.
Property management is also the management of personal property, equipment, tooling, and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair, and maintain end item deliverables. Property management involves the processes, systems, and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including acquisition, control, accountability, responsibility, maintenance, utilization, and disposition.

Roles[edit]
There are many facets to this profession, including managing the accounts and finances of the real estate properties, and participating in or initiating litigation with tenants, contractors and insurance agencies. Litigation is at times considered a separate function, set aside for trained attorneys. Although a person will be responsible for this in his/her job description, there may be an attorney working under a property manager. Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.
Property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management.
Licensing[edit]
Australia[edit]
Every state of Australia has different licensing and compliance requirements. Generally, to be able to provide property management services, a real estate licence is required. State of Victoria Australia information[1]
Canada[edit]
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the Province of Quebec where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.
British Columbia – licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BC Real Estate Council (BCREC).
Ontario – no licensing is required to operate, however ACMO – the Association of Condo Managers of Ontario is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO) the Real Estate Council of Ontario, regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its condominium act. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.
Saskatchewan and Alberta both require property managers to hold a real estate license.
India[edit]
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet, but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.
New Zealand[edit]
Residential property managers in New Zealand currently come in two types. Those that are licensed and those that are unlicensed. The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation.Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers. A copy of the Minister's announcement is available at: www.beehive.govt.nz.
New Zealand licensed property managers offer a full and complete service with qualified professionals who collect rent through an audited trust account to protect both investment property owners and tenants. Also licensed property managers adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice which outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Unlicensed property managers do not require any registration, minimum knowledge or skill, or adhere to any code of practice to offer a property management service.
Consequently, the services offered in New Zealand are varied where both licensed and unlicensed property managers have a mixed track record in delivery services to this industry.
The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate. A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.[2]
The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952.
Republic of Ireland[edit]
In the Republic of Ireland, there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments, and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.
Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.
The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.
Romania[edit]
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under Financial business law, Any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities. Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies. Companies which manage rented residential property are often members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. Companies or individual landlords who accept tenancy deposits for "assured shorthold tenancies" (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a Tenancy Deposit Scheme.
Companies which manage apartment buildings are often members of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA).[3] ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England & Wales. ARMA promotes high standards of leasehold management by providing advice, training and guidance to its member firms of managing agents. ARMA also produces guidance materials for leaseholders and Residents Management Companies. With over 280 firms in membership, ARMA also campaigns for improvements in the legislation governing the leasehold sector.
United States[edit]
Most states, such as New York,[4] Texas,[5] and Colorado,[6] require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.[7] A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.[8]
Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company.[citation needed]
In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a Real Estate Broker. A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.[9] California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.[10]
The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as Realtor, Agent[disambiguation needed], or Salesperson.

Special attention is given to landlord/tenant law and most commonly evictions, non-payment, harassment, reduction of pre-arranged services, and public nuisance are legal subjects that gain the most amount of attention from property managers. Therefore, it is a necessity that a property manager be current with applicable municipal, county, state and Federal Fair Housing laws and practices.
Property management, like facility management, is increasingly facilitated by computer-aided facility management.
Licensing[edit]
Australia[edit]
Every state of Australia has different licensing and compliance requirements. Generally, to be able to provide property management services, a real estate licence is required. State of Victoria Australia information[1]
Canada[edit]
In Canada, the laws governing property management and landlord/tenant relations are, generally speaking, a Provincial responsibility. Each Province and Territory makes its own laws on these matters. In most cases any person or company can offer property management services, and there are licensing requirements. Other than specific laws in each Province and Territory governing these matters, they are governed by English Common Law, except in the Province of Quebec where the Civil Code is used in place of English Common Law. In some cities, the Provincial Legislation is supplemented by City by-laws.
British Columbia – licensing of property managers is regulated by the provincial government and licensing by the BC Real Estate Council (BCREC).
Ontario – no licensing is required to operate, however ACMO – the Association of Condo Managers of Ontario is a self-governing body for certification and designation of its members who run buildings with more than 600 units. (RECO) the Real Estate Council of Ontario, regulates licensed realtors in Ontario. The provincial government is revising its condominium act. After public consultation, it hopes to put forth legislation during the 2015–2016 session requiring Condo Management firms and staff or condo employees and boards to be accredited.
Saskatchewan and Alberta both require property managers to hold a real estate license.
India[edit]
In India, there is no statutory regulation of property management companies, real estate agents or developers. In 2013, a Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet, but has yet to take effect. The bill seeks to set up 3 regulatory bodies in the country. The Real Estate Regulation and Development Bill was passed by the Union Cabinet in early 2016 and this is expected to bring about a sea change in the management of real estate in India.
New Zealand[edit]
Residential property managers in New Zealand currently come in two types. Those that are licensed and those that are unlicensed. The New Zealand Government reviewed whether all forms of property management need any legislation.Following completion of the review, the Associate Minister of Justice, Hon Nathan Guy, announced on 2 July 2009 that no new occupational regulation would be imposed on property managers. A copy of the Minister's announcement is available at: www.beehive.govt.nz.
New Zealand licensed property managers offer a full and complete service with qualified professionals who collect rent through an audited trust account to protect both investment property owners and tenants. Also licensed property managers adhere to the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand property management code of practice which outlines industry best practices for dealing with the public. Unlicensed property managers do not require any registration, minimum knowledge or skill, or adhere to any code of practice to offer a property management service.
Consequently, the services offered in New Zealand are varied where both licensed and unlicensed property managers have a mixed track record in delivery services to this industry.
The Unit Titles Act 2010 sets out the law for the ownership and management of unit title developments, where multiple owners each hold a unit title. The Act covers the set-up of such developments, body corporate governance, the rights and obligations of the body corporate and unit owners, disclosure between buyers and sellers, dispute resolution etc. The Unit Titles Regulations 2011 provide operational guidelines. The body corporate is responsible for financial and administrative functions relating to the common property and the development. All unit owners are members of the body corporate. A body corporate can delegate some of its powers and duties to a body corporate committee and a professional body corporate manager may be contracted to provide services.[2]
The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 sets out the rights and responsibilities of residential landlords and tenants, including the requirement to have a written tenancy agreement and the need to lodge tenancy bonds (if one is required) with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment. Commercial leases are covered by the Property Law Act 1952.
Republic of Ireland[edit]
In the Republic of Ireland, there is no legal obligation to form a property management company. However, management companies are generally formed to manage multi-unit developments, and must then follow the general rules of company law in terms of ownership and administration.
Since July 2012, it has become mandatory for all property service providers, including property management companies, to be registered and fully licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority of Ireland.
The National Consumer Agency (NCA) has campaigned in this area, and in September 2008 it launched a website explaining consumer rights. The NCA does not have a legislative or regulatory function in the area, unless a consumer complaint is in relation to a breach of consumer law.
Romania[edit]
No specific regulatory or licensing body exists at this time (November 2012). However, under Financial business law, Any business offering Property Management as a chargeable, fee earning act of commerce may only do so if such services are listed in their Company Acts of Constitutions, i.e., legally pre-declared list of business activities. Under Romanian law, no business can derive income from any such service that is not declared in this way and should be demonstrable upon request by the client of legal entities.
United Kingdom[edit]
In the United Kingdom there is no statutory regulation concerning property management companies. Companies which manage rented residential property are often members of the Association of Residential Letting Agents. Companies or individual landlords who accept tenancy deposits for "assured shorthold tenancies" (the usual form of residential tenancy) are required by statute to be members of a Tenancy Deposit Scheme.
Companies which manage apartment buildings are often members of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA).[3] ARMA is a trade association for firms that manage private residential leasehold blocks of flats in England & Wales. ARMA promotes high standards of leasehold management by providing advice, training and guidance to its member firms of managing agents. ARMA also produces guidance materials for leaseholders and Residents Management Companies. With over 280 firms in membership, ARMA also campaigns for improvements in the legislation governing the leasehold sector.
United States[edit]
Most states, such as New York,[4] Texas,[5] and Colorado,[6] require property management companies to be licensed real estate brokers if they are collecting rent, listing properties for rent or helping negotiate leases and doing inspections as a third-party. A property manager may be a licensed real estate salesperson but generally they must be working under a licensed real estate broker. Most states have a public license check system on-line for anyone holding a real estate salesperson or real estate broker's license.[7] A few states, such as Idaho, Maine, and Vermont do not require property managers to have real estate licenses. Other states, such as Montana, Oregon, and South Carolina, allow property managers to work under a property management license rather than a broker's license.[8]
Owners who manage their own property are not required to have a real estate license in many states; however, they must at least have a business license to rent out their own home. Owners who do not live near the rental property may be required, by local government, to hire the services of a property management company.[citation needed]
In California, third-party apartment property managers must be licensed with the California Bureau of Real Estate as a Real Estate Broker. A broker's license is required for any person or company that, for compensation, leases or rents or offers to lease or rent, or places for rent, or solicits listing of places for rent, or solicits for prospective tenants, or negotiates the sale, purchase or exchanges of leases on real property, or on a business opportunity, or collects rents from real property, or improvements thereon, or from business opportunities.[9] California Code of Regulations, Title 25, section 42, requires property owners of apartment buildings with 16 or more units to have on-site resident managers living on their properties. There is no such requirement for apartment buildings with less than 16 units.[10]
The designation Real Estate Broker is often confused by those unfamiliar with terms of the industry as Realtor, Agent[disambiguation needed], or Salesperson.

Property Management Software[edit]
Property management software continues to grow in popularity and importance. As it decreases in price, smaller companies and amateur property managers are able to function using some of the same best practices and efficiency as larger companies. Online asset management software (OPMS, or online property management software) has been a major cause of the price declines. In addition to the core property management software options, there is a quickly growing number of closely related software products being introduced to the industry.[citation needed]
Business models[edit]
Percentage of rent[edit]
This is the most common model, and is used by property management companies in the residential space that manage multi-home units and single family homes. The property owner in this case signs a property management agreement with the company, giving the latter the right to let it out to new tenants and collect rent. The owners don't usually even know who the tenants are. The property management company usually keeps 10-15% of the rent amount, and shares the rest with the property owner.
Fixed fee[edit]
This is the most common revenue model used by companies when monitoring empty homes or empty land sites. The work here involves monitoring the property and ensuring that it is safe and secure, and reporting back to the owner. As there is no income from these properties, a fixed monthly fee is usually charged to the owner.
Guaranteed rent[edit]
This model is also used in the residential space, but mostly for small units in high demand locations. Here, the company signs a rental agreement with the owner and pays them a fixed rent. As per the agreement, the company is given the right to sublet the property for a higher rent. The company's income is the difference between the two rents. As is evident, in this case, the company minimizes the rent paid to the owner, which is usually lower than market rates.
Revenue share[edit]
This model applies to the service apartment space and other commercial establishments, such as retail or business centers that generate revenue. In this case, the property manager signs an agreement with the property owner, with the right to convert the property into a revenue generating business such as a business center, service apartment, etc. Instead of paying rent to the owner, the management company shares a percentage of revenue.[citation needed] There are also hybrid structures here, where a combination of a fixed rent and a share of revenue is shared with the property owner.[citation needed]

Forming an LLC for Real Estate Investments: Pros & Cons

Forming an LLC for Real Estate Investments: Pros & Cons
by Jeff Weaver, Esq., January 2014





Over the last decade, limited liability companies (LLCs) have become one of the most preferred forms of business entities through which to hold title to investment real estate properties. LLCs did not come into existence in the United States until 1977 when the State of Wyoming enacted special legislation to accommodate the needs of oil companies. Prior to LLCs, real estate investors seeking limited liability protection were largely limited to using corporations to acquire title—a form of entity that has potential drawbacks. Florida followed Wyoming's lead a few years later by enacting its own LLC statute in 1982 and now all 50 states have enacted legislation creating some form of the LLC business structure. The insulation from personal risk exposure for real estate investors provided by LLCs, coupled with the relative ease of administration and potential tax benefits, make ownership of investment property through an LLC a very desirable option in most instances.
LLC vs. Liability Insurance
Although there are many benefits to holding real property assets through an LLC, a limited liability company may not be the best holding vehicle for every property owner. For many real estate investors, the trouble of forming and maintaining a company isn't worth protection from the theoretical threat of a lawsuit, particularly when affordable liability insurance is available.
That said, real estate investors that rely solely on insurance as a means of protection from personal liability take a significant risk. Liability policies typically have limits, exceptions and carve-outs. While the chance of a loss that exceeds policy limits may be remote, if it happens, the consequences can be devastating.
Under current laws and market trends, the popularity of real estate holding LLCs is very likely to continue to increase as more and more property owners seek to take advantage of the benefits offered by this form of entity.
LLCs Limit Personal Liability
First and foremost, LLCs limit personal vulnerability to potential lawsuits related to the property. Consider the situation in which the owner of an investment property leases it to a tenant who decides to throw a big party, during which one of the tenant's guests falls over a balcony. In today's legal climate, it is quite possible that the injured guest would pursue a claim based on the “unsafe condition” of the rental dwelling. More often than not, the owner would be named in any lawsuit resulting from the incident.

If that rental property were owned by a real estate investor individually, he or she would be named in the lawsuit and would have to defend his or her personal assets from the plaintiff's claims. In contrast, if that property were owned by an LLC, the owner's risk exposure would be insulated by the protection of the company, leaving only the assets owned by the LLC (as opposed to all of the owner's personal assets) exposed to potential lawsuits.
Pass-Through Taxation for Single & Multimember LLCs Another advantage of an LLC is the owners' ability to enjoy the benefits of pass-through taxation. In 1988, the IRS released Revenue Ruling 88-76 which declared that Wyoming LLCs would be taxed as partnerships even though they provide for corporate-like protection against liability. C corporations, in contrast, are subject to double taxation—once at the corporate level and again when dividends are distributed to shareholders. While the owners of corporations can achieve pass-through taxation by making an “S” election, S corporations are subject to many other restrictions and requirements that limit their utility in the real estate investment realm. The 1988 revenue ruling was a true game-changer because it enabled real estate investors to avoid double taxation by acquiring property through an LLC while enjoying a liability shield.
Under the default tax classification rules, the IRS classifies a real estate holding company with one owner as they would a sole proprietorship, namely as a “disregarded entity.” As a result, income and capital gains from the LLC pass through directly to the owner, who would only have to pay taxes as an individual, while still enjoying the protections offered by the LLC liability shield.
Since there is no separate LLC tax, the owner can avoid double taxation on both the rental income generated by the property and the appreciation in value of the property upon disposition. Moreover, the owner of a single-member LLC can deduct mortgage interest similar to a sole proprietor based on current IRS rules.
Real estate holding companies that have several owners are known as “multimember” LLCs and are generally taxed by the IRS like partnerships, meaning that the LLC files an “informational” tax return, but does not actually pay taxes itself.
Multimember LLCs also enjoy the benefits of pass-through taxation as the LLC passes its profits and losses through to its members, who report their portion of the LLC's business income or losses on either a Schedule C, K or Form 1065 with their individual income tax returns. This means that both single member and multimember LLCs offer the benefits of pass-through taxation of profits and losses and limited liability and personal protection for the owners.
LLCs Can Make Business Life Easier
LLCs offer numerous other general benefits relative to other entity forms that aren't necessarily unique to—but certainly apply to—the use of LLCs to hold real estate investments.
When delegating management responsibilities, LLCs enjoy much greater flexibility than either a corporation or partnership. While corporations are statutorily required to have officers and directors, the LLC can be easily managed by its owners or third-party managers.
In the many states that impose increased fees based on the authorized number of shares, LLCs may pay lower state registration and maintenance fees than corporations.
Owners of LLCs can take advantage of the tremendous flexibility in the distribution of profits, as determined by the LLC's operating agreement. Cash flow distributions do not have to be pro rata according to ownership like an S corporation, which gives the owners the ability to financially reward the “sweat equity” effort of select members through appropriate distributions of available cash flow.
Unlike an S corporation, foreign ownership and investment in U.S. real estate is possible through an LLC.
LLC owners can also easily transfer their ownership in real estate holdings by proactively gifting the company's membership interests to their heirs each year. Over time, it is entirely possible to effectively pass ownership of real estate owned by an LLC to loved ones without ever having to formally execute and record a new deed. This enables property owners to avoid transfer and recording taxes and fees, which can be substantial in many states.
Although not every company will seek these particular benefits, it's safe to say that LLCs can offer steep rewards to companies that choose to take advantage of them.
Explore Your Options
Many business owners choose to form an LLC because they are unfamiliar with the many legal nuances between different entity choices, and they simply assume that an LLC offers the most protection from risk because it has “limited liability” in its name.
In reality, a properly formed and operated LLC does indeed limit the personal liability of the owners, as much as U.S. law allows, by affording the owners no personal risk above and beyond their investment in the company—but, in many instances, so do corporations and certain partnerships.
Of course if a small business owner of any entity form fails to respect the separate and distinct identity of the business or observe statutorily required corporate formalities (such as co-mingling personal and business funds, paying owners instead of creditors, or failing to maintain a registered agent), the integrity of the corporate shield provided by law will be compromised and potentially expose the owners to personal liability. Generally speaking, though, the basic requirements to operate an LLC within the confines of the corporate statutes are not particularly onerous.
Minimize Risks with the Right Strategy
There is simply no way to eliminate all the risks associated with starting a real estate investment business, but you can easily improve your chances of success by complying with the corporate formalities required by applicable laws, even though these steps may seem tedious and somewhat confusing.
If you are in the market for investment real estate, you should at least consider whether or not the acquisition through an LLC is the right choice for you. If so, it is much easier to purchase the property through the LLC to begin with, as opposed to trying to transfer the real estate to an entity at a later date where a lender might have to consent to the transaction. An LLC may not offer any more or less protection from outside lawsuits than a properly formed and operated corporation or limited liability partnership, but it does offer many other advantages that make it the most desirable form of entity in many cases, particularly with respect to real estate holding companies.

In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

What is Property Management?
Property management—also known as real estate management—encompasses all aspects of running an income property, from finding and screening tenants to maintaining the property, collecting rent, and handling any issues that arise. 
While some professional property managers specialize in certain types of services, most are prepared to take full responsibility for your property—unless you'd prefer to handle certain things yourself. To learn more about the services property management companies offer, read 10 Reasons to Hire a Property Manager.

Why Use a Professional Property Manager?
Professional property management can make owning (and profiting from!) rental properties a hassle-free experience. 
For most, the decision to use a professional real estate manager is a simple cost/benefit equation. Not only are they experts at handling properties and tenants, they generally take only a small percentage of the monthly rent in exchange for their services. When you consider what you get in return—a hassle-free, essentially passive income stream—the decision to employ a professional property manager is a no-brainer for the majority of rental property owners.
While the right property manager can greatly benefit any rental property owner, you might especially want to consider hiring one if any of the following things are true:

You live further than a couple of neighborhoods away from your rental property
You're not a home maintenance guru
You don't have at least 10-12 hours per month to deal with tasks related to your rental property
You don't want to have to make yourself constantly available in case of emergency
You don't have a good working knowledge of landlord-tenant law
You don't ever want to have to worry about dealing with difficult or non-paying tenants

Learn More About Professional Property Management



Do I need a property manager?
As the owner of a small-scale rental property, you may be on the fence about whether or not to use a property management company. Especially if you've never managed an income property, it can be tempting to assume that property management duties amount to "find tenants, sign lease, receive rent check," along with handling some minor maintenance issues from time to time. 
In reality, managing tenant relations, staying on the right side of the law, being on call for any emergencies that come up, staying on top of home maintenance, conducting periodic property inspections, and handling the accounting and taxes can be a time-consuming effort.
Professional property managers have developed systems that allow them to manage all of the above with maximum efficiency. Their expertise allows them to prevent problems before they arise, as well as handle any issues that do come up with minimum disruption to your revenue stream.

Is property management affordable for single-family rental owners?
Not only is property management affordable, using a property manager can actually increase your property's overall profitability. Most property managers charge a small percentage of your monthly rent in exchange for comprehensive services that range from finding and screening tenants, to handling emergency maintenance, to keeping the books and preparing year-end taxes. 
For what usually amounts to $100.00-$200.00 per month, you can outsource all of the responsibilities related to managing your rental property. When you weigh that fee against the 10-15 hours per month you'd likely spend managing the property yourself, not to mention being constantly on-call in case of emergency, the tradeoff becomes pretty clear.
You should also consider that property management companies are experts at preventing vacancies and turnover costs, the two factors that can sink your profit margins almost instantly. As the owner of a single-family rental home, keeping your property filled is especially important---your total revenue is likely generated by a single set of tenants.

How can I find the right property management company for me?
You can take the first step toward finding the right property management company by using All Property Management's search feature to locate the property managers in your area who manage single family homes. We recommend that you speak with two or three companies to determine which company's services, strengths, and fee structure best suit your needs.

Do I need a commercial property manager?
While it may be possible to manage a small commercial property on your own, if you're hoping to expand your portfolio of propertiesor just want to free up your own timehiring a property management company can be a smart, cost-effective investment. 
A commercial property manager can:

Fill vacancies in a timely manner
Maximize the value of your lease agreements
Handle both day-to-day and emergency maintenance
Build and maintain good relationships with tenants
Take care of accounting and provide regular financial statements

No matter what the scale of your commercial property, a professional property management company can help improve your ROI.

What should I look for in a commercial property management company?
Managing commercial properties requires different expertise than the management of residential buildings. While there is some overlap in the skills required, you should look for a property management company that is either specifically dedicated to commercial property management or has a team devoted exclusively to commercial. 
In addition to the skills that residential property managers typically provide, commercial property management firms often also provide asset management, and work with you to ensure that your investment is a profitable one. Specific asset management services typically include analysis of the following:

Investment strategies and development opportunities
Lease proposals
Cash flow and general financials
Risk

Commercial property management companies typically have experience managing multimillion dollar portfolios in addition to providing large scale professional facilities management.

What Does an Apartment Manager Do?



An apartment or duplex building manager handles the day-to-day operations of an apartment complex, whether big or small. While the responsibilities will vary based on the specific needs of the complex’s owners and the agreed upon employment terms with the management company, their duties can include any or all of the following:

Rental Payment: A manager plays two roles, 1) rent enforcer and 2) payment. They will manage collecting rent and use their local knowledge to set the right rental payment levels to attract tenants and get you the most from your investment.
Manage Tenants: From finding tenants to dealing with complaints and evictions, an apartment complex manager handles it all. In addition they screen tenants, negotiate leases, facilitate move-in and move-out inspections and more.
Maintenance & Repair: a building manager handles the physical management of the property, including regular and preventative maintenance, as well as repairs.
Legal Issues: Professional managers know local, state and national laws for screening tenants, handling security deposits, terminating a lease, evicting a tenant, and complying with safety standards.
Budget & Records: The manager must maintain thorough records, including income and expenses, inspections, leases, maintenance requests, complaints, repairs, rent collection, insurance and can help with taxes for the property.


Any tips on hiring the RIGHT property manager?
Here is a great checklist for finding a capable apartment or duplex complex manager:

Proven Profit: A track record of profitably managing complexes
Reviews: A strong background in customer service and former tenant reviews
Assistance: A crew of maintenance professionals or relationships with local vendors
Planning: Detailed, computerized accounting and seasonal maintenance tracking systems
Licensed: Professional certifications or licenses from trade organizations such as: the Institute of Real Estate Management, National Apartment Association, National Association of Residential Property Managers and the Community Associations Institute.



Do I really need an apartment building management company?
The more tenants you have the higher volume of complaints, maintenance issues, and vacancies you will need to deal with. It is in your best interest to employ a manager to quickly respond to emergencies and collect the rent on time.
Apartment building managers have professional knowledge to assist you with hiring and managing local vendors, keeping current with local, state and federal housing laws, maintaining low vacancy rates, and dealing with sensitive tenant issues such as evictions. 

How can I easily find a property manager?
At All Property Management, we make it easy to find the right apartment complex manager for your rental property, whether you’re looking for someone to manage a few apartments and townhomes, a large apartment complex, commercial property – or a portfolio that includes all these and more. Just select the property type and fill in your rental’s zip code to generate an instant list of apartment building managers in your area. For best results, we recommend interviewing at least two or three companies to find the one that is best suited for your needs.

Please contact us via the management interest form, phone or email to discuss what we can do for your association.Short and Long Term Goal Planning.  With the input of the Board of Directors, Committees of the Association, the Reserve Study professional, and the Association’s CPA, we will develop a plan to address the Short and Long Term Goals of the Association, including immediate Action Items.
Develop Annual Corporate Calendar.  With the Board of Directors input, we will develop an Annual Corporate Calendar to reflect actions to be taken by the Association throughout the year. Maintain Vital Records.  Miramonte maintains, in our office, at least twelve (12) months of “current files,” including architectural control files, contracts, correspondence, bids, insurance information, etc. We would establish, if not already set up, a file for each unit/lot.Fiscal Budget Management.  Miramonte will work with the Board and with the Reserve Study professionals in preparing the fiscal budget. We will obtain updated vendor prices for the forthcoming year and plan for upcoming maintenance. The budget package distributed to the members includes a cover letter with applicable disclosure information, the Budget, Reserve Study Summary, Assessment Collection Policy, Meeting Minutes statement, Alternative Dispute Resolution policy, Internal Dispute Resolution policy, Architectural Guidelines, Monetary Fine policy, Insurance Disclosure information and any other materials and/or information that must be disclosed to the membership as required by the Board and Civil Code. Board of Directors Meetings.  Miramonte will prepare and deliver a Directors package no less than five (5) days prior to the meeting.

We would utilize the newsletter (which we recommend be distributed to the tenants as well) and the Association's website to provide members with any amendments or additions to the Rules & Regulations. We recommend legal counsel review any new policies developed or amended (i.e. updated Architectural Guidelines, Assessment Collection Policy, Monetary Penalty/Fine Policy, Satellite/Antennae Policy, Recreational Policy, etc.), prior to distribution to the homeowners.Site Review & Reports.  We will prepare a Site Review that we would tailor to the Association’s needs. Our site review includes applicable follow up of any maintenance needs and/or non-compliance issues.
Architectural Review Processing.  We would review all submissions to the Architectural Committee/Board to ensure that all applications are complete and as much information as possible is provided. Once a decision is made, we would send a letter to the homeowner as to any approvals, conditions or resubmittals necessary.Board of Directors Training.  Miramonte hosts Board of Directors training sessions for new Boards, at which we review the responsibilities of the Board, review the governing documents of the Association, discuss recent litigation, how to read a financial statement and much more!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
