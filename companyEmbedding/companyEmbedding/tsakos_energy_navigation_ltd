    Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd

	The Tsakos Group pioneered the introduction of Greek shipping companies into global equity markets. Senior management foresaw, since the late 1980s, the role that international capital markets would play in the development of the global maritime industry. Thus, on the initiative of Nikolas Tsakos- and with the support of his family and colleagues - the first public arm of the Group was established in 1993 under the name of Maritime Investment Fund Ltd (MIF Ltd). In the subsequent years and following its strong growth performance, MIF Ltd succeeded in its bid to list in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the brand name of “Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd (TEN)”.

	Since its inception, Tsakos Energy Navigation Ltd has had an exceptionally successful record of growth and ranks as one of the largest transporters of energy in the world, controlling a versatile fleet of more than 50 modern crude, oil and product tankers, LNGs and shuttle tankers of a young age. It has also become one of the largest ice-class tanker operators in the world listing, among its clientele, state entities, international oil majors and major oil traders.

	TEN’s vision is to maintain its leading position as an international seaborne trade transporter of energy. This is being accomplished by the company’s substantial investment in its fleet expansion, which presently comprises a modern, high quality and technologically state of the art fleet of VLCC, Suezmax, Aframax, Panamax, Handysize and Handymax Tankers, as well as LNG and Shuttle tankers.

	Long-term sustainable growth and stability throughout the industry's cycles, is maintained through a well-balanced employment strategy. Furthermore, the company gains significant commercial leverage from its association with Tsakos Shipping and Trading S.A. capitalizing on synergies of the Tsakos Group’s expertise, long term established commercial relations and reputation. Tsakos Shipping and Trading S.A. acts as the exclusive commercial managers for TEN. Considerable economy of scale benefits are realized through Tsakos Columbia Shipmanagement (“TCM”) S.A., a joint venture between the Tsakos Group and  Hamburg based Schoeller Group, acting as the Technical Manager for the Group's Fleet.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
