         Lite Access Provides Operational Updates

VANCOUVER, Jul 13, 2017 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- LITE ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES INC. (the "Company") (LTE)(otc pink:LTCCF), a world leader in fibre optic products and advanced installation methodologies, is pleased to provide an update on the current operational activities of the Company.  Since closing the $20.45 million bough deal financing on March 28, 2017, the Company is executing on its accelerated growth plan, focusing on training and equipping employees as well as further streamlining "The Lite Access Way" for both trunk and FTTP connectivity in both the UK and Ireland. Having successfully demonstrated "The Lite Access Way" to a major network operator and continuing to build out networks on a daily basis, Lite Access UK's method of construction has become a recommended and preferred method in numerous cities and councils.  With "Project Lightning's" mandate to connect 17 million homes and businesses, Lite Access UK has focused on engaging new operators and construction companies for potential alliances and opportunities in support of build out in the UK.  "We are fully engaged and progressing towards fulfilling obligations for strengthening our business relationships with large organizations and ware working towards successfully satisfying the criteria and procedures required to move to the next stage," said Mike Plotnikoff, CEO of Lite Access. "With recent announcements from major network operators not meeting schedules and expectations as well as new entrants into the UK market, combined with a positive response to our proven micro / narrow trenching processes, Lite Access is in the best position possible and we are making strong progress in achieving our growth plan."  United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland  Lite Access UK Ltd. successfully opened its new office in Wrexham, Wales (pictured). In attendance with Managing Director of Lite Access UK, Dylan Griffiths, was Member of Parliament the Right Honourable Ian Lucas, a strong advocate for the Company. The Wrexham location will serve as the head office and the Company expects to set up satellite offices in areas outside this region based on new and identified locations for clients fibre deployments.  Lite Access UK continues to work in the Wrexham area and has also returned to Ireland to assist with additional training and certification for builds that have recently been announced. Since closing the $20.45 million bought deal financing (press released March 28, 2017), the number of employees has expanded to 65 with an expectation of having to increase further hire and training to support the growing list of new entrants as well as additional builds being identified on a constant basis. To be able to respond immediately to new fibre builds and network extensions, the training program enables teams to be cross-trained in both FTTP as well as trunk deployments.  Following the successful FTTH trial in Tullamore (press release dated April 11, 2017), Lite Access UK has returned to the Republic of Ireland to train additional crews with the expectation of potentially taking part in further fibre rollouts. Discussions are underway with several potential clients, however, no announcement is expected until all due diligence has been conducted and impact studies performed and analyzed.  Mr. Plotnikoff added, "In the UK and elsewhere we have witnessed the limitations of contractors using conventional means and capital-intensive equipment with large crews. They can achieve only a fraction of what Lite Access can complete using crews of only 4-6 and its specialized equipment and proven processes." Mr. Plotnikoff continued, "Pioneering and maintaining our focus on micro/narrow trench and alternate deployment methods for the past 13 years has enabled us with the most cost effective and efficient process possible. Having our core competencies in alternate fibre deployment methodologies as well as continually working on further advancements gives us strategic advantages in the marketplace.  "The large-diversified construction and infrastructure entities, which use large and expensive equipment as well as large workforces necessary for traditional construction, are experiencing criticism over the quality of their work due to high number of defects when using conventional equipment and processes," added Mr. Plotnikoff. "Like putting a square peg in a round hole when using large equipment and huge work crews to perform what only requires the 'Lite Access Way'."  Western Canada  Lite Access is increasing operations in the Kootenay region of British Columbia and locally in support of ongoing network expansion projects and the much anticipated release of Federal and Provincial Government funding assigned for many tenders the Company has been engaged in from the very beginning Lite Access is also pleased to report that it is operating at the highest safety standards in the industry, recently attaining 96% on the last set of tests for its Certificate of Recognition (COR) certification versus the BC Construction Safety Alliance (BCCSA) average of 88% achieved by companies.  The first narrow trench project for the City of New Westminster, British Columbia (press releases dated February 9 and March 29, 2017), encompassing backbone application with high fibre count at a new 24" depth, was recently completed using the Company's new and modified cutting equipment. The next generation of Lite Access' narrow trench machinery arrived at its Langley, British Columbia headquarters last week, the first in Canada and believed to be the first of its kind in North America. This new trencher will now enable a 5" cut by 36" deep at speeds equivalent to the Company's micro-trench equipment and at costs far less than conventional construction methods.  Mr. Plotnikoff, said, "Being flexible in our approach and commitment to evolving as necessary for the ever-changing industry, Lite Access remains significantly ahead of the competition. Now able to satisfy depths ranging from the recommended and preferred 12" to now 36" empowers Lite Access with an advantage over all others trying to enter into this growing industry of alternate deployments methodologies."  South Africa  Lite Access has received a purchase order valued at over CDN $200,000 from its South Africa partner Brite Access SA for the LiteXTend last mile solution. To support network expansion efforts, Brite Access was first required to hire and train additional crews in response to satisfying major operators criteria for construction partners. Now that Brite Access has increased its capacity by adding trained crews and equipment for micro-trench projects in South Africa, the Company expects to receive additional orders from this partner.  Ongoing Expansion Plans  In eastern Canada, Lite Access recently attended the Municipal Information Systems Association (MISA) conference and met with Municipalities interested in building their own fibre optic infrastructure. In addition, the Company plans on expanding into the United States. A new US Sales VP, Gary Stahlbrand, possessing extensive experience and industry contacts was recently hired to pursue opportunities in this strong and growing market.  "We are currently in the process of developing strategic alliances with construction partners that will help support our expansion initiatives into these territories using our proven technologies. Adding new teams of Lite Access certified and trained construction partners is an integral part of our growth strategy," said Mr. Plotnikoff.  About Lite Access  Lite Access is a world leader in Microduct and fibre optic technologies. Using its specially designed and innovative micro / narrow trench and alternate methods of deployment, Lite Access' proprietary Microduct technology extends a network provider's ability to deliver true broadband connectivity directly to end-users, such as homes, government and educational institutions, and emergency response facilities.

Access Lighting FixturesBased on the belief that contemporary design need not be expensive, Access Lighting fixtures were introduced to the market more than two decades ago. Holding affordable price points and cutting edge design as its twin hallmarks, Access Lighting has provided consumers across the nation with ceiling fixtures, sconces and outdoor wall lights that adhere to the highest aesthetic standards. And because each Access fixture is designed to meet the rigors of commercial use, consumers can shop a wide selection of residential lighting that's certain to hold up to daily use. For great design at an even better price, look no further than Access.

Decorating with Wall Light Fixtures

    You may look to them for the function they fulfill, but decorative wall light fixtures are perfect for styling and sprucing up any room in the house, from the hall to the bedroom. Wall lights come in a variety of forms and finishes. Choose contemporary sconces in the hallway as a modern replacement to tired looking fixtures. In the bedroom, consider flanking the bed for a comfortable look that keeps your bed stands clutter-free.
    
    Installing indoor wall lighting fixtures can be a snap. Homeowners can choose from standard, hard-wire designs that must be wired to a wall junction box, or easy-to-install plug-in models. When it's time to shop the best designs for your needs, start by assessing your space, electrical outlets and lines, and plan accordingly. We offer 1000's of affordable designs to brighten your décor. For product questions or wall light recommendations to best fit your specific needs, please call us to speak to a trained lighting associate.

What's the correct chandelier size?Decide where the chandelier is going to be installed to determine the size you need. Once you know that, use the following guidelines:In a Dining Room: the simple sizing rule is that your chandelier should be about 12 inches narrower than the dining table surface.The design should also have at least 4 feet of distance from the room walls. Following these guidelines will give you a chandelier that will appear to fill the space without overcrowding it.In a Living Room or Entryway: for every foot of ceiling height allow 2-3 inches in chandelier height. For example, a 9-foot ceiling would require a 27-inch high design. To determine the width needed, add the length and width of your room and convert the total to inches. For example, a room that's 12-feet x 14-feet would require a design that's around 26-inches wide (12 plus 14 gives you the width of 26).How to hang a chandelierFinding the correct chandelier height can be problematic unless you know the dimensions of the room. Use the following guidelines to help you through the process.When hanging over a dining room table, for an 8-foot standard ceiling, the bottom of the chandelier should hang thirty to thirty-four inches over the table.Add three inches more for each additional foot of ceiling height.If you are hanging a large chandelier or one that is very heavy, we suggest using a joist brace above the junction box to help carry the weight. You may wish to consult a professional electrician for such an installation.For traditional designs, you can add a decorative cord or chain cover to dress up the final look.When hanging a chandelier with a chain, trim the chain to the hang height required. Do the same with pendants that hang from a cord. Landings and entryways usually have high ceilings that are perfect for tall chandeliers; hang these so there is a minimum 8-foot clearance.Remember that the higher a design hangs, the smaller it looks, so go with a larger size if thes space is large.Chandeliers brands and optionsLamps Plus offers a wide selection of chandeliers, including top quality brands such as Schonbek, James Moder and Vienna Full Spectrum.
