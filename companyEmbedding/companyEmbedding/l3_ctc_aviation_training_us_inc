      aftermarket solutions and training, to encompass a growing portfolio of 
      airline and third-party training company customers. L-3 CTC has 
      approximately 265 employees. L-3 CTC forecasts sales for the years 
      ending December 31, 2015 and 2016, of $86 million and $95 million, 
      respectively, and is expected to add approximately $50 million to L-3’s 
      sales for the year ending December 31, 2015. L-3 CTC is a high-margin 
      business that is expected to generate operating margins that generally 
      exceed those of the Electronic Systems segment as a whole.
    

      “This acquisition is a very good fit with our strategy of expanding our 
      international and commercial presence by focusing on higher-margin 
      businesses with number one or two positions in the markets we serve,” 
      said Michael T. Strianese, L-3’s chairman, president and chief executive 
      officer. “L-3 CTC has a worldwide reputation for excellence and 
      strengthens our Link Simulation & Training and Link UK businesses with 
      value-added synergies for total training solutions across a wide range 
      of military and commercial platforms. This addition will solidify L-3’s 
      position as a global leader in commercial flight simulation and 
      training, while delivering value to our customers and shareholders.”
    

      L-3 CTC and L-3 Link UK will retain their individual brands and 
      strengths as independent operational entities, while continuing to focus 
      on and serve their existing customers and markets. The synergistic 
      collaboration of these two businesses enables new and innovative 
      approaches to vertically integrated training, resourcing and simulation 
      solutions. The business portfolio will span the entire spectrum of 
      customer needs, delivering unique and innovative capabilities, an 
      unmatched value proposition, and a strong emphasis on customer service.
    

      “Driven by a focus on the customer, quality, service and safety, this 
      new partnership of world-class training devices and training delivery 
      places L-3 Link UK and L-3 CTC in the unique position to provide 
      customers with totally scalable training solutions whatever their 
      requirements,” said Alan Crawford, managing director of L-3 Link UK. 
      “This acquisition also enables L-3 to build on strategic partnerships 
      with key growth airlines in an environment where a global shortage of 
      pilot training resources and increased pilot demand are driving the 
      growing need for tailored pilot training solutions. We look forward to 
      working very closely with L-3 CTC to bring to our customers the unique 
      propositions that can only be delivered by a customer-focused training 
      and resourcing solutions company.”
    

      L-3 CTC will be integrated into the Precision Engagement & Training 
      sector, which is part of L-3’s Electronic Systems segment.
    

      Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 45,000 people 
      worldwide and is a prime contractor in aerospace systems and national 
      security solutions. L-3 is also a leading provider of a broad range of 
      communication and electronic systems and products used on military and 
      commercial platforms. The company reported 2014 sales of $12.1 billion.

NEW YORK, 29 May 2015. L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) has acquired CTC Aviation Group in the United Kingdom (U.K.) for £143 million (approximately $220 million).

07/07/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 07/07/2016 14:33
L-3 Announces Formation of Commercial Training Solutions Division








- Consolidation Creates Seamless Aviation Training Business to Address Global Market -


        NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jul. 7, 2016-- L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) announced today the formation of its new Commercial Training Solutions division. The new business, which is part of the Precision Engagement & Training sector within L-3 Electronic Systems, has been created through the consolidation of L-3's leading global flight simulator manufacturer, L-3 Link UK, and its global airline pilot training and resourcing organization, L-3 CTC Aviation.
      

        'By bringing together these two world-class performers, L-3 now offers a seamless, one-stop shop that provides customized and affordable solutions to support the global commercial aviation training marketplace,' said Steve Kantor, president of L-3 Electronic Systems. 'Given the global pilot shortage and the growing need for pilot training at all proficiency levels, we are now optimally positioned to serve this market with our technical expertise and leading innovative products and capabilities, which will help us capture key synergies, grow our customer base, and expand our product and service portfolio.'
      

        This singular division has been specifically created to meet current and emerging market requirements and drive continued efficiencies. It has a global offering that spans the complete spectrum of Commercial Aviation Training, with services that encompass selection, cadet (ab initio) training, resourcing and airline training (including recurrent, type rating and command training) - all supported by high-technology simulation products such as the RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.
      

        CTC Aviation and Link UK have been collaborating since the acquisition of CTC Aviation by L-3 in May 2015. This dynamic team effort resulted in the successful establishment of a training facility at London's Gatwick Airport (U.K.) that houses L-3 RealitySeven training devices for both Boeing and Airbus aircraft to support a variety of customers. It also yielded a highly successful partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to provide a B787 training and instructional capability (via CTC Aviation instructors) on a Link UK B787 RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.
      

        As a part of this consolidation, the existing training portfolio of Link UK has been aligned with CTC Aviation's airline training business. This includes the company's leading training facility in Bangkok- the Asian Aviation Training Centre (AATC) - which has recently expanded from six to eight full flight simulators.
      

        Alan Crawford, president of L-3 Commercial Training Solutions, said, 'L-3 Commercial Training Solutions offers a comprehensive, value-added portfolio to deliver uniquely targeted solutions that meet our customers' total scope of training, resourcing and simulation needs. We are committed to building on the strengths that will continue to support our customers in the future. Our agility, our drive to innovate and our firm belief in developing ongoing partnerships will enable us to consistently exceed expectations.'
      

        L-3 Commercial Training Solutions is located in Crawley, U.K., and includes L-3 Link UK, L-3 CTC Aviation and L-3 CTC Private Jet. It is a world leader in providing intelligent total training solutions for pilots and maintainers across a wide range of commercial platforms. L-3 Commercial Training Solutions provides a full spectrum of state-of-the-art training solutions, including ab initio training, airline training, training centers and high-fidelity simulation products. The company has delivered commercial training solutions to customer locations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and the Pacific Rim.
      

        Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 38,000 people worldwide and is a leading provider of a broad range of communication and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial platforms. L-3 is also a prime contractor in aerospace systems. The company reported 2015 sales of $10.5 billion.
      

        To learn more about L-3, please visit the company's website at www.L-3com.com. L-3 uses its website as a channel of distribution of material company information. Financial and other material information regarding L-3 is routinely posted on the company's website and is readily accessible.

L-3 Announces Formation Of Commercial Training Solutions Division






Business Wire




Jul 7, 2016 4:03 PM EDT













 




























































  L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) announced today the formation of its new Commercial Training Solutions division. The new business, which is part of the Precision Engagement & Training sector within L-3 Electronic Systems, has been created through the consolidation of L-3's leading global flight simulator manufacturer, L-3 Link UK, and its global airline pilot training and resourcing organization, L-3 CTC Aviation.  "By bringing together these two world-class performers, L-3 now offers a seamless, one-stop shop that provides customized and affordable solutions to support the global commercial aviation training marketplace," said Steve Kantor, president of L-3 Electronic Systems. "Given the global pilot shortage and the growing need for pilot training at all proficiency levels, we are now optimally positioned to serve this market with our technical expertise and leading innovative products and capabilities, which will help us capture key synergies, grow our customer base, and expand our product and service portfolio."  This singular division has been specifically created to meet current and emerging market requirements and drive continued efficiencies. It has a global offering that spans the complete spectrum of Commercial Aviation Training, with services that encompass selection, cadet (ab initio) training, resourcing and airline training (including recurrent, type rating and command training) - all supported by high-technology simulation products such as the RealitySeven ™ Full Flight Simulator.  CTC Aviation and Link UK have been collaborating since the acquisition of CTC Aviation by L-3 in May 2015. This dynamic team effort resulted in the successful establishment of a training facility at London's Gatwick Airport (U.K.) that houses L-3 RealitySeven training devices for both Boeing and Airbus aircraft to support a variety of customers. It also yielded a highly successful partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to provide a B787 training and instructional capability (via CTC Aviation instructors) on a Link UK B787 RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.

L-3 Announces Formation of Commercial Training Solutions Division




– Consolidation Creates Seamless Aviation Training Business to 
      Address Global Market –






July 07, 2016 04:03 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--L-3 Communications (NYSE:LLL) announced today the formation of its new 
      Commercial Training Solutions division. The new business, which is part 
      of the Precision Engagement & Training sector within L-3 Electronic 
      Systems, has been created through the consolidation of L-3’s leading 
      global flight simulator manufacturer, L-3 Link UK, and its global 
      airline pilot training and resourcing organization, L-3 CTC Aviation.
    


      “By bringing together these two world-class performers, L-3 now offers a 
      seamless, one-stop shop that provides customized and affordable 
      solutions to support the global commercial aviation training 
      marketplace,” said Steve Kantor, president of L-3 Electronic Systems. 
      “Given the global pilot shortage and the growing need for pilot training 
      at all proficiency levels, we are now optimally positioned to serve this 
      market with our technical expertise and leading innovative products and 
      capabilities, which will help us capture key synergies, grow our 
      customer base, and expand our product and service portfolio.”
    

      This singular division has been specifically created to meet current and 
      emerging market requirements and drive continued efficiencies. It has a 
      global offering that spans the complete spectrum of Commercial Aviation 
      Training, with services that encompass selection, cadet (ab initio) 
      training, resourcing and airline training (including recurrent, type 
      rating and command training) – all supported by high-technology 
      simulation products such as the RealitySeven™ Full Flight 
      Simulator.
    

      CTC Aviation and Link UK have been collaborating since the acquisition 
      of CTC Aviation by L-3 in May 2015. This dynamic team effort resulted in 
      the successful establishment of a training facility at London’s Gatwick 
      Airport (U.K.) that houses L-3 RealitySeven training devices for both 
      Boeing and Airbus aircraft to support a variety of customers. It also 
      yielded a highly successful partnership with Virgin Atlantic Airways to 
      provide a B787 training and instructional capability (via CTC Aviation 
      instructors) on a Link UK B787 RealitySeven Full Flight Simulator.
    

      As a part of this consolidation, the existing training portfolio of Link 
      UK has been aligned with CTC Aviation’s airline training business. This 
      includes the company’s leading training facility in Bangkok – the 
      Asian Aviation Training Centre (AATC) – which has recently 
      expanded from six to eight full flight simulators.
    

      Alan Crawford, president of L-3 Commercial Training Solutions, said, 
      “L-3 Commercial Training Solutions offers a comprehensive, value-added 
      portfolio to deliver uniquely targeted solutions that meet our 
      customers’ total scope of training, resourcing and simulation needs. We 
      are committed to building on the strengths that will continue to support 
      our customers in the future. Our agility, our drive to innovate and our 
      firm belief in developing ongoing partnerships will enable us to 
      consistently exceed expectations.”
    

      L-3 Commercial Training Solutions is located in Crawley, U.K., and 
      includes L-3 Link UK, L-3 CTC Aviation and L-3 CTC Private Jet. It is a 
      world leader in providing intelligent total training solutions for 
      pilots and maintainers across a wide range of commercial platforms. L-3 
      Commercial Training Solutions provides a full spectrum of 
      state-of-the-art training solutions, including ab initio training, 
      airline training, training centers and high-fidelity simulation 
      products. The company has delivered commercial training solutions to 
      customer locations throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, the 
      Middle East and the Pacific Rim.
    

      Headquartered in New York City, L-3 employs approximately 38,000 people 
      worldwide and is a leading provider of a broad range of communication 
      and electronic systems and products used on military and commercial

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
