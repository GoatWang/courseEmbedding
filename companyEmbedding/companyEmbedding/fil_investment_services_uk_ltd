Eligibility requirements




You can apply for Global Investment Centre if you:

are aged 18 or over
are a UK resident with a permanent UK residential address

You cannot apply for a Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio if you're a non-UK resident (including if you are a UK Crown Servant working overseas).
Accounts cannot be held in joint names and non-personal accounts are not permitted. 
If you would like to invest with another person, or to make regular contributions rather than investing a lump sum, please call 03456 076180* to discuss your options.






Please read the important information below

Global Investment Centre has been created for individual investors who want to make lump sum investments themselves. You cannot make regular payments or joint applications in to the Global Investment Centre.
Investors should regularly review the funds they've chosen. That's why with Global Investment Centre you can see the current value of your investments, and track their performance, at a glance.
Once you've applied for the Global Investment Centre, you can open a Funds Portfolio in which to buy, sell and hold your investments. 
You can also apply for an ISA Funds Portfolio so you can hold your investments within a tax-efficient ISA.
The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100. 
Online trades through the Global Investment Centre are limited to £99,999. If you would like to place a trade of £100,000 or more, you may do so by phone – please call us on 03456 076180**.

It is important to remember

You need to have an HSBC current or savings account to buy funds via our Global Investment Centre. 
The Global Investment Centre is offered without advice, on an execution only basis. HSBC is not required to assess the suitability of this service for you, which means that the protection offered by the Financial Conduct Authority's rules on assessing suitability will not apply.

Investing through our Global Investment Centre involves taking some investment risk. The value of investments can go down as well as up and you may get back less than you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.

More details/FAQs


How it works


Once you've registered for the Global Investment Centre, you can open a Funds Portfolio in which to buy, sell and hold your investments.
You can also apply for an ISA Funds Portfolio so you can hold your investments within a tax-efficient ISA.
There are no new passwords to remember because you access your Global Investment Centre through Internet Banking. Simply log on and select 'Investments'.
You can see the current value of your investment and track its performance online.
Interactive research tools help you make informed decisions about what to invest in and when.
Anyone with an HSBC current or savings account can register for our Global Investment Centre.
Global Investment Centre integrates seamlessly with your nominated bank account as the money for your purchases and the proceeds from your sales will be taken from and paid into that account.
You can choose to buy, sell or switch funds either online or by phone. Please note that purchases or sales you make from 4pm onwards on a business day will be processed the following business day. The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.
Please note online trades through the Global Investment Centre are limited to £99,999. If you would like to place a trade of £100,000 or more, please call us on 03456 076180**.




How much does it cost?


There is no charge for setting up the Global Investment Centre service.
An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds.
There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre.
An annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
In the past fund managers, including HSBC, have used several different methods to illustrate charges. To make these charges clearer and comparisons simpler for you, we’re moving to the Ongoing Charges Figure (OCF), which is being adopted throughout the investment fund industry. The OCF incorporates the Annual Management Charge (AMC) as well as any other additional charges from the fund provider.
Full details of the annual management charge and any other expenses (including the Account Fee) are available in the Key Features of Funds Portfolio and ISA Funds Portfolio Document. Specific fund charges are available in the relevant Key Investor Information Documents for each fund.




What types of funds can I hold?


There is a wide range of open ended investment company (OEIC) and unit trust clean share class funds that you can hold within each of your account(s).




What are the charges?


An Account Fee of 0.39% per annum applies when investing in clean share class funds. There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment Centre; however an annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
The Account Fee will be charged as an annual percentage rate and calculated using the value of any holdings in clean share classes within your account. The annual percentage rate for the Account Fee will be 0.39% per annum. The charge will be taken on a monthly basis from your default settlement account for your Funds Portfolio in arrears. The Account Fee will be payable by you for the services we provide when arranging the sale and purchase of fund shares in clean share classes as well as custody and administration of those fund shares when they are held in your account.
Full details of charges, including annual management charges and any other expenses are available in the Key Features Document and the individual Fund Details.




Is there a minimum amount that I have to invest?


The minimum initial investment is £100 for each class of fund shares for each portfolio. The minimum additional investment is also £100.




What happens after I have placed a buy instruction?


If a Buy instruction is placed prior to the dealing deadline (for individual dealing deadlines please see the Fund Details Document for the specific fund) then your order will normally be placed with the fund provider before the fund's next valuation point. The valuation point for each fund is shown in the Fund Details.
You can then view the status of an instruction by clicking on 'Details' located within the 'My order status' section. Once we receive confirmation that the instruction has been executed by the fund provider, your new holding will be reflected within 'My fund portfolio' section. When you place a Buy instruction a hold will be placed on the required monies in your chosen settlement account or in the case of your ISA this will be the Uninvested cash account. The money will be taken from your settlement account or your Uninvested cash account on settlement day.
We will send you a confirmation of the number of fund shares purchased for you and the price you paid.




Can I make regular contributions to a fund or make a joint application?


No. We don't currently offer this service for Global Investment Centre. However, you may invest as often as you like subject to the minimum investment amount of £100 for each fund for each account.








Investment risk
All investments carry some risk. The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.


Time commitment
Most investments should be considered as a medium to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.


Tax benefits
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.

Our top 5 FAQs

What types of funds can I hold?


What types of funds can I hold?
There is a range of open ended investment company (OEIC) and unit trust funds that you can hold within each of your account(s).
You can view the range of funds available using the 'Research funds' section within the Global Investment Centre or alternatively, they can be viewed at http://investments.hsbc.co.uk/funds/entry
You can refer to the Fund Details to provide you with more information about each fund including their investment objectives and the specific risks associated with each fund to help you make your selection.

The value of investments (and any income received from them) can fall as well as rise and you may not get back what you invested. For some investments this can also happen as a result of exchange rate fluctuations as shares and funds may have an exposure to overseas markets.
Most investments should be considered as a medium- to long-term commitment, meaning you should be prepared to hold them for at least five years.
Some have a fixed term or may not be accessible until you reach your retirement age. For products with a fixed term you may get back significantly less than originally invested if you make an early withdrawal.
The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.




Is there a charge to open a Funds Portfolio and/or an ISA Funds Portfolio within the Global Investment Centre?


Is there a charge to open a Funds Portfolio and/or an ISA Funds Portfolio within the Global Investment Centre?
There is no initial charge on any funds in the Global Investment centre, however an annual management charge and other expenses will apply.
Full details of charges, including annual management charges and any other expenses are available in the Key Features Document and the individual Funds Details documents.

The value of any tax benefits described depends on your individual circumstances. Tax rules may change in the future.




What happens after I have placed a buy instruction?


What happens after I have placed a buy instruction?
If a Buy instruction is placed prior to the dealing deadline (for individual dealing deadlines please see the Fund Details Document for the specific fund) then your order will normally be placed with the fund provider before the fund's next valuation point. The valuation point for each fund is shown in the Fund Details.
You can then view the status of an instruction by clicking on 'Details' located within the 'My order status' section. Once we receive confirmation that the instruction has been executed by the fund provider, your new holding will be reflected within 'My funds portfolio' section. When you place a Buy instruction a hold will be placed on the required monies in your chosen settlement account or in the case of your ISA this will be the Uninvested cash account. The money will be taken from your settlement account or your Uninvested cash account on settlement day.
We will send you a confirmation of the number of fund shares purchased for you and the price you paid.
