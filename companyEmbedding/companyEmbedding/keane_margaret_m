Early life and education[edit]
Keane was raised in New York City, where her father was a police officer. His expectation for his six children[3] was to follow in his footsteps into law enforcement. All of Margaret's five siblings did just that, either themselves or marrying someone in law enforcement, but she decided instead to attend St. John’s University in Queens, New York, where she earned a BA in government and politics in 1981 and her MBA in 1987.[2][3]
Career[edit]
In 1980, when in college, she took a part-time job as a telephone debt collector at CitiCorp for $5.50 per hour.[2] During the following 16 years Keane climbed the ranks at CitiCorp until she was running their US retail operations. She then joined GE Capital. In 2011 she became the CEO of the firm's credit-card business, after filling several different capacities in operations and quality control, and finally in the credit card division.[2]
In 1996 Keane moved to GE and worked as Quality Leader for GE Capital’s Vendor Financial Services (VFS) division. Keane served as Chief Quality Leader of GECC from January 2000 until December 2001. In 2002 she joined GE Consumer Finance-Americas where she was Senior Vice President for Operations. Keane joined GE Capital Retail Consumer Finance in May, 2004. There she led the retail credit business. She was CEO and President of GE’s Retail Card platform for their North American retail finance business from June 2004 until April 2011. In 2005 Keane was named as a GE Officer. On November 29, 2005 she was named the chief executive officer and president of Retail Consumer Finance of Americas Operations at GE. Since April 2011 Keane served as the CEO and president of GE’s North American retail finance business.[1]
In July 2014 GE Capital led Synchrony, a new independent company, which was now the largest private-label credit card provider in the US.[4] With the launch of Synchrony Keane became one of only two women CEOs running US-owned, independent, publicly traded banks valued at over $10 billion.[2]
Recognition and honors[edit]
In the October 2011 issue of American Banker magazine, Keane was recognized as the 15th of 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance.[5] In 2012 her alma mater, St. John’s University, honored her with the Alumni Outstanding Achievement Award.[3]
Volunteer work[edit]
Keane is associated with “A Better Chance,” an organization that helps young minority students improve their chances of getting a better education and a real shot at going to college.[3]

Margaret D. H. Keane (born Peggy Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927)[1] is an American artist. Creator of the "big-eyed waifs", Keane is famous for drawing paintings with big eyes, and mainly paints women, children and animals in oil or mixed media. While the work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates and cups, it has been critically dismissed as kitsch. One reviewer pointed to its ubiquity in discount stores: "They hung in Woolworth's, next to the velvet Elvi, or maybe it was Walgreen's, by the clowns."[2] The work was originally attributed to Keane's husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after an in-court "paint-off" in Hawaii.[2] A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic Big Eyes. She maintains a gallery in San Francisco which boasts "the largest collection of Margaret Keane's art in the entire world."[3] In light of the great gulf between her work's popularity and its critical lampooning, she has been called the "Wayne Newton of the art world."[4]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Keane was born in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them.[5]
Keane started drawing as a child and at the age of 10 took a few classes at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville.[6][7] Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane still has the painting today.[8] She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings.
At the age of 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year.[9][10] She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits.[9] Margaret early began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and oil-based paints, but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).[11]
Career with Walter Keane[edit]
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a "well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes.[12] At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side.[13] He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his "highly successful real estate career" in 1947.[14] Margaret found him "suave, gregarious and charming."[13] The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.[15]
Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic "big eyes" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work.[13] The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco.[16] When she discovered his deception, she remained silent. She later explained her behavior: "I was afraid of him because he [threatened] to have me done in if I said anything."[13] But Margaret even publicly acknowledged him as the artist, while later claiming it was "tortuous" for her. She rationalized the situation on the ground that "[a]t least they were being shown."[17]
In 1957 Walter began exhibiting the "big eyes" paintings as his own. In February the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito.[18] He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claims to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another an a small East Side gallery for the same month.[19]
Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of "The Painting Keanes."[17]
In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."[20] On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times's art critic expressed outrage, calling it "[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair." He described Keane as a painter celebrated "for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane."[21] Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair.
During this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband, Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her paintings.[22] At the height of the artworks' popularity, she was painting non-stop for 16 hours a day.[8]
Career after Walter Keane[edit]
In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a "paint-out" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up.[7][23] In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said "I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars."[24][20][25] A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.[26]
The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation,[4] became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains.[27] Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having "tears of joy" or "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done."[4]
Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits.[7][28][29] In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie.[30] Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation.[31] Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls.[10]
Style[edit]
Keane's paintings are recognizable by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects.[24] Keane says she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature "Keane eyes" when she started painting portraits of children. "Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger", Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more.[8][32] Keane attributes Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she has painted women since 1959. Other artists who influenced her in use of color, dimension and composition include Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Picasso.[10] Despite her claims to fine art, she has never been a critical success; instead she remained "known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of high-ironic style decades later."[33]
Personal life[edit]
Keane's first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich; they had a daughter together. She married Walter Keane in 1955. In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him in 1965, and relocated from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.[34] She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter.[23][35] Keane lived in Hawaii for over 25 years, before returning to California in 1991. She resides in Napa County, California.[32]
Media portrayal[edit]

In 1973, Woody Allen's comedy Sleeper features people of the future, who consider Keane to be one of the greatest artists in history.
In 1998, cartoon series The Powerpuff Girls by animator Craig McCracken debuts, featuring leads based on Keane's "waifs" and a character named "Ms. Keane".[36]
In 1999, Matthew Sweet's album In Reverse features one of Keane's oil paintings on its cover.[37]
In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz.[38] The film was directed by Tim Burton.[30] Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.[39]

Margaret D. H. Keane (born Peggy Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927)[1] is an American artist. Creator of the "big-eyed waifs", Keane is famous for drawing paintings with big eyes, and mainly paints women, children and animals in oil or mixed media. While the work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates and cups, it has been critically dismissed as kitsch. One reviewer pointed to its ubiquity in discount stores: "They hung in Woolworth's, next to the velvet Elvi, or maybe it was Walgreen's, by the clowns."[2] The work was originally attributed to Keane's husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after an in-court "paint-off" in Hawaii.[2] A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic Big Eyes. She maintains a gallery in San Francisco which boasts "the largest collection of Margaret Keane's art in the entire world."[3] In light of the great gulf between her work's popularity and its critical lampooning, she has been called the "Wayne Newton of the art world."[4]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Keane was born in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them.[5]
Keane started drawing as a child and at the age of 10 took a few classes at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville.[6][7] Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane still has the painting today.[8] She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings.
At the age of 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year.[9][10] She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits.[9] Margaret early began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and oil-based paints, but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).[11]
Career with Walter Keane[edit]
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a "well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes.[12] At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side.[13] He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his "highly successful real estate career" in 1947.[14] Margaret found him "suave, gregarious and charming."[13] The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.[15]
Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic "big eyes" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work.[13] The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco.[16] When she discovered his deception, she remained silent. She later explained her behavior: "I was afraid of him because he [threatened] to have me done in if I said anything."[13] But Margaret even publicly acknowledged him as the artist, while later claiming it was "tortuous" for her. She rationalized the situation on the ground that "[a]t least they were being shown."[17]
In 1957 Walter began exhibiting the "big eyes" paintings as his own. In February the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito.[18] He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claims to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another an a small East Side gallery for the same month.[19]
Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of "The Painting Keanes."[17]
In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."[20] On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times's art critic expressed outrage, calling it "[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair." He described Keane as a painter celebrated "for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane."[21] Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair.
During this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband, Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her paintings.[22] At the height of the artworks' popularity, she was painting non-stop for 16 hours a day.[8]
Career after Walter Keane[edit]
In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a "paint-out" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up.[7][23] In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said "I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars."[24][20][25] A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.[26]
The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation,[4] became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains.[27] Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having "tears of joy" or "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done."[4]
Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits.[7][28][29] In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie.[30] Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation.[31] Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls.[10]
Style[edit]
Keane's paintings are recognizable by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects.[24] Keane says she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature "Keane eyes" when she started painting portraits of children. "Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger", Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more.[8][32] Keane attributes Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she has painted women since 1959. Other artists who influenced her in use of color, dimension and composition include Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Picasso.[10] Despite her claims to fine art, she has never been a critical success; instead she remained "known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of high-ironic style decades later."[33]
Personal life[edit]
Keane's first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich; they had a daughter together. She married Walter Keane in 1955. In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him in 1965, and relocated from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.[34] She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter.[23][35] Keane lived in Hawaii for over 25 years, before returning to California in 1991. She resides in Napa County, California.[32]
Media portrayal[edit]

In 1973, Woody Allen's comedy Sleeper features people of the future, who consider Keane to be one of the greatest artists in history.
In 1998, cartoon series The Powerpuff Girls by animator Craig McCracken debuts, featuring leads based on Keane's "waifs" and a character named "Ms. Keane".[36]
In 1999, Matthew Sweet's album In Reverse features one of Keane's oil paintings on its cover.[37]
In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz.[38] The film was directed by Tim Burton.[30] Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.[39]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Keane was born in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them.[5]
Keane started drawing as a child and at the age of 10 took a few classes at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville.[6][7] Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane still has the painting today.[8] She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings.
At the age of 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year.[9][10] She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits.[9] Margaret early began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and oil-based paints, but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).[11]
Career with Walter Keane[edit]
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a "well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes.[12] At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side.[13] He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his "highly successful real estate career" in 1947.[14] Margaret found him "suave, gregarious and charming."[13] The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.[15]
Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic "big eyes" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work.[13] The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco.[16] When she discovered his deception, she remained silent.

She rationalized the situation on the ground that "[a]t least they were being shown."[17]
In 1957 Walter began exhibiting the "big eyes" paintings as his own. In February the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito.[18] He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claims to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another an a small East Side gallery for the same month.[19]
Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of "The Painting Keanes."[17]
In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."[20] On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times's art critic expressed outrage, calling it "[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair." He described Keane as a painter celebrated "for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane."[21] Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair.
During this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband, Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her paintings.[22] At the height of the artworks' popularity, she was painting non-stop for 16 hours a day.[8]
Career after Walter Keane[edit]
In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a "paint-out" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up.[7][23] In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said "I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars."[24][20][25] A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.[26]
The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation,[4] became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains.[27] Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having "tears of joy" or "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done."[4]
Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits.[7][28][29] In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie.[30] Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation.[31] Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls.[10]

In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him in 1965, and relocated from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.[34] She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter.[23][35] Keane lived in Hawaii for over 25 years, before returning to California in 1991. She resides in Napa County, California.[32]

In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz.[38] The film was directed by Tim Burton.[30] Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.[39]

Early life and education[edit]
Keane was raised in New York City, where her father was a police officer. His expectation for his six children[3] was to follow in his footsteps into law enforcement. All of Margaret's five siblings did just that, either themselves or marrying someone in law enforcement, but she decided instead to attend St. John’s University in Queens, New York, where she earned a BA in government and politics in 1981 and her MBA in 1987.[2][3]
Career[edit]
In 1980, when in college, she took a part-time job as a telephone debt collector at CitiCorp for $5.50 per hour.[2] During the following 16 years Keane climbed the ranks at CitiCorp until she was running their US retail operations. She then joined GE Capital. In 2011 she became the CEO of the firm's credit-card business, after filling several different capacities in operations and quality control, and finally in the credit card division.[2]
In 1996 Keane moved to GE and worked as Quality Leader for GE Capital’s Vendor Financial Services (VFS) division. Keane served as Chief Quality Leader of GECC from January 2000 until December 2001. In 2002 she joined GE Consumer Finance-Americas where she was Senior Vice President for Operations. Keane joined GE Capital Retail Consumer Finance in May, 2004. There she led the retail credit business. She was CEO and President of GE’s Retail Card platform for their North American retail finance business from June 2004 until April 2011. In 2005 Keane was named as a GE Officer. On November 29, 2005 she was named the chief executive officer and president of Retail Consumer Finance of Americas Operations at GE. Since April 2011 Keane served as the CEO and president of GE’s North American retail finance business.[1]
In July 2014 GE Capital led Synchrony, a new independent company, which was now the largest private-label credit card provider in the US.[4] With the launch of Synchrony Keane became one of only two women CEOs running US-owned, independent, publicly traded banks valued at over $10 billion.[2]
Recognition and honors[edit]
In the October 2011 issue of American Banker magazine, Keane was recognized as the 15th of 25 Most Powerful Women in Finance.[5] In 2012 her alma mater, St. John’s University, honored her with the Alumni Outstanding Achievement Award.[3]
Volunteer work[edit]
Keane is associated with “A Better Chance,” an organization that helps young minority students improve their chances of getting a better education and a real shot at going to college.[3]

LOS ANGELES — In 1964, Margaret Keane was among the most famous living artists in the country, only no one knew it. Ms. Keane was the painter behind the big-eyed waifs that were gracing rec rooms and lounges all across America, the mother of a legion of adorable, forsaken children. Her canvases were all signed simply “Keane,” and that allowed her husband, Walter Keane, a charlatan and salesman par excellence, to take credit for the work.The rise of the Keane aesthetic in the ’60s, and the gradual and extravagant unraveling of their lie, nearly two decades later, is the subject of Tim Burton’s new biopic, “Big Eyes,” opening Christmas Day. The film stars Amy Adams as Margaret, a shy woman in thrall to her domineering husband, and Christoph Waltz as Walter, a master manipulator who convinced everyone from Wayne Newton to Madame Chiang Kai-shek that he was a portraitist. After a high-flying, liquor-soaked California life, the real Walter Keane died nearly penniless in 2000, bitter that his ex-wife had mustered the gumption to sue him and reclaim her career. At 87, with more than 60 years as a painter, Ms. Keane is finally seeing her story come to the forefront.“I’m able to sign my name to the paintings,” she said, sitting in a suite at the Four Seasons here recently. “That is really a blessing.”

But reliving the turbulent marriage that ultimately brought her worldwide fame, and the choice she made to go along with her husband’s deception, wasn’t easy, Ms. Keane added. Continue reading the main story

“Looking back, how could I have been so stupid?” she said.“You weren’t stupid,” said Ms. Adams, who joined Ms. Keane for an interview. “It was just something that happened, you became complicit in it, and there was that living within that dynamic.”

Big Eyes, Big Lies


The artist Margaret Keane surprised the cast of “Big Eyes” — and herself — by showing up at the premiere of the new movie based on her stranger-than-fiction life.

                    By Samantha Stark on                                                                Publish Date December 18, 2014.

Ms. Keane’s trajectory was in some ways a product of an era when women were encouraged to follow their husband’s lead, no matter the path. Although she had been painting since she was a girl, Ms. Keane believed a female artist wouldn’t sell as well as a man. She never doubted her talent — she paints to this day at her home in Napa and sells work at Keane Eyes Gallery in San Francisco — but her newfound confidence paralleled the rise of the women’s movement and an acceptance of outsider and pop artists. Deeply private and now a Jehovah’s Witness, she has an unlikely story placed her in the middle of a profound cultural shift.To prepare for the role, Ms. Adams sat with Ms. Keane at her easel. “I can paint a leaf,” Ms. Adams said, laughing. “I can mix a very nice green.” Listening to Ms. Keane describe her own heartfelt artistic style in the interview, she grew teary.“This happens when I talk to Margaret,” Ms. Adams said, drying her eyes. “That’s how I knew it was the right fit, because when I’m drawn to a character, it’s because of the person.”When Margaret Ulbrich met Walter Keane in the 1950s in San Francisco, he portrayed himself as a real estate salesman turned painter of Parisian street scenes. Divorced and with a young daughter, she saw him as a provider and a romantic. “In the beginning, he was just the most charming person you could ever meet,” Ms. Keane said. But a few years into their marriage, she discovered a crate of street scenes and realized her husband’s work was actually painted by someone else. “He had me completely fooled,” she said. “I thought he was an artist.”Confronted with his lie, Walter convinced her that his muse was just in repose. “He’s saying, ‘Well, I’m rusty, and I’ll learn, if you’ll teach me a little bit,’ ” she recalled. “And I wanted to believe him, and I tried to teach him. And then it was my fault he couldn’t learn, because I wasn’t teaching him right.”Meanwhile, Ms. Keane’s big-eyed canvases were beginning to draw attention and, thanks to Walter’s promotional skills, buyers. As the images gained favor — with the public if not the art world — Walter thought to make inexpensive prints and license the urchins for postcards, mugs, plates and more. “He made them famous overnight,” Ms. Keane said. “I don’t know if they would have ever gotten off the ground otherwise.”

For her, feverishly painting ever more doleful creatures while her husband gallivanted, this period was a nightmare, she said. “I was in this trap, and I was getting in deeper and deeper. I didn’t have enough sense to stop it, or courage. And then, I think, lying like that, I think he began to lose touch with reality. I think he actually convinced himself he could paint, maybe.” They divorced in 1965, but he continued to play the part of the wildly successful artist.

In 1970, Ms. Keane, remarried and happily living in Hawaii, began to speak out publicly about her authorship. And in 1986, Walter’s skill with a brush was tested in dramatic fashion in a Honolulu courtroom, when she brought a defamation suit against him, and her lawyers argued that the only way to settle the case was a paint-off. Ms. Keane provided a signature waif in under an hour; Mr. Keane claimed a shoulder injury and never daubed a stroke. She won the case and damages of $4 million (later vacated). Yet to his dying day, Mr. Keane swore that he was the creator of the Big Eye look, and that his wife had learned it by copying him.The writer and editor Adam Parfrey spent time with Mr. Keane for an article in The San Diego Reader in 1992 that was expanded into the new book “Citizen Keane: The Big Lies Behind The Big Eyes,” written with Cletus Nelson. In interviewing some of Mr. Keane’s longtime friends, “I couldn’t find a single person who had actually seen him paint,” Mr. Parfrey said.

Mr. Waltz, a two-time Oscar winner, plays Mr. Keane as a diabolical smoothie, but the real-life Walter was even more over the top than he appears in the film, those who knew him said, especially during the trial, in which he represented — and cross-examined — himself.“That the judge had declared him unfit and had to put something over his mouth so he wouldn’t talk,” Mr. Parfrey said. “That might be too much even for a Tim Burton film.” (Mr. Parfrey had no involvement with the movie, although a previous book he edited was an inspiration for “Ed Wood,” a film by the same screenwriters, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, that Mr. Burton directed.)Mr. Alexander and Mr. Karaszewski approached Ms. Keane about making a film around 11 years ago, she said. But the project languished until Mr. Burton came on board, eager to return to intimate character stories after effects-laden films like “Alice in Wonderland.” The Keane film is his first indie, he said, and had the shortest production schedule and probably the lowest budget since “Pee-wee’s Big Adventure,” his 1985 feature debut.

Mr. Burton had long collected Keanes, which he had first seen while growing up in suburbia. “I found them interesting because I found them quite disturbing,” he said. “It was like, ‘Why do you have a picture of a crying child on a wall?’ ”The divided response to the work, pilloried as kitsch by critics but resurrected as a pop culture fad every few years, also attracted him. “The polarization of it — some people loved it, some people hated it — I’ve experienced that myself,” he said.He commissioned portraits from Ms. Keane and was struck by her demeanor. “In some ways,” he said, “she’s the quietest feminist: ‘I am woman, you can barely hear me speak.’ ” But “underneath, there was a spark,” he added. “This person who could easily be thought of a victim, but she wasn’t a victim.”

Across from Ms. Adams, Ms. Keane’s silver bangles clanking as she talked might have been the loudest things about her. Though interest in her work, and prices on the secondary market, have spiked with publicity about the movie, the attention has been draining for her. “I’d rather be home alone, painting,” she said.Ms. Adams volunteered that she’d rather be home, too. With equally sharp blue eyes, they sweetly talked about the other qualities they share.“We’re polite women who are ornery inside,” Ms. Adams said. “We’ll get you when you least expect it.”That was evident at a question-and-answer session after a recent screening here, when Ms. Keane praised Mr. Burton’s work on the film. “Actually,” she added mischievously, “I really directed it, and he’s taking all the credit.”

Margaret D. H. Keane (born Peggy Doris Hawkins, September 15, 1927)[1] is an American artist. Creator of the "big-eyed waifs", Keane is famous for drawing paintings with big eyes, and mainly paints women, children and animals in oil or mixed media. While the work achieved commercial success through inexpensive reproductions on prints, plates and cups, it has been critically dismissed as kitsch. One reviewer pointed to its ubiquity in discount stores: "They hung in Woolworth's, next to the velvet Elvi, or maybe it was Walgreen's, by the clowns."[2] The work was originally attributed to Keane's husband, Walter Keane. After their divorce in the 1960s, Margaret soon claimed credit, which was established after an in-court "paint-off" in Hawaii.[2] A resurgence of interest in Margaret Keane's work followed the release of Tim Burton's 2014 biopic Big Eyes. She maintains a gallery in San Francisco which boasts "the largest collection of Margaret Keane's art in the entire world."[3] In light of the great gulf between her work's popularity and its critical lampooning, she has been called the "Wayne Newton of the art world."[4]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Keane was born in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them.[5]
Keane started drawing as a child and at the age of 10 took a few classes at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville.[6][7] Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane still has the painting today.[8] She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings.
At the age of 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year.[9][10] She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits.[9] Margaret early began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and oil-based paints, but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).[11]
Career with Walter Keane[edit]
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a "well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes.[12] At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side.[13] He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his "highly successful real estate career" in 1947.[14] Margaret found him "suave, gregarious and charming."[13] The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.[15]
Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic "big eyes" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work.[13] The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco.[16] When she discovered his deception, she remained silent. She later explained her behavior: "I was afraid of him because he [threatened] to have me done in if I said anything."[13] But Margaret even publicly acknowledged him as the artist, while later claiming it was "tortuous" for her. She rationalized the situation on the ground that "[a]t least they were being shown."[17]
In 1957 Walter began exhibiting the "big eyes" paintings as his own. In February the work was shown on a wall of the Bank of America in Sausalito.[18] He took nine paintings to New Orleans, which he claims to have sold during Mardi Gras. That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another an a small East Side gallery for the same month.[19]
Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of "The Painting Keanes."[17]
In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."[20] On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times's art critic expressed outrage, calling it "[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair." He described Keane as a painter celebrated "for grinding out formula pictures of wide-eyed children of such appalling sentimentality that his product has become synonymous among critics definition of tasteless hack work. [The painting] contains about 100 children and hence is about 100 times as bad as the average Keane."[21] Robert Moses, stung by the resulting criticism, prevented the painting from being displayed at the Fair.
During this time her artwork was sold under the name of her husband, Walter Keane, who claimed credit for her paintings.[22] At the height of the artworks' popularity, she was painting non-stop for 16 hours a day.[8]
Career after Walter Keane[edit]
In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a "paint-out" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up.[7][23] In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said "I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars."[24][20][25] A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.[26]
The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation,[4] became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains.[27] Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having "tears of joy" or "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done."[4]
Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits.[7][28][29] In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie.[30] Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation.[31] Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls.[10]
Style[edit]
Keane's paintings are recognizable by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects.[24] Keane says she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature "Keane eyes" when she started painting portraits of children. "Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger", Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more.[8][32] Keane attributes Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she has painted women since 1959. Other artists who influenced her in use of color, dimension and composition include Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Picasso.[10] Despite her claims to fine art, she has never been a critical success; instead she remained "known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of high-ironic style decades later."[33]
Personal life[edit]
Keane's first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich; they had a daughter together. She married Walter Keane in 1955. In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him in 1965, and relocated from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.[34] She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter.[23][35] Keane lived in Hawaii for over 25 years, before returning to California in 1991. She resides in Napa County, California.[32]
Media portrayal[edit]

In 1973, Woody Allen's comedy Sleeper features people of the future, who consider Keane to be one of the greatest artists in history.
In 1998, cartoon series The Powerpuff Girls by animator Craig McCracken debuts, featuring leads based on Keane's "waifs" and a character named "Ms. Keane".[36]
In 1999, Matthew Sweet's album In Reverse features one of Keane's oil paintings on its cover.[37]
In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz.[38] The film was directed by Tim Burton.[30] Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.[39]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Keane was born in Nashville, Tennessee. When she was two, her eardrum was permanently damaged during a mastoid operation. Unable to hear properly she learned to watch the eyes of the person talking to her to understand them.[5]
Keane started drawing as a child and at the age of 10 took a few classes at the Watkins Art Institute in Nashville.[6][7] Keane painted her first oil painting of two little girls, one crying and one laughing, when she was 10 years old and gave the drawing to her grandmother. Keane still has the painting today.[8] She was well known at the local church for her sketches of angels with big eyes and floppy wings.
At the age of 18 she attended the Traphagen School Of Design in New York City for a year.[9][10] She began work painting clothing and baby cribs in the 1950s until she finally began a career painting portraits.[9] Margaret early began experimenting in Kitsch. She worked in both acrylic- and oil-based paints, but her work was limited to women, children and familiar animals (cats, dogs, horses).[11]
Career with Walter Keane[edit]
Some time in the mid-1950s, Margaret, married with a child, met Walter Keane. As Walter Keane told the story when he was at the height of his popularity, he saw her sitting alone at a "well known North Beach bistro and he was attracted by her large eyes.[12] At the time Walter was also married, worked as a real estate salesman and painted on the side.[13] He would later tell reporters, however, that he had given up his "highly successful real estate career" in 1947.[14] Margaret found him "suave, gregarious and charming."[13] The two married in 1955 in Honolulu.[15]
Margaret has said that he began selling her characteristic "big eyes" paintings immediately, but unknown to her, claimed it was his own work.[13] The principal venue for his sales was the hungry i, a comedy club in San Francisco.[16] When she discovered his deception, she remained silent.

That summer Walter arranged for a showing at the Washington Square Outdoor Art show in New York City. Displaying his talent for promotion, during that trip he arranged for a showing in August at the Sheraton Hotel in Chicago and another an a small East Side gallery for the same month.[19]
Walter began developing a mythology about himself and to a lesser extent Margaret. He eventually began promotions of "The Painting Keanes."[17]
In the 1960s, Keane became one of the most popular and commercially successful artists of the time. Andy Warhol said "I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it."[20] On the other hand, when one of the exhibitors at the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing, Queens, announced that it would exhibit Keane's Tomorrow Forever, a painting of a countless number of doe-eyed waifs from the horizon to the foreground where they lined up on a staircase, the New York Times's art critic expressed outrage, calling it "[t]he most grotesque announcement yet from the New York World's Fair."

In 1970, Keane announced on a radio broadcast she was the real creator of the paintings that had been attributed to her ex-husband Walter Keane. After Keane revealed the truth, a "paint-out" between Margaret and Walter was staged in San Francisco's Union Square, arranged by Bill Flang, a reporter from the San Francisco Examiner and attended by the media and Margaret. Walter did not show up.[7][23] In 1986, she sued both Walter and USA Today in federal court for an article claiming Walter was the real artist. At the trial, the judge famously ordered both Margaret and Walter to each create a big-eyed painting in the courtroom, to determine who was telling the truth. Walter declined, citing a sore shoulder, whereas Margaret completed her painting in 53 minutes. After a three-week trial, the jury awarded her $4 million in damages. After the verdict Keane said "I really feel that justice has triumphed. It's been worth it, even if I don't see any of that four million dollars."[24][20][25] A federal appeals court upheld the verdict of defamation in 1990, but overturned the $4 million damage award. Keane says she doesn't care about the money and just wanted to establish the fact that she had done the paintings.[26]
The artworks Keane created while living in the shadow of her husband tended to depict sad-looking children in dark settings. After she left Walter, moved to Hawaii and, after years of following astrology, palmistry, handwriting analysis and transcendental meditation,[4] became a Jehovah's Witness, her work took on a happier, brighter style. "The eyes I draw on my children are an expression of my own deepest feelings. Eyes are windows of the soul", Keane explains.[27] Many galleries now advertise her artworks as having "tears of joy" or "tears of happiness". She described her subjects thus: "These are the paintings of children in paradise. They are what I think the world is going to look like when God's will is done."[4]
Hollywood actors Joan Crawford, Natalie Wood and Jerry Lewis commissioned Keane to paint their portraits.[7][28][29] In the 1990s, Tim Burton, a Keane art collector and director of the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes about the life of Margaret Keane, commissioned the artist to paint a portrait of his then-girlfriend Lisa Marie.[30] Keane's art was bought and presented to the United Nations Children's Fund in 1961 by the Prescolite Manufacturing Corporation.[31] Keane's big eyes paintings have influenced toy designs, Little Miss No Name and Susie Sad Eyes dolls, and the cartoon The Powerpuff Girls.[10]
Style[edit]
Keane's paintings are recognizable by the oversized, doe-like eyes of her subjects.[24] Keane says she was always interested in the eyes and used to draw them in her school books. She began painting her signature "Keane eyes" when she started painting portraits of children. "Children do have big eyes. When I'm doing a portrait, the eyes are the most expressive part of the face. And they just got bigger and bigger and bigger", Keane said. Keane focused on the eyes, as they show the inner person more.[8][32] Keane attributes Amedeo Modigliani's work as a major influence on the way she has painted women since 1959. Other artists who influenced her in use of color, dimension and composition include Van Gogh, Gustav Klimt and Picasso.[10] Despite her claims to fine art, she has never been a critical success; instead she remained "known for her sticky-sweet paintings of doe-eyed waifs that became the middlebrow rage in the late 1950s and 1960s, then kitschy collectibles of high-ironic style decades later."[33]
Personal life[edit]
Keane's first husband was Frank Richard Ulbrich; they had a daughter together. She married Walter Keane in 1955. In 1964, she left Walter and divorced him in 1965, and relocated from San Francisco to Hawaii. In Hawaii Keane met Honolulu sports writer Dan McGuire and married him in 1970.[34] She credits McGuire for helping her to become less timid and afraid after her divorce from Walter.[23][35] Keane lived in Hawaii for over 25 years, before returning to California in 1991. She resides in Napa County, California.[32]
Media portrayal[edit]

In 1973, Woody Allen's comedy Sleeper features people of the future, who consider Keane to be one of the greatest artists in history.
In 1998, cartoon series The Powerpuff Girls by animator Craig McCracken debuts, featuring leads based on Keane's "waifs" and a character named "Ms. Keane".[36]
In 1999, Matthew Sweet's album In Reverse features one of Keane's oil paintings on its cover.[37]
In the 2014 biographical film Big Eyes, Margaret Keane and her ex-husband Walter are the main focus of the film. Margaret was portrayed by Amy Adams and Walter was played by Christoph Waltz.[38] The film was directed by Tim Burton.[30] Margaret Keane makes an appearance in the film, as an elderly lady sitting on a park bench, in the scene where Adams' and Waltz's characters are outside the Palace of Fine Arts. Margaret Keane turned down various offers for the film rights. After meetings with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, she agreed to the film rights and approved the screenplays written by Alexander and Karaszewski. The film took 11 years from development to completion.[39]
