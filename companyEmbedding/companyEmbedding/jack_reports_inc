About Us




Founded in 1951, Jack in the Box Inc. is a restaurant company that operates and franchises Jack in the Box® restaurants and—through a wholly owned subsidiary—Qdoba Mexican Eats® restaurants.
Jack in the Box is among the nation’s leading fast-food hamburger chains, with more than 2,200 quick-serve restaurants in 21 states and Guam. As the first major hamburger chain to develop and expand the concept of drive-thru dining, Jack in the Box has always emphasized on-the-go convenience, with approximately 85 percent of the half-billion guests served annually buying food at the drive-thru or for take-out. In addition to drive-thru windows, most restaurants have indoor dining areas and are open 18-24 hours a day.
Jack in the Box pioneered a number of firsts in the quick-serve industry, including menu items that are now staples on most fast-food menu boards, like the breakfast sandwich and portable salads. Today, Jack in the Box offers a selection of distinctive, innovative products targeted at the fast-food consumer, including hamburgers, specialty sandwiches, salads and real ice cream shakes. Hamburgers represent the core of the menu, including the signature Jumbo Jack®, Sourdough Jack®, Ultimate Cheeseburger and Buttery Jack™ burgers. And, because value is important to fast-food customers, the company’s menu also features Jack’s Deals, which includes value-priced products like tacos, chicken nuggets, a chicken sandwich and a Jr.. Bacon Cheeseburger.
In addition to offering high-quality products, Jack in the Box recognizes that an increasing number of quick-serve customers also want the ability to customize their meals. Whether that means forgoing the bun and sauce in favor of a low-carb burger, or substituting ingredients to create the exact mix of flavors to suit an individual’s personal tastes, customers have that flexibility at Jack in the Box. “We don’t make it ‘til you order it®.” So, regardless of the order, each meal is served hot and fresh to customers. We also serve our full menu, including breakfast, all day every day. So whether you want a Buttery Jack™ burger for breakfast or Breakfast Jack® sandwich for dinner, you can get what you want whenever you want it at Jack in the Box.

Qdoba Mexican Eats, which was acquired by Jack in the Box Inc. in January 2003, is a leader in fast-casual dining - with more than 700 restaurants in 47 states as well as the District of Columbia and Canada. Qdoba is a Mexican kitchen where anyone can go to enjoy a fresh, handcrafted meal prepared right in front of them. Each Qdoba restaurant showcases food that celebrates a passion for ingredients, a menu full of innovative flavors, handcrafted preparation and inviting service.

Style Scores:



C Value | C Growth | F Momentum | D VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Reports Second Quarter FY 2017 Earnings; Updates Guidance for FY 2017; Declares Quarterly Cash DividendBusiness WireMay 16, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareSAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jack in the Box Inc. (JACK) today reported earnings from continuing operations of $33.8 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for the second quarter ended April 16, 2017, compared with $29.0 million, or $0.85 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.Operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure which the company defines as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from refranchising, were $0.98 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared with $0.85 in the prior year quarter.A reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements to GAAP results is provided below, with additional information included in the attachment to this release. Figures may not add due to rounding.                12 Weeks Ended           28 Weeks Ended              April 16,2017             April 10,2016         April 16,2017             April 10,2016       Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations – GAAP          $   1.09         $   0.85       $   2.22         $   1.78       Restructuring charges           0.04           —         0.08           —       Gains from refranchising             (0.15   )           —           (0.15   )           (0.01   )     Operating earnings per share – Non-GAAP         $   0.98           $   0.85       $   2.15           $   1.77      During fiscal 2016, the company announced plans to reduce general and administrative costs. A comprehensive review of its organizational structure identified cost savings from workforce reductions, relocation and consolidation of the Qdoba corporate support center, refranchising initiatives, and information technology synergies across both brands. As a result, restructuring charges of $2.2 million, or approximately $0.04 per diluted share, were recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Charges consist primarily of facility closing and employee relocation costs. These charges are included in “Impairment and other charges, net” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of earnings.Lenny Comma, chairman and chief executive officer, said, “While operating earnings per share increased 15 percent versus last year, driven primarily by lower G&A, our second quarter performance was below our expectations. After a sluggish start to the quarter, which we believe was attributable to delayed tax refunds and record rainfall in California, Jack in the Box® system same-store sales improved to positive territory as these transitory issues passed and we pivoted our advertising towards value messages. However, same-store sales at Qdoba® company restaurants worsened in the latter two months of the quarter, as we lapped more aggressive discounting in last year's second quarter. While margins at Qdoba were still disappointing, they improved to over 16 percent in the final month of the quarter as we were able to manage labor and food costs more effectively than in the first quarter, despite the larger decline in same-store sales. We are also encouraged that Qdoba company same-store sales have improved thus far in the third quarter.“At our investor meeting last May, we said one of the factors that would cause us to reconsider our strategy with respect to Qdoba was valuation. It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the company is being impacted by having two different business models. As a result, we've retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to assist the Board in its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well as other ways to enhance shareholder value.“Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our Jack in the Box refranchising initiative, with the sale of 60 restaurants in the second quarter. In addition, as of today, we have signed non-binding letters of intent with franchisees to sell approximately 70 additional restaurants.”   Increase/(decrease) in same-store sales*:                          12 Weeks Ended           28 Weeks Ended              April 16,2017 *             April 10,2016         April 16,2017 *             April 10,2016      Jack in the Box:                               Company         (2.4)%       (1.0)%       (0.7)%       (0.2)%     Franchise         (0.4)%       0.3%       2.0%       1.1%     System         (0.8)%       0.0%       1.4%       0.8%     Qdoba:                               Company         (5.9)%       3.1%       (3.4)%       2.2%     Franchise         (0.3)%       1.2%       (0.3)%       1.8%     System         (3.2)%       2.1%       (1.9)%       2.0%      *Note: Due to the transition from a 53-week to a 52-week fiscal year, year-over-year fiscal period comparisons are offset by one week. The change in same-store sales presented in the 2017 column uses comparable calendar periods to balance the one-week shift and to provide a clearer year-over-year comparison.   Jack in the Box system same-store sales decreased 0.8 percent for the quarter and lagged the QSR sandwich segment by 1.5 percentage points for the comparable period, according to The NPD Group’s SalesTrack® Weekly for the 12-week time period ended April 16, 2017. Included in this segment are 16 of the top QSR sandwich and burger chains in the country. Company same-store sales decreased 2.4 percent in the second quarter driven by a 7.1 percent decrease in transactions, partially offset by average check growth of 4.7 percent.Qdoba same-store sales decreased 3.2 percent system-wide and 5.9 percent for company restaurants in the second quarter. Company same-store sales reflected an 8.2 percent decrease in transactions, partially offset by growth in average check and catering sales.Consolidated restaurant operating margin, a non-GAAP measure1, decreased by 240 basis points to 17.5 percent of sales in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 19.9 percent of sales in the year-ago quarter. Restaurant operating margin for Jack in the Box company restaurants, a non-GAAP measure1, decreased 100 basis points to 19.7 percent of sales. The decrease was due primarily to higher labor costs related to wage inflation, higher repairs and maintenance costs, and sales deleverage, which were partially offset by a decrease in food and packaging costs. The decrease in food and packaging costs as a percentage of sales resulted from the benefit of menu price increases, favorable product mix and commodity deflation of approximately 0.3 percent in the quarter. Restaurant operating margin for Qdoba company restaurants, a non-GAAP measure1, decreased 480 basis points to 13.5 percent of sales. The decrease was due primarily to sales deleverage, the impact of new restaurant openings over the last 12 months, an increase in food and packaging costs and the impact of wage inflation. The increase in food and packaging costs as a percentage of sales was impacted by unfavorable product mix, which was partially offset by a decrease in discounting. Commodity costs at Qdoba were flat in the quarter compared to the prior year.Read MoreFranchise margin, a non-GAAP measure1, as a percentage of total franchise revenues improved to 54.4 percent in the second quarter from 53.8 percent in the prior year quarter. The improvement was due primarily to higher franchise fees related to the sale of 60 company-operated Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees in the second quarter, lower depreciation and a decrease in franchise support and other costs. These increases were partially offset by decreases in rental revenues and royalties resulting from the acquisition of 19 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants at the beginning of the quarter which the company intends to refranchise, and an increase in occupancy expenses due primarily to a decrease in favorable lease commitment adjustments related to previously refranchised markets.  ____________________________     (1) Restaurant operating margin and franchise margin are non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to consolidated earnings from operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the attachment to this release. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measurements to GAAP Results."  SG&A expense for the second quarter decreased by $11.1 million and was 9.7 percent of revenues as compared to 13.0 percent in the prior year quarter. Key items contributing to the decrease were the impact of the company's restructuring activities, a $3.3 million decrease in incentive compensation, a $2.6 million decrease in advertising, a $2.1 million decrease in pension and postretirement benefits, as well as a $2.0 million decrease in insurance costs. These decreases were partially offset by mark-to-market adjustments on investments supporting the company's non-qualified retirement plans, which resulted in a $1.5 million year-over-year increase in SG&A.Interest expense, net, increased by $4.0 million in the second quarter due to increased leverage and a higher effective interest rate for 2017.The tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 38.2 percent versus 36.7 percent for the second quarter of 2016. The higher tax rate was due primarily to a decrease in work opportunity tax credits in the second quarter of 2017, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments supporting the company's non-qualified retirement plans in the second quarter of 2016.Capital AllocationThe company repurchased approximately 2,229,000 shares of its common stock in the second quarter of 2017 at an average price of $98.27 per share for an aggregate cost of $219.0 million.On May 11, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0 million stock buyback program. This leaves approximately $181.0 million remaining under stock buyback programs authorized by the company's Board of Directors that expire in November 2018.The company also announced today that on May 11, 2017, its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share on the company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on June 12, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2017.GuidanceThe following guidance and underlying assumptions reflect the company’s current expectations for the third quarter ending July 9, 2017, and fiscal year ending October 1, 2017.

AND SUBSIDIARIESRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS(Unaudited)Operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the company as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a GAAP basis excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from refranchising. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides important supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing the performance of the company’s core business. In addition, the company uses operating earnings per share in establishing performance goals for purposes of executive compensation. The company encourages investors to rely upon its GAAP numbers but includes this non-GAAP financial measure as a supplemental metric to assist investors. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure used by the company may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.Below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

These non-GAAP measures do not include an allocation of other operating expenses, such as selling, general and administrative expenses which include the costs of shared service functions such as accounting, finance and human resources, and other unallocated costs such as pension expense, share-based compensation and restructuring expense. As such, restaurant operating margin and franchise margin are not indicative of the overall results of the company and are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information to assist investors in understanding and analyzing the performance of the company's core business and operating results. The company encourages investors to rely upon its GAAP numbers, but includes these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to, not as a substitute for, earnings from operations, net earnings or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Jack in the Box Inc. Reports Second Quarter FY 2017 Earnings; Updates 
      Guidance for FY 2017; Declares Quarterly Cash Dividend






May 16, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jack in the Box Inc. (NASDAQ: JACK) today reported earnings from 
      continuing operations of $33.8 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, for 
      the second quarter ended April 16, 2017, compared with $29.0 million, or 
      $0.85 per diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
    


      Operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure which the company 
      defines as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a 
      GAAP basis excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from 
      refranchising, were $0.98 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared 
      with $0.85 in the prior year quarter.
    

      A reconciliation of non-GAAP measurements to GAAP results is provided 
      below, with additional information included in the attachment to this 
      release. Figures may not add due to rounding.

      During fiscal 2016, the company announced plans to reduce general and 
      administrative costs. A comprehensive review of its organizational 
      structure identified cost savings from workforce reductions, relocation 
      and consolidation of the Qdoba corporate support center, refranchising 
      initiatives, and information technology synergies across both brands. As 
      a result, restructuring charges of $2.2 million, or approximately $0.04 
      per diluted share, were recorded during the second quarter of fiscal 
      2017. Charges consist primarily of facility closing and employee 
      relocation costs. These charges are included in “Impairment and other 
      charges, net” in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of 
      earnings.
    

      Lenny Comma, chairman and chief executive officer, said, “While 
      operating earnings per share increased 15 percent versus last year, 
      driven primarily by lower G&A, our second quarter performance was below 
      our expectations. After a sluggish start to the quarter, which we 
      believe was attributable to delayed tax refunds and record rainfall in 
      California, Jack in the Box® system same-store sales improved 
      to positive territory as these transitory issues passed and we pivoted 
      our advertising towards value messages. However, same-store sales at 
      Qdoba® company restaurants worsened in the latter two months 
      of the quarter, as we lapped more aggressive discounting in last year's 
      second quarter. While margins at Qdoba were still disappointing, they 
      improved to over 16 percent in the final month of the quarter as we were 
      able to manage labor and food costs more effectively than in the first 
      quarter, despite the larger decline in same-store sales. We are also 
      encouraged that Qdoba company same-store sales have improved thus far in 
      the third quarter.
    

      “At our investor meeting last May, we said one of the factors that would 
      cause us to reconsider our strategy with respect to Qdoba was valuation. 
      It has become more apparent since then that the overall valuation of the 
      company is being impacted by having two different business models. As a 
      result, we've retained Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to assist the Board in 
      its evaluation of potential alternatives with respect to Qdoba, as well 
      as other ways to enhance shareholder value.
    

      “Lastly, we continue to make good progress on our Jack in the Box 
      refranchising initiative, with the sale of 60 restaurants in the second 
      quarter. In addition, as of today, we have signed non-binding letters of 
      intent with franchisees to sell approximately 70 additional restaurants.”

            *Note: Due to the transition from a 53-week to a 52-week fiscal 
            year, year-over-year fiscal period comparisons are offset by one 
            week. The change in same-store sales presented in the 2017 column 
            uses comparable calendar periods to balance the one-week shift and 
            to provide a clearer year-over-year comparison.
          




      Jack in the Box system same-store sales decreased 0.8 percent for the 
      quarter and lagged the QSR sandwich segment by 1.5 percentage points for 
      the comparable period, according to The NPD Group’s SalesTrack® 
      Weekly for the 12-week time period ended April 16, 2017. Included in 
      this segment are 16 of the top QSR sandwich and burger chains in the 
      country. Company same-store sales decreased 2.4 percent in the second 
      quarter driven by a 7.1 percent decrease in transactions, partially 
      offset by average check growth of 4.7 percent.
    

      Qdoba same-store sales decreased 3.2 percent system-wide and 5.9 percent 
      for company restaurants in the second quarter. Company same-store sales 
      reflected an 8.2 percent decrease in transactions, partially offset by 
      growth in average check and catering sales.
    

      Consolidated restaurant operating margin, a non-GAAP measure1,
decreased by 240 basis points to 17.5 percent of sales in the 
      second quarter of 2017, compared with 19.9 percent of sales in the 
      year-ago quarter. Restaurant operating margin for Jack in the Box 
      company restaurants, a non-GAAP measure1, decreased 100 basis 
      points to 19.7 percent of sales. The decrease was due primarily to 
      higher labor costs related to wage inflation, higher repairs and 
      maintenance costs, and sales deleverage, which were partially offset by 
      a decrease in food and packaging costs. The decrease in food and 
      packaging costs as a percentage of sales resulted from the benefit of 
      menu price increases, favorable product mix and commodity deflation of 
      approximately 0.3 percent in the quarter. Restaurant operating margin 
      for Qdoba company restaurants, a non-GAAP measure1, decreased 
      480 basis points to 13.5 percent of sales. The decrease was due 
      primarily to sales deleverage, the impact of new restaurant openings 
      over the last 12 months, an increase in food and packaging costs and the 
      impact of wage inflation. The increase in food and packaging costs as a 
      percentage of sales was impacted by unfavorable product mix, which was 
      partially offset by a decrease in discounting. Commodity costs at Qdoba 
      were flat in the quarter compared to the prior year.
    

      Franchise margin, a non-GAAP measure1, as a 
      percentage of total franchise revenues improved to 54.4 percent in the 
      second quarter from 53.8 percent in the prior year quarter. The 
      improvement was due primarily to higher franchise fees related to the 
      sale of 60 company-operated Jack in the Box restaurants to franchisees 
      in the second quarter, lower depreciation and a decrease in franchise 
      support and other costs. These increases were partially offset by 
      decreases in rental revenues and royalties resulting from the 
      acquisition of 19 franchise-operated Jack in the Box restaurants at the 
      beginning of the quarter which the company intends to refranchise, and 
      an increase in occupancy expenses due primarily to a decrease in 
      favorable lease commitment adjustments related to previously 
      refranchised markets.
    



          ____________________________
        



          (1) Restaurant operating margin and franchise margin are non-GAAP 
          measures. These non-GAAP measures are reconciled to consolidated 
          earnings from operations, the most comparable GAAP measure, in the 
          attachment to this release. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP 
          Measurements to GAAP Results."
        



      SG&A expense for the second quarter decreased by $11.1 million and was 
      9.7 percent of revenues as compared to 13.0 percent in the prior year 
      quarter. Key items contributing to the decrease were the impact of the 
      company's restructuring activities, a $3.3 million decrease in incentive 
      compensation, a $2.6 million decrease in advertising, a $2.1 million 
      decrease in pension and postretirement benefits, as well as a $2.0 
      million decrease in insurance costs. These decreases were partially 
      offset by mark-to-market adjustments on investments supporting the 
      company's non-qualified retirement plans, which resulted in a $1.5 
      million year-over-year increase in SG&A.
    

      Interest expense, net, increased by $4.0 million in the second quarter 
      due to increased leverage and a higher effective interest rate for 2017.
    

      The tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 38.2 percent versus 36.7 
      percent for the second quarter of 2016. The higher tax rate was due 
      primarily to a decrease in work opportunity tax credits in the second 
      quarter of 2017, and favorable mark-to-market adjustments on investments 
      supporting the company's non-qualified retirement plans in the second 
      quarter of 2016.
    

Capital Allocation


      The company repurchased approximately 2,229,000 shares of its common 
      stock in the second quarter of 2017 at an average price of $98.27 per 
      share for an aggregate cost of $219.0 million.
    

      On May 11, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0 
      million stock buyback program. This leaves approximately $181.0 million 
      remaining under stock buyback programs authorized by the company's Board 
      of Directors that expire in November 2018.
    

      The company also announced today that on May 11, 2017, its Board of 
      Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share on the 
      company’s common stock. The dividend is payable on June 12, 2017, to 
      shareholders of record at the close of business on May 30, 2017.

JACK IN THE BOX INC. AND SUBSIDIARIESRECONCILIATION OF 
      NON-GAAP MEASUREMENTS TO GAAP RESULTS(Unaudited)


      Operating earnings per share, a non-GAAP measure, is defined by the 
      company as diluted earnings per share from continuing operations on a 
      GAAP basis excluding restructuring charges and gains or losses from 
      refranchising. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure 
      provides important supplemental information to assist investors in 
      analyzing the performance of the company’s core business. In addition, 
      the company uses operating earnings per share in establishing 
      performance goals for purposes of executive compensation. The company 
      encourages investors to rely upon its GAAP numbers but includes this 
      non-GAAP financial measure as a supplemental metric to assist investors. 
      This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as a substitute 
      for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with 
      GAAP. In addition, this non-GAAP financial measure used by the company 
      may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable 
      to, similarly titled measures used by other companies.
    

      Below is a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating earnings per share to 
      the most directly comparable GAAP measure, diluted earnings per share 
      from continuing operations. Figures may not add due to rounding.

      Restaurant operating margin and franchise margin are non-GAAP measures 
      presented in the reconciliations below. These non-GAAP measures do not 
      include an allocation of other operating expenses, such as selling, 
      general and administrative expenses which include the costs of shared 
      service functions such as accounting, finance and human resources, and 
      other unallocated costs such as pension expense, share-based 
      compensation and restructuring expense. As such, restaurant operating 
      margin and franchise margin are not indicative of the overall results of 
      the company and are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management 
      believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide important 
      supplemental information to assist investors in understanding and 
      analyzing the performance of the company's core business and operating 
      results. The company encourages investors to rely upon its GAAP numbers, 
      but includes these non-GAAP financial measures as a supplement to, not 
      as a substitute for, earnings from operations, net earnings or other 
      financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these 
      non-GAAP financial measures used by the company may be calculated 
      differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly 
      titled measures used by other companies.
    

      Below are the reconciliations of non-GAAP restaurant operating margin 
      and franchise margin to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, 
      consolidated earnings from operations.
