coverage needs.

There are several different considerations you may have. It is important that the policy and coverage you select 
matches your individual needs and situation. Today most companies offer two policy types: Health Savings 
Accounts (HSA) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPO).

An HSA is a tax advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers who are enrolled in a high 
deductible health plan. Participants self-fund deductible amounts on a pre-tax basis. The provider covers 
additional expenses at 100%.

A PPO is a managed care insurance plan that provides access to a network or group of physicians contracted 
by an insurance company. Participants have annual deductible, co-pay expenses for office visits and 
prescriptions. Most plans have an out of pocket maximum.

The Rito Group represents a large number of the health insurance companies in the marketplace today. 
Carrier access varies by state. Each state has its own standard for meeting the new federal guidelines that are 
in place. Our  agents can work with you to help determine the best solution for your health insurance needs.

Ohio Insurance
We are The Rito Group., specializing in Ohio insurance including home, auto, liability, motorcycle, life & 
health, business & commercial and workers compensation insurance in Ohio.

Ohio Liability, Property and Workers Compensation Insurance
Many of the public and product liability risks are often covered together under a general liability policy. 
These risks may include bodily injury or property damage caused by direct or indirect actions of the 
insured. In the United States, general liability insurance coverage most often appears in the 
Commercial General Liability policies obtained by businesses. You will need to buy a commercial auto 
insurance policy depending on the kind of driving you do. Call us, and we will provide a customized plan 
based on details about how you use vehicles in your business, who will be driving them and whether 
employees, if you have them, are likely to be driving their own cars for your business.

Ohio Home & Auto Insurance
Homeowners insurance protects you from financial losses caused by storms, fire, theft, and other 
events outlined in your policy. Carrying the right amount of coverage is essential to protecting your 
family and belongings. We also offer comprehensive insurance coverage for single or multiple 
instruments, musical instrument dealers, recording studios, bands, and entire orchestras through Total 
Instrument Insurance.

You can get quotes from many well known reliable auto insurance companies and choose the best 
policy with the right coverages for your needs at the cheapest price. Many of our customers have 
saved tons of money on their auto insurance. We provide excellent after-sales services as well. After 
you purchase your policy, you can use our website to make changes to your policy and report claims. 
Visit our auto insurance page to see why you need home insurance and questions to ask your agent 
before purchasing.

Business Auto Insurance

Business auto or commercial auto insurance policies help protect your businesses and your employees. Many 
different businesses have a need for business auto insurance. Examples are: contractors, tow truck 
companies, couriers, services, dry cleaners, retail delivery, carpet cleaning, appliance and electronic repair 
companies, pizza delivery, trucks and dump trucks.

Business auto insurance provides protection for liability, uninsured and underinsured motorists, medical 
payments, comprehensive and collision. Coverage can be extended on some policies for employees using 
their personal cars for business.

There are several occupations such as a home based business, real estate or insurance and financial 
services that may not require a commercial auto policy. Often these types of businesses can instead have a 
âbusiness useâ rating on their personal auto insurance policy. In order to understand whether you should have 
a business auto policy it is best to consult an agent.

The Rito Group represents a number of companies that offer business auto insurance. It is important that the 
policy and coverage you select matches your business needs. By working with an experienced our agent you 
can avoid gaps in coverage and determine which company and policy is right for your business.

Home/Renters Insurance

Homeownerâs insurance policies provide coverage for your home in six main areas: Dwelling, Separate 
Structures, Contents, Loss of Use, Personal Liability and Medical Payments.

add coverage for additional items such as collectibles, jewelry or even a home based business.

Renters insurance is coverage for your contents and personal liability when you rent a house, apartment or 
condo from a company or individual.

It is important that the policy and coverage you select matches your individual needs. By working with an 
experienced agent you can avoid gaps in coverage and determine which company and policy is right for you.

renters and manufactured home insurance companies in the marketplace today. Our knowledgeable  agents

Commercial Bonds

Commercial Bonds are generally thought of in terms of Surety Bonds. Surety insurance is a contract between 
at least three parties: the Surety provides the hiring party (obligee), a guarantee that the contractor or person 
hired (principal) will perform or they will be returned their funds.

There are two main groups of bonds: contract bonds and commercial bonds. Contract bonds guarantee the 
performance of a contract such as: performance, bid, supply or maintenance. Commercial bonds guarantee 
terms such as: permit, license, court, public official and fidelity bonds.

There are many different types of business that may require a Surety Bond such as financial institutions, 
healthcare, retail and service related businesses, contractors and technology companies to name a few. 
Surety Bond premiums vary and will depend on the type of bond, amount of the bond and the credit or financial 
strength of the person or business requiring it.

The Rito Group offers several types of Surety Bonds. It is important that the coverage you select matches your 
business needs. By working with an experienced our agents you can avoid gaps in coverage and determine 
which company and program is right for your business.

Business Owners Policy

A Business Owners Policy (BOP) is a business insurance policy that provides a package of basic coverage for 
most small to medium sized businesses. A BOP offers coverage that is normally less expensive than if it were 
purchased separately. BOP policy coverage includes property coverage for your building, liability coverage, 
contents coverage for inventory, equipment and fixtures and business interruption to replace lost income for up 
to a year in the event of a covered loss.

Many other coverage options are available such as crime, glass breakage, outdoor signage, valuable papers 
and records and electronic data recreation may be available depending on the particular company.

Some examples of businesses that purchase BOP policies include: retail stores, service related businesses, 
professional offices, dry cleaners, wholesale suppliers, motel and hotel, deliâs and coffee shops.

The Rito group represents a number of companies that offer Business Owner Policies. It is important that the 
policy and coverage you select matches your business needs. By working with an experienced our agent you 
can avoid gaps in coverage and determine which company and policy is right for your business.

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.


On December 19, 2016, Rito Group Corp. (the Company) completed
the issuance and sale of an aggregate of 60,000 shares at a price

NOTES TO
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Currency
expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))

(Unaudited)

 

 

 NOTE 1 -
BASIS OF PREPARATION

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) for
interim financial reporting and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission that permit reduced disclosure
for interim periods. Therefore, certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted.

 

In the
opinion of management, the consolidated balance sheet as of June
30, 2016 which has been derived from audited financial statements
and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary
to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year
ending June 30, 2017 or for any future period.

 

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management’s
Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto
included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2016.

 

NOTE 2 -
ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND

 

Rito Group
Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated on March 24,
2015 under the laws of the state of Nevada.

 

The
Company, through its subsidiaries, mainly engages in trading of
retail goods such as cookware, jewelry and watches, and numerous
other products.

NOTE 3 -
GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the
going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the
realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of
$1,200,300 and continuously incurred a net operating loss of
$265,488 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The
continuation of the Company as a going concern through June 30,
2017 is dependent upon improving the profitability and the
continuing financial support from its stockholders. Management
believes the existing shareholders or external financing will
provide the additional cash to meet the Company’s obligations
as they become due.

 

These and
other factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements
do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the
amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the
Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

 

NOTE 4 -
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies
as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and notes.

 




●



Basis of
presentation




 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”).

 




●



Basis of
consolidation




 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Rito Group Corp. and its subsidiaries. All significant
inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have
been eliminated upon consolidation.

 




●



Use of
estimates




 

In
preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements,
management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and
revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results
may differ from these estimates.

●



Cash and
cash equivalents




 

Cash and
cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand,
demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of
three months or less as of the purchase date of such
investments.

 




●



Accounts
receivable




 

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for
doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical collection
trends and aging of receivables. Management also periodically
evaluates individual customer’s financial condition, credit
history, and the current economic conditions to make adjustments in
the allowance when it is considered necessary. Account balances are
charged off against the allowance after all means of collection
have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote.

 




●



Subscriptions
receivable




 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $30,000
share subscriptions receivable from a shareholder. There was no
subscriptions receivable as of September 30, 2016.

 




●



Revenue
recognition




 

In
accordance with the Accounting Standard Codification
(“ASC”) Topic 605 “Revenue
Recognition” , the Company recognizes revenue when the
following four criteria are met: (1) delivery has occurred or
services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; (3) selling price is fixed or determinable; and (4)
collectability is reasonably assured.

 

 

Revenue is
measured at the fair value of the consideration received or
receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue.
Revenue from trading of retail goods is recognized when title and
risk of loss are transferred and there are no continuing
obligations to the customer. Title and the risks and rewards of
ownership transfer to and accepted by the customer when the
products are collected by the customer at the Company’s
office. Revenue is recorded net of sales discounts, returns,
allowances, and other adjustments that are based upon
management’s best estimates and historical experience and are
provided for in the same period as the related revenues are
recorded. Based on limited operating history, management estimates
that there was no sales return for the period reported.

 

The
Company derives its revenue from sales of goods to individuals.
Generally, the Company recognizes revenue when products are sold
and accepted by the customers and there are no continuing
obligations to the customer.

 




●



Cost of
revenues




 

Cost of
revenue includes the purchase cost of retail goods for re-sale to
the customers.

 




●



Income
taxes




 

The
provision of income taxes is determined in accordance with the
provisions of ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes”
(“ASC Topic 740”). Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax
consequences attributable to differences between the financial
statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and
their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to
taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

 

ASC Topic
740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should
recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial
statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on
a tax return. Under ASC Topic 740, tax positions must initially be
recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than
not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax
authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be
measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater
than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with
the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and
relevant facts.

 

The
Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and
there was no effect on the financial conditions or results of
operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The
Company conducts major businesses in Hong Kong and is subject to
tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities,
the Company will file tax returns that are subject to examination
by the foreign tax authority.

 




●



Net loss
per share




 

The
Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic
260 “Earnings per share” . Basic loss per share
is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per
share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the
denominator is increased to include the number of additional common
shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common
stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common
shares were dilutive.

 




●



Foreign
currencies translation




 

Transactions
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are
translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates
prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional
currency are translated into the functional currency using the
applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting
exchange differences are recorded in the statements of
operations.

NOTES TO
CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR THE
THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016

(Currency
expressed in United States Dollars (“US$”))

(Unaudited)

 

 

 

The
reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiary in Anguilla is
United States Dollars (“US$”). The Company’s
subsidiary in Hong Kong maintains its books and record in Hong Kong
Dollars (“HK$”), which is functional currency as being
the primary currency of the economic environment in which the
entity operates.

 

In
general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not US$ are translated
into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30,
“Translation of Financial Statement” , using the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are
translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains
and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of
foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of
accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of
stockholders’ equity.

 

Translation
of amounts from the local currencies of the Company into US$ has
been made at the following exchange rates for the respective
periods:

 




 



 



As of and
for the
three months ended
September 30,

Related
parties




 

Parties,
which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be
related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to
control the other party or exercise significant influence over the
other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies
are also considered to be related if they are subject to common
control or common significant influence.

 




●



Fair value
of financial instruments




 

The
carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments: cash
and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepayments, deposits
and other receivables, accounts payable, other payables and accrued
liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the
short-term nature of these financial instruments.

 

The
Company follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10,
“Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures”
(“ASC Topic 820-10”), with respect to financial assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820-10
establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:

 




 



Level
1 :
Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets;





 



 





 



Level
2 : Inputs,
other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable
either directly or indirectly; and





 



 





 



Level
3 :
Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data,
which require the reporting entity to develop its own
assumptions




 

Fair value
estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant
market information about the financial instrument. These estimates
are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of
significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with
precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the
estimates.

 




●



Recent
accounting pronouncements




 

The
Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption
of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material
impact on its financial condition or the results of its
operations.

 

NOTE 5 -
SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY

 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued an
aggregate of 42,600 shares of its common stock at $1.5 per share
for aggregate gross proceeds of $63,900 for initial public
offering.

 

As of
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company has a total of
50,755,480 and 50,712,880 shares, respectively of its common stock
issued and outstanding. There are no shares of preferred stock
issued and outstanding.

 

NOTE 6 -
CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE

 

As of
September 30, 2016, the Company issued convertible promissory notes
(collectively the “Convertible Notes”) to investors in
an aggregated principal and accrued interest of $888,410 and
$66,477, respectively. The Convertible Notes bear interest at a
rate of 8% per annum with a maturity of two years, due in 2017&
2018. The principal and accrued interest are payable in a lump sum
at the maturity. The notes are convertible into shares of the
Company’s common stock at a conversion price of $0.25 per
share at the note holders’ sole and exclusive
option.

 

For the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the accrued
interest expense of $18,802 and $0, respectively are recognized in
the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company
