“Now when I think about my career, it seems limitless. Five years into this, I’ve already joined the board of directors of one of our investments. If you asked me four years ago if I thought I’d be on the board and actually be making a difference, I would have said ‘no.’ So I don’t know exactly where it is that my career would ultimately end up, but I don’t see a road block and I don’t see an end to the opportunity right now.”
Scott Eisenberg - Managing Director, GSO      
“Blackstone is the largest alternative investment manager in the world, but what that really means is that we’re investing on behalf of pension plans and pensioners. Just about anywhere you go in the world, you can see real estate Blackstone owns on behalf of our limited partners.”
Kathleen McCarthy - Senior Managing Director, Real Estate      
“A lot of my engineering background was about problem solving, how do you come at a solution and how do you think about it in a new way, and a lot of that is really translatable into finance and working with clients.”
Viral Patel - Managing Director, Tactical Opportunities

Private Equity
Putting Capital to Work, Making Companies Stronger.





Overview Our investments span a wide range of industries around the world in established and growth-oriented businesses alike. Playing a vital role in helping companies realize their growth potential, we uncover value by identifying great companies and enhancing their performance by providing patient capital and operating support to strong management teams. Our approach helps our portfolio companies grow core businesses, launch new initiatives, make transformative acquisitions and upgrade technologies and systems to support their long-term strategy.   
We provide more than just capital. We seek to make the companies we invest in stronger through a bottoms-up strategy of transformation. Crucially, we bring the expertise of our Portfolio Operations Group to provide strategic guidance on a variety of operational improvements, including revenue growth, procurement, leadership development, lean process and IT optimization, energy sustainability, and employee health care.
  







				A Message from Joe Baratta, Global Head of Private Equity
			










DRIVING
Transformative Impact  We strive to create value by investing in great businesses where our capital, strategic insight, global relationships and operational support can drive transformation that unlocks the company’s potential. In addition to benefiting our investors, the improvements in growth and global competitiveness benefit workers, communities and other stakeholders. 
We are patient investors who practice the art of the long view, and are committed to achieving the best long-term outcomes for our businesses and our investors. 
 


DISCIPLINED
Due Diligence  Our investment approach is based on a disciplined due diligence process that measures risk while identifying the catalysts for increased value. We purposefully engage only in friendly transactions and work with talented management teams to achieve transformative results. Our specialized Portfolio Operations Group helps to maximize value by improving processes across varied elements of a business’s operations.    
The returns that these investments earn for our investors – pension funds, academic and charitable institutions, governments and other institutions, as well as retail investors – help to secure and grow the assets needed to support retirees and fund essential programs.

Available Capital to Invest




“ “We are constantly looking for situations where we see something, or we are able to add value in a way that our competitors don't. Our people feel the obligation to go out there and find special situations where we can intervene to drive change.”  - Joseph Baratta Global Head of Private Equity   











   
Pro-active, targeted sourcing  Sector-based, theme-driven deal sourcing is the primary responsibility and mandate of our investment professionals. We aim to source high-quality and proprietary investment opportunities by proactively developing and leveraging strong relationships with companies and key deal intermediaries. At regular pipeline meetings with sector teams, we review potential opportunities and determine what resources – both internal and external – are best suited to pursue those opportunities.  




   
Value-oriented discipline In determining value for new investments, we focus on a business’s current outlook and judge the predictability of that outlook over time, while also factoring in what we can do for the business to drive even better outcomes after our acquisition. 
  




   
Transformational operating improvements 
We actively target companies in which significant value can be created through clear strategic and operational change, and created our Portfolio Operations Group to provide hands-on support to help our portfolio companies become more productive, efficient and valuable. Once a company joins the portfolio, we help management craft a plan to reach their full potential over the long term, and provide assistance as they put this plan into practice.  




Our Portfolio


We are proud of Blackstone’s role as a positive economic catalyst for the companies in our Corporate Private Equity portfolio. We work to identify, invest in and enhance the value of great businesses.


Global in scope, our Corporate Private Equity group has offices in Toronto, New York, London, Dusseldorf, Mumbai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Sydney. As of June 30, 2017, our Corporate Private Equity funds held interests in 82 companies.

Traditional Leveraged Buyouts 

We pursue control leveraged buyouts of both large and mid-cap companies globally

                Our large buyouts tend to be in companies of global scale with strong brands and high relative market shares, where we can still drive growth and operating improvements.  Our mid-cap buyouts tend to be of companies that are differentiated vs. larger competitors and have protected market niches and multiple avenues of growth and operating improvements.

Dubbed "core" private equity, this vehicle would invest in slower-growing but safer companies, use less debt in buyouts and charge investors lower fees than most private equity funds, these people said. Blackstone is seeking as much as $2 billion apiece from five to six of its biggest public pension fund and sovereign wealth fund investors for the strategy, the people said.      Aspects of the strategy, including the exact fees and holding periods for investments, are still being worked out, these people said. They added that the idea is still at an exploratory stage and may not take off.     A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment. The biggest investors in Blackstone's funds include the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the New Jersey State Investment Council and China Investment Corp.      The move underscores how Blackstone is looking to boost its valuation as a publicly listed company by managing more permanent capital and further diversifying its model of buying and selling companies. Blackstone is already the world's largest alternative asset manager, with $284.4 billion in assets under management as of the end of September spanning private equity, real estate, credit and funds of hedge funds.  A higher stock valuation would benefit Blackstone shareholders, of whom the company's employees form the largest group. Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman is the biggest holder by far, owning about a fifth of the firm. In 2013, Schwarzman collected $352.5 million from dividends from his Blackstone shares.      The new strategy also would help Blackstone address what has been a frustration for some buyout firms and a source of envy when they compare their investment vehicles with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. In this vehicle, Blackstone would not be forced to sell successful companies too soon because the fund is running out of time. Most private equity investors however, also known as limited partners, prefer the traditional buyouts because they deliver high annualized returns. The prospect of lower returns may not be an easy sell.      "The fact that investors will pay lower fees is positive. But the question is whether the net returns will still be high enough to justify investing in such a product as opposed to publicly listed stocks," said Steven Kaplan, a University of Chicago finance professor whose research focuses on private equity.         In June, at Blackstone's annual shareholder meeting, President Tony James acknowledged that the core private equity model would have challenges. Limited partners in its funds would likely say no to the prospect of a 10 percent to 12 percent return for a high-quality company when they can get 18 percent to 20 percent for private equity, James said. But he added that there could be ways around that.      The "core" model approach has already been applied to some alternative asset classes. Core real estate, for example, involves investing in safer, long-lease assets with less debt rather than riskier fixer-upper properties.     Blackstone, based in New York, began investing in what it calls core-plus real estate this year through separately managed investor accounts before combining them into a co-mingled fund.  Blackstone is embarking on its core private equity initiative also through separately managed accounts, the people said.     A few firms such as General Atlantic LLC and Golden Gate Capital have also raised so-called evergreen or perpetual funds to invest in private equity, but they target the higher returns that Blackstone's traditional private equity business does.     First Pitch Blackstone, which does not want to abandon its established private equity business, has had to look at a differentiated "core" strategy to avoid conflicts with its traditional private equity funds, the sources said.      The firm first made its pitch on the new strategy to investors last summer at its annual limited partner summit in a confidential presentation, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.     Limited partners were told a 20-year core private equity fund could deliver 1.8 times the profit on capital invested in succession over the same period in three conventional private equity funds. The example assumes a 12 percent internal rate of return for a core private equity fund and 20 percent IRR for a traditional fund.      This is because only up to two-thirds of the capital committed to a traditional private equity fund is invested at any one time, limited partners were told. As against that, Blackstone would invest the entire capital raised in a core private equity in one-go. The costs of buying and selling companies also add up over time, according to the presentation.     The popularity of the strategy may come down to the fees investors are charged.      While these have not been decided, Blackstone in its limited partner presentation offered an example of a core fund that took 15 percent of profits in the form of carried interest, a divergence from the almost universal 20 percent industry standard in private equity.
