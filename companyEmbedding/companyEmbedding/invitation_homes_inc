We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $1,449.8 million, or approximately
$1,670.5 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares from us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with the
borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, to repay our existing credit facilities
and our mortgage loan relating to the IH1 2013-1 securitization and a portion of
the mortgage loan relating to the IH1 2014-1 securitization transaction, and to
pay fees and expenses related to this offering.

The following table sets forth the maturity and the interest rate, as of
September 30, 2016, of the indebtedness to be repaid: 

           Indebtedness to be Repaid      Maturity Date     Interest Rate
           IH1 2015 Credit Facility      October 3, 2017        3.28%    
           IH2 2015 Credit Facility       March 29, 2017        3.28%    
           IH3 2013 Credit Facility       June 30, 2017         3.53%    
           IH4 2014 Credit Facility        May 5, 2017          3.54%    
           IH5 2014 Credit Facility        June 5, 2017         3.03%    
           IH6 2016 Credit Facility       April 13, 2018        3.13%    
           IH1 2013-1 Mortgage Loan      December 9, 2017       2.21%    
           IH1 2014-1 Mortgage Loan        June 9, 2017         2.37% 

Certain of the underwriters and/or their respective affiliates are lenders under
or hold positions in the indebtedness to be repaid and accordingly will receive
a portion of the proceeds of this offering.


We face competition from different sources in each of our two primary
activities: acquiring properties and renting our properties. We believe our
competitors in acquiring properties are individual investors, small private
investment partnerships looking for one-off acquisitions of investment
properties that can either be rented or restored and sold, and larger investors,
including private equity funds and other REITs, that are seeking to capitalize
on the same market opportunity that we have identified. Our primary competitors
in acquiring portfolios include large and small private equity investors, public
and private REITs and other sizeable private institutional investors. These same
competitors may also compete with us for residents. Competition may increase the
prices for properties that we would like to purchase, reduce the amount of rent
we may charge for our properties, reduce the occupancy of our portfolio and
adversely impact our ability to achieve attractive total returns. However, we
believe that our acquisition platform, our extensive in-market property
operations infrastructure and local expertise in our markets provide us with
competitive advantages.


Company Description
We are a leading owner and operator of single-family homes for lease in the
United States. Our portfolio of nearly 50,000 high quality homes is wholly owned
and is concentrated in attractive in-fill submarkets of major MSAs. We have
selected locations with strong demand drivers, high barriers to


 entry and high
rent-growth potential. We are highly concentrated in the Western United States
and Florida, with 72% of our revenues generated in those regions and 54% of
revenues coming from California and Florida alone during the three months ended
September 30, 2016. Through disciplined market and asset selection, we designed
our portfolio to capture the operating benefits of local density as well as
economies of scale that we believe cannot be readily replicated. Since our
founding in 2012, we have built a proven, vertically integrated operating
platform that allows us to effectively and efficiently acquire, renovate, lease,
maintain and manage our homes. We believe that the investments we make, and the
high standard to which we renovate our homes, improve our local communities both
by offering residents choice and access to a superior quality of living and by
driving local employment. Our world-class portfolio and differentiated,
vertically integrated platform have enabled us to achieve strong operating
results and we believe create significant opportunities for future growth.

We invest in markets that we expect will exhibit lower new supply, stronger job
and household formation growth and superior NOI growth relative to the broader
U.S. housing and rental market. Within our 13 markets, we target attractive
neighborhoods in in-fill locations with multiple demand generators, such as
proximity to major employment centers, desirable schools and transportation
corridors. More than 95% of our revenue for the three months ended September 30,
2016 was earned in markets where we have at least 2,000 homes, driving
significant operational efficiency. Our homes average approximately 1,850 square
feet with three bedrooms and two bathrooms and an average monthly rent of $1,623
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, appealing to a resident base that
we believe is less transitory than the typical multifamily resident. We have
made approximately $1.2 billion of upfront renovation investment in the homes in
our portfolio, representing approximately $25,000 per home, in order to address
capital needs, reduce ongoing maintenance costs and drive resident demand. As a
result, our portfolio benefits from high occupancy and low turnover rates, and
we are well positioned to drive strong rent growth, attractive margins and
predictable cash flows.

Through our disciplined operating and investment expertise, we:

• generated $905 million in total revenues for the twelve months ended 
  September 30, 2016;                                                       

• increased net effective rental rates on leases signed in the quarter ended
  September 30, 2016 by 6.1% over the prior lease rates;                    

• achieved average occupancy of 96.1% for our 36,569 home Same Store portfolio
  (consisting of homes which had commenced their initial post-renovation lease
  prior to October 3, 2014) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016;

• grew total revenues for our Same Store portfolio by 5.0% for the nine months
  ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 
  2015;                                                       

• grew NOI for our Same Store portfolio by 7.4% for the nine months ended   
  September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015; 
  and                                                                 

• experienced home price appreciation of 6.2% in our markets for the twelve 
  months ended September 30, 2016 (weighted by revenue contribution) based on 
  the September 2016 Case Shiller Index, compared to growth in the broader U.S.
  market of 5.5%.                                             

We believe we are well positioned to achieve organic growth through a
combination of rent increases driven by strong market fundamentals (including
demographic shifts), new ancillary revenue opportunities and increasing
operational efficiencies. We continue to identify and implement new
opportunities to drive revenue in the near and longer term by applying proven
approaches of multifamily rental providers. We also see opportunities to expand
margins by centralizing additional support and administrative functions and
continuing to optimize our platform. In addition, we intend to capitalize on a
highly fragmented market by utilizing our proven acquisition capability and
flexible balance sheet to make attractive investments.
