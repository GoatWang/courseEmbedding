Rugged Mobile Computing Solutions for Industries
Each global industry - and each individual organization - requires a unique mobility strategy to support their operations structure and business goals. Yet enterprise mobility requirements are far from standard across all vertical markets.

We are vertical experts who know your business. We recognize the unique rugged computing requirements of your workflows and the demands of your mobile workers' daily flow.

Rugged Mobile Computing Solutions for Industries
Each global industry - and each individual organization - requires a unique mobility strategy to support their operations structure and business goals. Yet enterprise mobility requirements are far from standard across all vertical markets. Many field-service and industrial sectors demand more rugged computing solutions capable of handling the extreme environmental conditions and data-intense processes that comprise a typical day at the "office." Others mandate rugged mobile PCs with very specific feature sets not offered by traditional consumer-grade mobile devices or rugged laptops. For nearly 20 years, Xplore has been working closely with customers to define clear rugged mobile computing criteria for each industry it serves. We are vertical experts who know your business. We recognize the unique rugged computing requirements of your workflows and the demands of your mobile workers' daily flow. As a result, every Xplore rugged tablet and accessory is built in response to your industry's evolving rugged computing needs, and purpose-built to critical workflow specifications.See how Xplore's purpose-built rugged tablets meet the rugged computing requirements for your industry, enterprise mobility structure, and workflows.
