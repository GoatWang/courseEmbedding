Financial Planning














Your financial resources are comprised of many moving parts, including compensation, investments, retirement plans, trust benefits, and educational funds. We help you understand how these moving parts integrate with your goals with a planning process that is: 
Comprehensive: We look at everything with a dollar sign in front of it that touches your life. 
Customized: We do not provide “robo” advice or use a one-size-fits-all approach; we leverage dedicated software and technology and apply our judgment and experience to the outputs that matter to you.
Action-Oriented: Our process goes beyond the organization of your financial life; we figure out what needs to be done to achieve your financial goals and work with you on an implementation strategy.
Fluid: Financial planning is not a one-time exercise; it is an ongoing process that requires attention as your circumstances and/or goals change.







Planning with Ropes Wealth



Regardless of the source of your wealth, it is important to have a plan to manage, grow, preserve and ultimately distribute that wealth in a prudent fashion. Our process helps you to consider your goals and values, and to understand the tradeoffs in the decisions you make. We help you focus on near- and long-term objectives, so that your wealth is a tool for making an impact and not a cause for worry. Our process is logical, analytical, collaborative, and iterative, so that you feel comfortable and informed each step of the way.

Ropes Wealth Advisors: Our Investment Approach



























Client Login


















































Our Investment Approach














Our team is proud of our tradition of investment experience, integrity, and devotion to you. Our approach incorporates:
Customization: Ropes Wealth does not believe in off-the-shelf standardized solutions; we build investment plans only after we have listened to you and have understood your objectives and risk tolerance.
Transparency: Ropes Wealth does not sell investment products, and we do not profit from your choice of investment vehicles.
Institutional quality: Ropes Wealth's team of seasoned investment professionals are dedicated to your particular needs, and seek to bring you the best solutions, technology, and tools available in the marketplace.
Risk management: We strive to control risk through sophisticated asset allocation and access to high quality investment managers and vehicles.

Tax sensitivity: We recognize that it is not just the money you earn, it is the money you keep, so we make tax sensitivity an ongoing process, from portfolio structure to continuous monitoring to manager selection.







You are our Focus



Investing is not a competitive sport. The most important role we play as your investment advisor is to design an investment strategy which is crafted to reflect your objectives, preferences and temperament so as to give you the greatest likelihood of achieving your lifetime financial goals. We are not artificially driven by an attempt to beat the performance of an index that happens to be “hot” at the moment, nor do we attempt to time the movements of the financial markets.

Income Tax Advising
Ropes & Gray believes good income tax planning is integral to sound wealth management.







Income Tax Advising














Today’s tax laws are less certain and more complex than ever. Keeping abreast of the latest developments and tax-minimization strategies can be overwhelming.  Ropes & Gray will set out your options and choices so you can make informed decisions.  
Ropes & Gray’s Private Client Group lawyers and income tax professionals provide expertise in all areas of income tax advising, and will partner with you to develop solutions to your questions. Ropes & Gray’s broad experience extends over such areas as retirement planning and charitable giving, as well as techniques to make income tax efficient gifts and loans to family members. Ropes & Gray can help you achieve your objectives and minimize your income tax burden, thereby preserving your wealth.  







Make Plans for Your Plan



Have you considered the heavy income tax burden associated with your retirement plan? It may be wise to pay some tax now and convert your traditional IRA to a Roth IRA. Alternatively, if you are over 70½, you may be able to make contributions to charity directly from your retirement plan, in lieu of taking required minimum distributions. Ropes & Gray can help you consider the availability and advisability of these and other approaches to reducing your income taxes.
