Bethenny Frankel has launched her own production company, B Real Productions (BRP), and has inked an overall deal with Leftfield Entertainment, Variety has learned.
Under the new pact, Frankel will develop and produce projects with Leftfield by way of her new BRP shingle.
The news of Frankel’s deal comes the week of the premiere of “Food Porn,” a new FYI series produced by Frankel, hailing from Leftfield Entertainment group’s Loud TV. The unscripted foodie series explores the country’s food scene with a nationwide search for the most popular #foodporn dishes, inspired by the social-media phenomenon of posting photos of food with the hashtag.

Already in the works for Leftfield and BRP are “Closet Porn” and “Cocktail Porn,” potential installments in Frankel’s “porn”-oriented programming, bouncing off the inaugural “Food Porn.” Additionally, the two companies will develop more original projects that tap into Frankel’s passion and expertise in areas such as food, beverage, business, branding and lifestyle.
Before delving into TV production, Frankel founded the mega-successful Skinnygirl empire, which boasts low calorie alcoholic drinks, plus other products. Though relatively new to producing, Frankel is not new to television, as “The Real Housewives of New York City” star also hosted her own self-titled daytime syndicated talker.
“Bethenny’s super-human drive, innate sense of what can gain traction in the marketplace and in the media and her amazing entrepreneurial spirit make her a true complement and fit for Leftfield,” said the company’s CEO Brent Montgomery of the new deal. “She’s a total original and we’re eager to join forces to launch into Bethenny’s ‘porn’-oriented food, fashion and lifestyle worlds, and beyond.”
Frankel commented, “I’m excited to be launching B Real Productions and producing creative and innovative content with Brent, Adam and the rest of the Leftfield team. In addition to my time in front of the camera, I am enjoying being behind-the-scenes developing bold, disruptive and real programming.”
Frankel isn’t the first big personality to join forces with Leftfield. The production company is also in business with WWE star John Cena, who entered a development deal with Leftfield last year.
Frankel and Leftfield’s deal was brokered by Leftfield Entertainment’s chief creative officer Adam Sher, Frankel and CAA.
