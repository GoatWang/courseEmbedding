About









WHO WE ARE
Our roots are in one of America’s great entrepreneurial success stories. Fidelity Investments was founded in 1946 and grew from a single mutual fund into one of the largest asset management firms in the world, with over $2 trillion in assets under management. For the last forty years, our venture capital group has had the privilege of backing other great entrepreneurs as they built ground-breaking companies in technology and life sciences, including Atari, MCI, ROLM Corp., Alibaba, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, and Ultragenyx.
Today our funds are larger and more global, but our teams are still small and local. We stay true to our entrepreneurial roots. In the US and Europe, we are F-Prime Capital investing in healthcare (formerly Fidelity Biosciences) and in technology (formerly part of Devonshire Investors). In other geographies, our sister fund is called Eight Roads (formerly Fidelity Growth Partners), with investment teams in London, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Mumbai. Together we bring a world of insight, domain expertise and relationships to support our entrepreneurs. Without the pressure of fundraising from outside investors, we focus all of our time finding and helping great entrepreneurs build important companies.

OUR CORE BELIEFS
We are a group of entrepreneurs, operators, doctors, scientists, and investors. We have low egos, but big vision. We love the same science and technology that you do, and we are passionate when we meet teams with a unique insight on a market or who have found signal buried in data. We believe in the power of entrepreneurs to change the world, yet know that breakthrough medicine and genuine technology innovation take time to develop. We strive to partner with entrepreneurs who embrace that challenge and want an investor who shares their vision and desire to build great companies.

WHAT WE LOOK FOR
We feel it’s a privilege both to invest other people’s money and to partner with entrepreneurs. When we meet great teams, we are inspired by the opportunity to help them build their companies. Sometimes we make a big difference, sometimes a small difference; but we always look for teams for whom we have a critical insight and an ability to make a difference at key moments.
In healthcare, we focus on Biopharmaceuticals, MedTech, and Healthcare IT/Services in a stage-agnostic fashion.  We are constantly searching for the next big thing in healthcare, and sometimes, we will found that something ourselves.
In technology, we focus on Enterprise IT and FinTech, with a strong enterprise focus in both. We’re an early-stage investor by choice, but will back exceptional teams at any stage.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
