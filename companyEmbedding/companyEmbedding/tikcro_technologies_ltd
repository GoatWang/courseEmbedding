Tikcro Technologies Ltd. supports biotechnology projects originated in Israeli academic centers. Powered by a novel 3D antigen design technology, it generates “next generation” antibodies, currently in pre-clinical stage, blocking receptor / ligand surface domains of cancer immune modulators.
Following extensive research with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, Tikcro’s academic collaborator, we pursue the development of drug-candidates leveraging unique antigen design technology for the generation of new functional antibodies. This approach shows early success with the following pipeline. Going forward, in 2017 we plan to promote early-stage candidates into rigorous pre clinical trials and aim to build sufficient data for further progress and clinical trials.

Tikcro is pursuing the discovery and pre-clinical development of product candidates leveraging license agreements with Israeli academic research centers. A collaboration with the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel resulted with promising potential therapuetic antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Leveraging unique antigen design technology for the generation of antibodies, this approach shows early success in the following pipeline. Going forward, in 2017 we plan to promote early-stage candidates which we first validate into rigorous pre clinical trials and aim to build sufficient data for further progress and clinical trials.
We are currently focused on antibody drug-candidates for the stimulation of self immune system in combating cancer diseases. We expect our product candidate antibodies to block the ligand/receptor linkage of certain biological pathways, specifically antibodies that block CTLA-4, PD1 and TIGIT, and by blocking these pathways to prevent the inhibition of patients’ self immune system and its ability to attack cancerous cells. This prevention is known to have positive clinical effects and to extend overall survival.

Leveraging 3D antigen design approach, we designed antigens and immunized rodents in order to derive new antibodies that exclusively block the epitope binding surface of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4 also known as CD152) from its ligands CD80 and CD86. We focus on antibody drug-candidates that exclusively block this binding surface domain and do not block adjacent domains.
In 2011 a CTLA-4 antibody was first approved in the U.S. for clinical treatment of late stage melanoma. Revenues from this product exceeded $1.0 billion in 2016. Recently, clinical results of a combination treatment with a PD1 antibody, showed a strong synergy in the treatment of late stage melanoma, both as a first line therapy and as a second line of treatment. The U.S. FDA approved the combination treatment of both antibodies for late stage melanoma. With this synergetic clinical effect of the combination treatment, additional clinical indication for CTLA-4 antibody will be investigated.
T cells or T lymphocytes are a type of lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) that plays a central role in cell-mediated immunity. T lymphocytes recognize and destroy non self cells, including cancer cells. A natural inhibitory mechanism of binding CTLA-4, a receptor that resides on the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the lymph node, from its ligands CD80 and CD86, interrupts this destruction. A CTLA-4 antibody which binds to the surface domain of CTLA-4 receptor and its ligands, CD80 and CD86, reverse this inhibition effect over the immune system. By blocking this interaction, the “turning-off” of the cytotoxic reaction is reversed, and allows inhibitory signal transmitted through other pathways to cause the CTLs to destroy the cancer cells.
We plan to initially focus our pre clinical trials on models that address melanoma diseases, alone and in combination treatment with PD1 antibody.

Leveraging 3D antigen design approach, we designed antigens and immunized rodents in order to derive new antibodies that exclusively block the epitope binding surface of Programmed cell death protein 1, (PD1 also known as CD279), from its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. We focus on antibody candidates that exclusively block this binding surface domain and do not block adjacent domains.
In late 2014, two PD1 antibodies were approved in the U.S. for the first time for clinical treatment of late stage melanoma. In 2015 these antibodies were approved also to treat certain stages of lung cancer. Revenues from these two products exceeded $5.0 billion in 2016. Recently, clinical results of a combination treatment of PD1 antibody and CTLA-4 antibody showed a strong synergy in the treatment of late stage melanoma, both as a first line therapy and as a second line treatment. Accordingly, the combination treatment of PD1 antibody with CTLA-4 antibody was approved in the U.S. to treat late stage melanoma.
PD1 is a cell surface receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on T cells, B cells, and macrophages. By interacting with its ligands PDL1 and PDL2 it down regulates the immune system by preventing the activation of T-cells, which in turn reduces autoimmunity and promotes self-tolerance.
We plan to initially focus our pre clinical trials with models that address melanoma diseases and lung cancer, alone and in combination treatment with CTLA-4 antibody.

Unique Antibody Generation Approach for Cancer Immunotherapy;
Using 3D antigen immunization technology we aim to increase the therapeutic window and the blocking functionality of cancer immune antibodies. We allow for new therapeutic antibodies for immuno-oncology that address key limitations of existing antibody drugs and methodologies; We expect to bring functional blocking antibodies with exclusive binding qualities and the ability to address discontinued epitopes, qualities that are vital for cancer immune therapy.
Handful antibodies for cancer immunotherapy have recently shown meaningful improvements in clinical efficacy in treating cancer. The mechanism of action of such antibodies is based on blocking a receptor from interacting with certain ligands. However, these therapeutic antibodies show less than 50% response rate. In addition, certain portion of patients stop the treatment due to toxicities, as such antibody bind to additional domains that trigger auto immune malignancies. These toxicities limit patients’ ability to achieve the benefit of treatment.
We use unique 3D antigen design methodology to develop new antibody therapies that aim to have exclusive binding qualities over targeted domains and to block the receptor/ligand interaction without binding to other domains and to limit toxicity.

TEL AVIV, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

Reports financial results for the first quarter of 2017 









Tikcro Technologies Ltd. (OTCQB: TIKRF) today announced the selection of a lead blocking antibody for an immune modulator through a new approach of 3D antigen design and immunization. In addition, the Company reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. 
Aviv Boim, CEO of Tikcro, commented, "We are pleased to announce our successful screening of a lead blocking antibody for an immune modulator. This is the first lead antibody that we selected and verified for high affinity, blocking ligand interaction and specificity. Over the course of the next several months, we will focus our efforts on further exploring the new antibody's in-vitro characteristics, potential superiority and in-vivo assays.  
"Successfully generating and screening a new blocking antibody with high affinity and specificity is an exciting milestone for Tikcro. These results validate the new approach of 3D (three dimensional) antigen design and immunization. The ability to generate an antibody from animal-derived models with a high affinity towards a discontinued epitope is a satisfactory achievement of our development goals," concluded Mr. Boim. 
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $279,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $283,000, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the same period last year.  
As of March 31, 2017, the company reported $7.2 million in cash and cash equivalents.

Profile data is unavailable for this security.About the companyTikcro Technologies Ltd. (Tikcro) provides funding for early-stage biotechnology projects with a focus on oncology. The Company provides funding for early-stage biotechnology projects originating in Israeli academic centers. The Company's product candidate antibodies focuses on blocking the ligand/receptor linkage of certain biological pathways, specifically antibodies that block anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and by blocking these pathways to prevent the inhibition of patients' self immune system and its ability to attack cancerous cells. The Company focuses on antibody drug-candidates that block the binding surface domain and do not block adjacent domains. The Company's project focuses on the immune system pathways, which include CTLA-4 and its binding group of ligands; PD-1 and ligands PDL-1 and PDL-2, and T cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) and its binding group of ligands.Revenue in USD (TTM)0.00Net income in USD-1.28mIncorporated1999Employees2.00LocationTikcro Technologies LtdSapir Street 7 5th floorKiryat Weizmann Science ParkNESS-ZIONA 7403630IsraelISRPhone+972  89969800Fax+972  97442446Websitehttp://tikcro.com/More ▼Peer analysisKey InformationKey InformationStock PerformancePer Share DataEfficiencyManagement EffectivenessProfitabilityFinancial StrengthGrowth RatesCompanyRevenue (TTM)Net income (TTM)Market capEmployeesPrice/earnings (TTM)Price/book value (MRQ)Price/cash flow (TTM)Price/sales (TTM)EPS (excl. extraordinary items, TTM)EPS (incl. extraordinary items, TTM)Revenue per share (TTM)Book value per share (MRQ)Asset turnover (TTM)Inventory turnover (TTM)Receivables turnover (TTM)Revenues per employee (TTM)Return on avg assets (TTM)Return on avg assets (5 yr avg)Return on investment (TTM)Return on investment (5 yr avg)Gross margin (TTM)Gross margin(5 yr avg)Net profit margin (TTM)Net Profit margin(5 yr avg)Quick ratio (MRQ)Interest coverage (TTM)Total debt to capital (MRQ)Payout ratio(5 yr avg)Revenue(YOY change %)Revenue(5 yr growth rate)Net income(YOY change %)Net income(5 yr growth rate)Capital expenditure(5 yr growth rate)Dividend(5 yr growth rate)Myrexis Inc0.00-11.62m2.79m1.00--2.40-----0.4191-0.41910.000.03370.00----0.00-25.02-32.79-25.67-35.12-------3,256.41----0.00------62.76------Atossa Genetics Inc0.00-5.74m2.97m2.00--0.9911-----1.49-1.490.000.40360.00----0.00-155.20-116.59-216.72-150.42--55.58---4,078.74----0.00---100.00--50.08---41.72--RightSmile Inc208.91k-533.82k3.00m7.00--0.445--14.36-0.0003-0.00030.000090.00020.23512.265.52---60.05---91.94--67.34---255.53--0.2017-2.070.2056--------------OXIS International, Inc.0.00-7.23m3.03m2.00---------0.2068-0.20680.00-0.1460.00-------5,258.91-2,940.59------52.76---5,129.45---31.87-----100.00--164.27------China Medicine Corporation65.75m-114.38k3.06m281.00--0.03362.400.0466-0.2077-0.20772.315.280.70296.334.08233,999.906.12--6.57--33.46--8.70--10.455.650.0249--20.70---81.18------Peak Pharmaceuticals Inc0.00-1.88m3.13m1.00---------0.024-0.0230.00-0.00050.00-------698.96-928.60-1,581.59-1,686.7556.36---------969.43--------37.72------Boston Therapeutics Inc91.06k-4.03m3.34m7.00------36.70-0.0899-0.08990.002-0.08170.09331.1057.09---412.65-183.16---317.664.28-10.81-4,421.58-2,229.560.4339-0.2478-----0.060688.91-50.11------Tikcro Technologies, Ltd.0.00-1.28m3.36m2.00--0.463-----0.2248-0.22480.000.73430.00-------15.90-7.49-16.35-7.66---------------------44.63------Capstone Therapeutics Corp0.00-671.00k3.59m2.00---------0.0164-0.01640.00-0.01250.00-------140.92-52.23-197.44-54.52-----------18.612.04------76.07------Generex Biotechnology Corporation0.00-59.65m3.74m8.00---------59.00-59.000.00-57.670.00-------922.32-100.83-----------81,893.510.1688-1.79---------27.25------Wholehealth Products Inc-100.00bn-100.00bn3.87m3.00---------------0.0021-----------253,284.20-------------------------22.96------Biostar Pharmaceuticals Inc1.58m-6.09m3.89m438.00--0.1064--2.46-2.89-2.890.658513.720.03454.420.1562---13.26-13.54-15.20-15.3736.0250.69-384.88-23.401.16-18.630.0608---91.21-51.8377.31------Resolute Oncology Inc251.35k-3.12m3.97m0.00------15.79-0.0781-0.07810.0031-0.01780.4207-------521.68------48.08---1,240.18-----918.0915.73-------363.15------Data as of --.
