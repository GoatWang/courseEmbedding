Tor prevents people from learning your location or browsing habits.
Tor is for web browsers, instant messaging clients, and more.
Tor is free and open source for Windows, Mac, Linux/Unix, and Android

Anonymity Online
Protect your privacy. Defend yourself against network surveillance and traffic analysis.


Download Tor




What is Tor? Tor is free software and an open
            network that helps you defend against traffic analysis,
            a form of network surveillance that
            threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business
            activities and relationships, and state security.
Learn
            more about Tor »



Why Anonymity Matters
Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a
          distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around
          the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet
          connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents
          the sites you visit from learning your physical location.
