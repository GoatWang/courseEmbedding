SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this
“Supplemental Indenture”), dated as of August 17,
2016, among AmSurg Corp., a Tennessee corporation (the
“Issuer”), the Subsidiary Guarantors identified on the
signature pages hereto (the “Subsidiary Guarantors”)
and U.S. Bank National Association (or its permitted successor), as
trustee under the Existing Indenture referred to below (the
“Trustee”).

W I T N E S S E T H:

WHEREAS, the Issuer, the Subsidiary
Guarantors and the Trustee have heretofore executed an Indenture,
dated as of July 16, 2014 (the “Original
Indenture”), providing for the issuance by the Issuer of
$1,100,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.625% Senior
Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”);

WHEREAS, the Original Indenture has
heretofore been supplemented to add additional Subsidiary
Guarantors (the Original Indenture, as so supplemented, is
hereinafter referred to as the “Existing
Indenture”);

WHEREAS, under Section 8.02 of
the Original Indenture, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors and
the Trustee may amend the Existing Indenture with the consent of
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of Notes
then outstanding voting as a single class pursuant to the terms set
forth therein; and

WHEREAS, Holders of a majority in
principal amount of Notes outstanding voting as a single class have
consented to the amendments set forth herein (the
“Consents”) in connection with the consent solicitation
of the Issuer commencing on August 8, 2016 with respect to the
Notes (the “Consent Solicitation”); and

WHEREAS, the Issuer and the
Subsidiary Guarantors desire to enter into this Supplemental
Indenture on the date set forth above for the purpose of making the
amendments set forth herein, which amendments will become operative
as set forth in Section 3 herein;

WHEREAS, all other conditions and
requirements necessary to make this Supplemental Indenture a valid,
binding and legal instrument enforceable in accordance with its
terms have been performed and fulfilled by the parties hereto, and
the execution and delivery thereof have been in all respects duly
authorized by the parties hereto.

NOW, THEREFORE, for and in
consideration of the foregoing premises, it is mutually covenanted
and agreed, for the equal and proportionate benefit of all Holders
of the Notes, as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS . For all
purposes of the Existing Indenture and this Supplemental Indenture,
except as otherwise expressly provided or unless the context
otherwise requires:

(a) References . The terms
“herein,” “hereof” and other words of
similar import refer to the Existing Indenture and this
Supplemental Indenture as a whole and not to any particular
article, section or other subdivision; and



(b) Capitalized Terms . All
capitalized terms used in this Supplemental Indenture but not
defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the Existing Indenture.

2. AMENDMENT OF CERTAIN
PROVISIONS OF ARTICLE 1 AND OTHER RELATED PROVISIONS OF THE
ORIGINAL INDENTURE .

(a) Amendment of
Section 1.01 of the Original Indenture . From and as of
the Operational Time (as defined in Section 3(b) of
this Supplemental Indenture), Section 1.01 of the Original
Indenture shall be amended by replacing the definition of
“Change of Control” set forth in the Original Indenture
in its entirety as follows:

“’Change of
Control’ means the occurrence of any of the following
events:
 



 


(a)


the Issuer
becomes aware that any “person” (as such term is used
in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or has become
the “beneficial owner” (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and
13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that for purposes of this
clause (a) such person shall be deemed to have
“beneficial ownership” of all shares that any such
person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable
immediately or only after the passage of time), directly or
indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the
Voting Stock of the Issuer;



 



 


(b)


the Issuer is
liquidated or dissolved or adopts a plan of liquidation or
dissolution;



 



 


(c)


the merger or
consolidation of the Issuer with or into another Person or the
merger of another Person with or into the Issuer, or the sale of
all or substantially all the assets of the Issuer (determined on a
consolidated basis) to another Person, other than a transaction
following which (i) in the case of a merger or consolidation
transaction, holders of securities that represented 100% of the
Voting Stock of the Issuer immediately prior to such transaction
(or other securities into which such securities are converted as
part of such merger or consolidation transaction) own directly or
indirectly at least a majority of the voting power of the Voting
Stock of the surviving Person in such merger or consolidation
transaction immediately after such transaction and (ii) in the
case of a sale of assets transaction, a transaction following which
each transferee becomes an obligor in respect of the Notes and a
Subsidiary of the transferor of such assets; and



 



 


(d)


the occurrence
of a “Change of Control” under the indenture governing
the 2020 Senior Notes (other than a Change of Control as a result
of the Envision Merger);




provided , however , that neither (x) the
merger of the Issuer into New Amethyst Corp., a Delaware
corporation (“New Amethyst”) nor (y) the merger of
Envision Healthcare Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(“Envision”) into New Amethyst, each pursuant to that
certain Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Issuer,
Envision, and New Amethyst, dated as of June 15, 2016
(collectively, the “Envision Merger”) will constitute a
Change of Control.”
 
2



(b) Amendment of
Section 1.01 of the Original Indenture . From and as of
the Operational Time, Section 1.01 of the Existing Indenture
shall be further amended by adding the following new terms and
definitions in the appropriate alphabetical order:

“’Limited Condition
Acquisition’ means any acquisition by one or more of the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries of any assets, business or
Person permitted by this Indenture whose consummation is not
conditioned on the availability of, or on obtaining, third party
financing.”

(c) Addition of Section 1.04
Limited Condition Acquisition to the Existing Indenture . From
and as of the Operational Time, the Existing Indenture is hereby
amended by adding the following Section 1.04
thereto:

“Section 1.04. Limited
Condition Acquisition . In connection with any action being
taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, for
purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this
Indenture which requires that no Default, Event of Default or
specified Event of Default, as applicable, has occurred, is
continuing or would result from any such action, as applicable,
such condition shall, at the option of the Issuer, be deemed
satisfied, so long as no Default, Event of Default or specified
Event of Default, as applicable, exists on the date the definitive
agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are entered into.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has exercised its option
under the first sentence of this Section 1.04, and any Default
or Event of Default occurs following the date the definitive
agreements for the applicable Limited Condition Acquisition were
entered into and prior to the consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition, any such Default or Event of Default shall
be deemed to not have occurred or be continuing for purposes of
determining whether any action being taken in connection with such
Limited Condition Acquisition is permitted hereunder.

In connection with any action being
taken in connection with a Limited Condition Acquisition, for
purposes of:

(i) determining compliance with any
provision of this Indenture which requires the calculation of the
Consolidated Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Secured Debt Ratio;
or

(ii) testing baskets set forth in
this Indenture (including baskets measured as a percentage of Total
Assets);

in each case, at the option of the
Issuer (the Issuer’s election to exercise such option in
connection with any Limited Condition Acquisition, an “LCA
Election”), the date of determination of whether any such
action is permitted hereunder, shall be deemed to be the date the
definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Acquisition are
entered into (the “LCA Test Date”), and if, after
giving pro forma effect to the Limited Condition Acquisition and
the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith
(including any Incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds
thereof) as if they had occurred at the beginning of the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters ending prior to the LCA
Test Date for which consolidated financial statements of the Issuer
are available, the Issuer could have taken such action on the
relevant LCA Test Date in compliance with such ratio or basket,
such ratio or basket shall be deemed to have been complied with.
For the avoidance of doubt, if the Issuer has made an LCA Election
and any of the ratios or baskets for which
 
3



compliance was determined or tested
as of the LCA Test Date are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
any such ratio or basket, including due to fluctuations in Total
Assets of the Issuer or the Person subject to such Limited
Condition Acquisition, at or prior to the consummation of the
relevant transaction or action, such baskets or ratios will not be
deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such fluctuations. If
the Issuer has made an LCA Election for any Limited Condition
Acquisition, then in connection with any subsequent calculation of
any ratio or basket availability with respect to the Incurrence of
Indebtedness or Liens, or the making of Restricted Payments,
mergers, the conveyance, lease or other transfer of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Issuer or the designation of
an Unrestricted Subsidiary on or following the relevant LCA Test
Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited
Condition Acquisition is consummated or the definitive agreement
for such Limited Condition Acquisition is terminated or expires
without consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition, any
such ratio or basket shall be calculated on a pro forma basis
assuming such Limited Condition Acquisition and other transactions
in connection therewith (including any Incurrence of Indebtedness
and the use of proceeds thereof) have been
consummated.”

(d) Amendment of Additional
Provisions of Existing Indenture . From and as of the
Operational Time, any and all additional provisions of the Existing
Indenture shall be deemed amended to reflect the intentions of the
amendments provided for in this Section 2 and elsewhere
herein.

3. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL
INDENTURE; OPERATION OF AMENDMENTS .

(a) Effect of Supplemental
Indenture . In accordance with Section 8.02 of the
Existing Indenture, upon the execution of this Supplemental
Indenture, the Existing Indenture shall be modified in accordance
herewith, and this Supplemental Indenture shall form a part of the
Existing Indenture for all purposes; and every Holder of the Notes
heretofore authenticated and delivered under the Existing Indenture
shall be bound hereby. Except as modified by this Supplemental
Indenture, the Existing Indenture and the Notes, and the rights of
the Holders of the Notes thereunder, shall remain unchanged and in
full force and effect.

(b) Operation of Amendments .
The provisions of this Supplemental Indenture shall not become
operative until the date and time (such date and time, the
“Operational Time”) the Issuer notifies (in writing)
The Depository Trust Company, as depositary for the Notes (the
“Depositary”), that the Issuer has purchased the
Consents and not withdrawn pursuant to the Consent Solicitation. In
the event the Issuer notifies (in writing) the Depositary that it
has withdrawn or terminated the Consent Solicitation prior to the
Operational Time, this Existing Indenture shall be terminated and
be of no force or effect and the Original Indenture shall not be
modified hereby. The Issuer shall promptly notify the Trustee in
writing of any notice it gives to the Depositary.

4. MATTERS CONCERNING THE
TRUSTEE . The Trustee accepts the trusts of the Existing
Indenture, as amended and supplemented by this Supplemental
Indenture, and agrees to perform the same, but only upon the terms
and conditions set forth in the Existing Indenture, as amended and
supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, to which the parties
hereto and the Holders from time to time of the Notes agree and,
except as expressly set forth in the Existing Indenture, as amended
and supplemented by this Supplemental Indenture, shall incur no
liability or responsibility in respect thereof. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the recitals
 
4


contained herein shall be taken as the
statements of the Issuer, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility
for their correctness, and the Trustee makes no representation as
to the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental Indenture or
any con
