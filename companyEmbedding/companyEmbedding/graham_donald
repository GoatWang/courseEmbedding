Donald Graham
Chairman
Donald Conway Graham is an industrialist and philanthropist.  He founded his first company, Graham Engineering, in a farmhouse basement in Central Pennsylvania in 1960 with one employee.  Today, The Graham Group consists of several investment firms and industrial companies.
Synopsis
      Don was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1933, and raised in a University of Michigan faculty family.  After graduating from the University of Michigan with two degrees, Don worked in a series of engineering and engineering management roles, both in industry and in the U.S. Army.  At age 27, he founded Graham Engineering.  The company’s activities grew from design engineering services to contract manufacturing to building integrated manufacturing systems and developing industrial technologies. Don ultimately established leadership positions domestically and internationally in three core industrial businesses which today employ thousands of people and generate several billion dollars in annual sales: plastic bottles and containers, commercial windows and window wall systems, and packaging machinery.  Each of the Graham businesses exemplifies Don’s vision of creating a sustainable competitive advantage in a market through industrial innovation and advanced manufacturing know-how, leveraging product substitution trends and raw materials conversion trends in the market segments Don pursued.  This strategic focus on industrial innovation and advanced manufacturing know-how persists today in all of The Graham Group’s investment platforms and throughout its industrial portfolio.  
Early Years
      Don was born on January 25, 1933 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where he grew up as part of the University of Michigan community.  His father, Samuel A. Graham, was a scientist and professor in what is now the University’s School of Natural Resources and Environment. Don’s mother, Sybil F. Graham, co-authored “American Problems: A Textbook in Social Progress,” which was used to develop unified curricula for social sciences in high schools around the United States.  Don was the youngest of four children.  As a youth, he worked multiple jobs and participated extensively in competitive athletics. 
Early in college, Don played American football and hockey.  He also worked as a machinist at a local manufacturer.  After injuries ended his goal of playing professional sports, Don focused on engineering.  While at the University of Michigan, Don was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society.  He was a member of the University of Michigan’s chapter of the American Society of Tool Engineers.  Don was also a member of the Engineering Honor Council.  Don graduated from the University of Michigan in 1955, earning a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering, followed with an MS degree in Industrial Engineering and Business Management in 1956.  He was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity.
Business Career
      Following graduation, Don worked in the engineering department at Baker Perkins in Saginaw, Michigan.  A stint in the U.S. Army brought Don to the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, where he earned a critical skills accreditation in the chemical weapons group.  He moved on to Read Machinery Corp. in York, PA (later Read Standard Corp.) as Chief Engineer for Specialty Products, and then went to Read’s parent company, Capitol Products, as Vice President of Technology.
Don left Capitol Products in 1960 to start Graham Engineering in the basement of a rented farmhouse in Dover, Pennsylvania with no capital and one employee.  Graham Engineering grew from a design services firm into a diversified group of advanced manufacturing companies with leading international positions in packaging machinery, plastics packaging and architectural window systems, which subsequently led to the formation of The Graham Group.
The Graham Group has since grown to include Graham Capital Company, Graham Partners, Inverness Graham Investments, Striker Partners and Graham Software Development.  The investment companies have in turn invested in over fifty companies in industrial technologies, packaging, water management, medical instruments and medical equipment, aerospace, electronics, food technologies, building products, communications, business services and information technologies.  
Don continues to be actively involved on portfolio company boards and works closely with management teams of portfolio companies, particularly when significant strategic changes or product development programs are involved for a company.  At age 83 he is fully engaged on almost a daily basis.  He also remains an avid golfer and skier.
Philanthropic Pursuits
      For decades, Don has provided significant leadership and financial support to the University of Michigan.  He serves on the current President’s Advisory Group, as he had served for the University’s prior two presidents.  Don founded the University’s Graham Sustainability Institute and the Graham Graduate Entrepreneurial Studies Program.  Don has actively supported numerous programs in the University’s School of Natural Resources over the years, including funding the Dean’s Chair, which is named in honor of Don’s father. He has also actively supported the College of Engineering, including serving on a National Advisory Board and funding the Nanotechnology Labs.  Moreover, Don has actively supported the Athletic Department, including funding several football and hockey scholarships as well as the Academic Success Program.
Committed supporters of educational, community, cultural and environmental projects, Don and his wife Ingrid have funded programs at many other institutions, including Dartmouth College, Williams College, York College of Pennsylvania (including the Graham Business School and the Graham Innovation Scholars Program), Penn State York (including the Graham Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership Studies), the University of Pennsylvania (including the Penn Museum), the York YMCA’s Graham Aquatic Center, and Burke Mountain Academy (including the Graham Family Endowment).
Don has been active in many professional groups, including the Young Presidents’ Organization, Chief Executives Organization, World Business Council, American Business Council and the Recycling Advisory Council, as well as serving on numerous corporate and philanthropic boards.  He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of Plastics Engineers (SPE).  Internationally, Don served as Chairman of the Trustees of the Mpala Wildlife Foundation for over 15 years and currently serves as Chairman Emeritus.
Family
      Don and Ingrid Graham have been married for over 58 years.  They have five children:  Steve, Kristi, Ken, Richie and Erik, as well as 17 grandchildren ages 6 to 27.  Despite the demands of building a growing group of companies, Don has consistently made his family his first priority.

Early life[edit]
Donald Edward Graham was born on April 22, 1945. His parents were Katharine Graham (née Meyer), later a publisher of The Washington Post, and her husband, Philip Graham.[2][3] His maternal grandmother, Agnes Meyer, was a German Lutheran.[2][3] His maternal grandfather, Eugene Meyer, was German Jewish and descended from a rabbinical family in Strasbourg. He bought the bankrupt Post shortly after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in mid-1933.[4] His mother was baptized as a Lutheran but attended an Episcopal church.[5] His father was also a Lutheran.[6]
Graham graduated from St. Albans School and then attended Harvard College. In 1965, he was elected president of The Harvard Crimson, the college's breakfast daily. After graduation in 1966, he volunteered for military service and served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. There "he worked as an information specialist with the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968." From January 1969 to June 1970, Graham joined the Washington Metropolitan Police Department as a patrolman and was sent to the Ninth Precinct in Northeast Washington. Graham excelled as a patrolman, despite the harsh conditions of the Ninth Precinct.
The Post[edit]
Eugene Meyer, Graham's maternal grandfather, bought The Washington Post at a bankruptcy sale in 1933. Graham's father was publisher of The Washington Post from 1946 until 1961 and president of the Washington Post Company from 1947 until his death in 1963. Graham's mother, Katharine, was the head of The Washington Post newspaper for more than two decades, overseeing its most famous period, the Watergate coverage that helped bring down President Richard Nixon. She has been widely described as one of the most powerful American women of the 20th century.
In 1971, Graham joined The Washington Post as a reporter, and went on to hold various news and business positions at the Post and Newsweek (until 2010, owned by The Washington Post Company).
He was elected to the board of the company in September 1974 and was made executive vice president and general manager of the Post in 1976. Graham became publisher of The Washington Post in 1979, succeeding his mother, who retained her corporate positions of chairman of the board and CEO of The Washington Post Company. The Company owns the newspaper, as well as the educational services provider Kaplan, Inc., Post-Newsweek Stations, Cable One, Slate magazine, and other smaller companies. Donald Graham became CEO in 1991 and chairman of the company in May 1993, while Katharine Graham assumed the position of chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company.
In 1994, Graham was responsible for “a heavy blow to the newspaper’s credibility” (WaPo ombudsman on October 9, 1994), when he successfully lobbied Senator John Danforth for a special provision, favoring Washington Post Co.'s cell phone holdings, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty. A Washington Post editorial had described the treaty as including "no surprises", igniting heavy criticism from rival companies. The Washington Post had to apologize and Graham later said about the conspiracy: “In hindsight, there should have been an editorial that mentioned this provision in the GATT treaty. We clearly should have done that.” He also offered an insight into the difficult balance between the interests of the newspaper and that of the holding company: “We run a business and make no apologies for the fact that we try to run it well.”
In September 2000, Graham was elected chairman of the newspaper and passed the position of publisher to Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr.
Other roles[edit]
Graham also served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board between 2001 and 2010. He is on the board of the District of Columbia College Access Program and a trustee of the Federal City Council in Washington, D.C. Graham was also formerly a member of the board of directors of the Summit Fund of Washington.
He is also an invitee of the Bilderberg Group and attended conference meetings in Greece 2009,[7] and Spain 2010.[8]
Personal life[edit]
In 1967, Graham married Mary Wissler. Wissler earned a law degree from Georgetown University and a bachelor's from Harvard-Radcliffe, where she met Graham. She is a research fellow at the Kennedy School's Taubman Center at Harvard focusing on such issues as health and safety regulations. In 2007, they announced that they were separating.[9] They have four children.
On June 30, 2012, he married Amanda Bennett, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and a colleague from the Pulitzer Prize Board.[10]
His daughter Laura is married to Tim O'Shaughnessy[11], former CEO of LivingSocial, and current president of Graham Holdings Company.

Early life[edit]
Donald Edward Graham was born on April 22, 1945. His parents were Katharine Graham (née Meyer), later a publisher of The Washington Post, and her husband, Philip Graham.[2][3] His maternal grandmother, Agnes Meyer, was a German Lutheran.[2][3] His maternal grandfather, Eugene Meyer, was German Jewish and descended from a rabbinical family in Strasbourg. He bought the bankrupt Post shortly after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in mid-1933.[4] His mother was baptized as a Lutheran but attended an Episcopal church.[5] His father was also a Lutheran.[6]
Graham graduated from St. Albans School and then attended Harvard College. In 1965, he was elected president of The Harvard Crimson, the college's breakfast daily. After graduation in 1966, he volunteered for military service and served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. There "he worked as an information specialist with the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968." From January 1969 to June 1970, Graham joined the Washington Metropolitan Police Department as a patrolman and was sent to the Ninth Precinct in Northeast Washington. Graham excelled as a patrolman, despite the harsh conditions of the Ninth Precinct.
The Post[edit]
Eugene Meyer, Graham's maternal grandfather, bought The Washington Post at a bankruptcy sale in 1933. Graham's father was publisher of The Washington Post from 1946 until 1961 and president of the Washington Post Company from 1947 until his death in 1963. Graham's mother, Katharine, was the head of The Washington Post newspaper for more than two decades, overseeing its most famous period, the Watergate coverage that helped bring down President Richard Nixon. She has been widely described as one of the most powerful American women of the 20th century.
In 1971, Graham joined The Washington Post as a reporter, and went on to hold various news and business positions at the Post and Newsweek (until 2010, owned by The Washington Post Company).
He was elected to the board of the company in September 1974 and was made executive vice president and general manager of the Post in 1976. Graham became publisher of The Washington Post in 1979, succeeding his mother, who retained her corporate positions of chairman of the board and CEO of The Washington Post Company. The Company owns the newspaper, as well as the educational services provider Kaplan, Inc., Post-Newsweek Stations, Cable One, Slate magazine, and other smaller companies. Donald Graham became CEO in 1991 and chairman of the company in May 1993, while Katharine Graham assumed the position of chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company.
In 1994, Graham was responsible for “a heavy blow to the newspaper’s credibility” (WaPo ombudsman on October 9, 1994), when he successfully lobbied Senator John Danforth for a special provision, favoring Washington Post Co.'s cell phone holdings, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty. A Washington Post editorial had described the treaty as including "no surprises", igniting heavy criticism from rival companies. The Washington Post had to apologize and Graham later said about the conspiracy: “In hindsight, there should have been an editorial that mentioned this provision in the GATT treaty. We clearly should have done that.” He also offered an insight into the difficult balance between the interests of the newspaper and that of the holding company: “We run a business and make no apologies for the fact that we try to run it well.”
In September 2000, Graham was elected chairman of the newspaper and passed the position of publisher to Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr.
Other roles[edit]
Graham also served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board between 2001 and 2010. He is on the board of the District of Columbia College Access Program and a trustee of the Federal City Council in Washington, D.C. Graham was also formerly a member of the board of directors of the Summit Fund of Washington.
He is also an invitee of the Bilderberg Group and attended conference meetings in Greece 2009,[7] and Spain 2010.[8]
Personal life[edit]
In 1967, Graham married Mary Wissler. Wissler earned a law degree from Georgetown University and a bachelor's from Harvard-Radcliffe, where she met Graham. She is a research fellow at the Kennedy School's Taubman Center at Harvard focusing on such issues as health and safety regulations. In 2007, they announced that they were separating.[9] They have four children.
On June 30, 2012, he married Amanda Bennett, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and a colleague from the Pulitzer Prize Board.[10]
His daughter Laura is married to Tim O'Shaughnessy[11], former CEO of LivingSocial, and current president of Graham Holdings Company.

From January 1969 to June 1970, Graham joined the Washington Metropolitan Police Department as a patrolman and was sent to the Ninth Precinct in Northeast Washington. Graham excelled as a patrolman, despite the harsh conditions of the Ninth Precinct.
The Post[edit]
Eugene Meyer, Graham's maternal grandfather, bought The Washington Post at a bankruptcy sale in 1933. Graham's father was publisher of The Washington Post from 1946 until 1961 and president of the Washington Post Company from 1947 until his death in 1963.

He was elected to the board of the company in September 1974 and was made executive vice president and general manager of the Post in 1976. Graham became publisher of The Washington Post in 1979, succeeding his mother, who retained her corporate positions of chairman of the board and CEO of The Washington Post Company. The Company owns the newspaper, as well as the educational services provider Kaplan, Inc., Post-Newsweek Stations, Cable One, Slate magazine, and other smaller companies. Donald Graham became CEO in 1991 and chairman of the company in May 1993, while Katharine Graham assumed the position of chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company.

Early life[edit]
Donald Edward Graham was born on April 22, 1945. His parents were Katharine Graham (née Meyer), later a publisher of The Washington Post, and her husband, Philip Graham.[2][3] His maternal grandmother, Agnes Meyer, was a German Lutheran.[2][3] His maternal grandfather, Eugene Meyer, was German Jewish and descended from a rabbinical family in Strasbourg. He bought the bankrupt Post shortly after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve in mid-1933.[4] His mother was baptized as a Lutheran but attended an Episcopal church.[5] His father was also a Lutheran.[6]
Graham graduated from St. Albans School and then attended Harvard College. In 1965, he was elected president of The Harvard Crimson, the college's breakfast daily. After graduation in 1966, he volunteered for military service and served in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968. There "he worked as an information specialist with the 1st Cavalry Division in Vietnam from 1967 to 1968." From January 1969 to June 1970, Graham joined the Washington Metropolitan Police Department as a patrolman and was sent to the Ninth Precinct in Northeast Washington. Graham excelled as a patrolman, despite the harsh conditions of the Ninth Precinct.
The Post[edit]
Eugene Meyer, Graham's maternal grandfather, bought The Washington Post at a bankruptcy sale in 1933. Graham's father was publisher of The Washington Post from 1946 until 1961 and president of the Washington Post Company from 1947 until his death in 1963. Graham's mother, Katharine, was the head of The Washington Post newspaper for more than two decades, overseeing its most famous period, the Watergate coverage that helped bring down President Richard Nixon. She has been widely described as one of the most powerful American women of the 20th century.
In 1971, Graham joined The Washington Post as a reporter, and went on to hold various news and business positions at the Post and Newsweek (until 2010, owned by The Washington Post Company).
He was elected to the board of the company in September 1974 and was made executive vice president and general manager of the Post in 1976. Graham became publisher of The Washington Post in 1979, succeeding his mother, who retained her corporate positions of chairman of the board and CEO of The Washington Post Company. The Company owns the newspaper, as well as the educational services provider Kaplan, Inc., Post-Newsweek Stations, Cable One, Slate magazine, and other smaller companies. Donald Graham became CEO in 1991 and chairman of the company in May 1993, while Katharine Graham assumed the position of chairman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company.
In 1994, Graham was responsible for “a heavy blow to the newspaper’s credibility” (WaPo ombudsman on October 9, 1994), when he successfully lobbied Senator John Danforth for a special provision, favoring Washington Post Co.'s cell phone holdings, in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) treaty. A Washington Post editorial had described the treaty as including "no surprises", igniting heavy criticism from rival companies. The Washington Post had to apologize and Graham later said about the conspiracy: “In hindsight, there should have been an editorial that mentioned this provision in the GATT treaty. We clearly should have done that.” He also offered an insight into the difficult balance between the interests of the newspaper and that of the holding company: “We run a business and make no apologies for the fact that we try to run it well.”
In September 2000, Graham was elected chairman of the newspaper and passed the position of publisher to Boisfeuillet Jones, Jr.
Other roles[edit]
Graham also served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board between 2001 and 2010. He is on the board of the District of Columbia College Access Program and a trustee of the Federal City Council in Washington, D.C. Graham was also formerly a member of the board of directors of the Summit Fund of Washington.
He is also an invitee of the Bilderberg Group and attended conference meetings in Greece 2009,[7] and Spain 2010.[8]
Personal life[edit]
In 1967, Graham married Mary Wissler. Wissler earned a law degree from Georgetown University and a bachelor's from Harvard-Radcliffe, where she met Graham. She is a research fellow at the Kennedy School's Taubman Center at Harvard focusing on such issues as health and safety regulations. In 2007, they announced that they were separating.[9] They have four children.
On June 30, 2012, he married Amanda Bennett, a senior editor at Bloomberg News, a former editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer, and a colleague from the Pulitzer Prize Board.[10]
His daughter Laura is married to Tim O'Shaughnessy[11], former CEO of LivingSocial, and current president of Graham Holdings Company.

Don Graham








Biography of Donald Graham
                    






Education

Education
Don graduated from the University of Michigan, earning a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1955 and an MS degree in Industrial Engineering and Business Management in 1956. He was a member of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity. Don was inducted into Tau Beta Pi, the national engineering honor society, as well as a member of the U-M chapter of the American Society of Tool Engineers. Don was also a member of the Engineering Honor Council, which oversees the administration of the College of Engineering Honor Code.
Don is a registered Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania.
Don has received honorary doctoral degrees from the University of Michigan and York College of Pennsylvania for his many accomplishments and contributions to benefit the institutions.





Business background

The making of an innovator
Don's work and business life began as a young boy delivering newspapers, cleaning toilets and setting bowling pins at the University of Michigan Student Union, fixing and selling old cars, and later working as a machinist at Electro Arc Corp.
After college, Don's professional life started with Baker Perkins in Saginaw, Michigan. A stint in the Army brought Don to the Edgewood Arsenal in Maryland, where he earned a critical skills accreditation in the chemical weapons group. He moved on to Read Machinery Corp. in York, Pennsylvania (later Read Standard Corp.) as Chief Engineer for Specialty Products, and then went to Read's parent company, Capitol Products, as Vice President of Technology.
Don left Capitol Products in 1960 to start Graham Engineering in the basement of a rented farmhouse in Dover, Pennsylvania with no capital and one employee. Graham Engineering grew from a design services firm into a diversified group of custom manufacturing companies with leading international positions in specialty machinery, plastic packaging and architectural window systems, which subsequently led to the formation of The Graham Group.
The Graham Group has since grown to include Graham Capital Company, Graham Partners, Inverness Graham Investments, Striker Partners and Graham Software Development. The investment companies have in turn invested in over thirty companies in building products, packaging, medical instruments, aerospace, electronics, communications, business services and information technologies.
Still located in York, Pennsylvania are Graham Packaging, Graham Engineering, Graham Architectural Products and Graham Capital, however the Graham Group has a wide geographic reach that until recently included Berry Plastics, which is listed on the NY Stock Exchange, and for which Don served on the Board of Directors. In 2011 Graham Group sold its last holdings in Graham Packaging which had by then grown to over $3.5 billion in annual sales.

Franklin Graham: Donald Trump Won Election by the ‘Hand of God’
 Reuters
by Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.31 Dec 20160 31 Dec, 2016
31 Dec, 2016


Celebrated evangelical Rev. Franklin Graham says that it was the “hand of God,” rather than Russian hackers, that determined the outcome of November’s presidential election.
“I think maybe God has allowed Donald Trump to win this election to protect this nation for the next few years by giving maybe an opportunity to have some good judges,” he said.advertisement
The son of renowned Baptist minister Billy Graham, the Rev. Franklin Graham has been invited by President-elect Trump to be one of six clergy to offer the invocation, benediction, and several readings at his swearing-in ceremony on January 20.
In an interview with Religion News Service Thursday, Graham said that beyond mere human factors, the mysterious hand of divine providence was at work in the elections.
“All I know is Donald Trump was supposed to lose the election” according to all the polls, Graham said.
“For these states to go the way they did, in my opinion, I think it was the hand of God,” he said. “It wasn’t hacking. It wasn’t Wiki-leaky or whatever. It was God, in my opinion, and I believe his hand was at work, and I think he’s given Christians an opportunity.”

While never officially endorsing Trump, Rev. Graham has been a sharp critic of the Obama administration and a vocal opponent of Hillary Clinton, especially for her uncompromising support of abortion-on-demand.
Shortly before Election Day, Graham declared that the best choice for president “isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian,” in evident reference to Republican candidate Donald Trump.
“There’s two different pictures and two different visions for America,” Graham said in early November. “The Democratic Party has a vision, Hillary Clinton has a vision, Donald Trump has a totally different vision for this nation with the Republican Party. This isn’t difficult to figure out if you are a Christian.”
The evangelist acknowledged that for many, voting for Trump might not have been easy, but he insisted that it was, nonetheless, the better choice and that Trump was a “changed man.”
“You may have to hold your nose and vote,” Graham said. “I have people that say, ‘Well I don’t like Donald Trump, I don’t like what he says.’ Well I don’t like what he said either, I promise I don’t like it. But those are things that he said 11 years ago, not something that he said today.”

“I think Donald Trump has changed,” Graham added. “I think God is working on his heart and in his life. But people have to make up their own mind.”
In a Facebook post some weeks earlier, Graham had stated that “the difference between the candidates is night and day.”
“Some candidates have entire political ads talking about how they spent their career fighting for the rights of children,” he said. “Yet they spent their entire career fighting against the rights of unborn children!”
Graham said Hillary Clinton’s progressive agenda was “godless” and could not be defended.
Following WikiLeaks revelations, the preacher denounced the “depth of corruption” in Washington politics, calling for its eradication.

“WikiLeaks is giving us a much clearer picture of the depth of the corruption that is thriving in our nation’s capital,” Graham wrote, calling it “a swamp that needs to be drained.”
“Our political system is broken, and it will take strong, tough leadership to begin fixing some of this,” Graham said.
Regarding the inauguration ceremony, Graham says he still has not decided which Scripture passage to read.
“I’m taking time just to pray and ask God to give me wisdom and guidance because it’s a responsibility that I take very seriously,” he said.

				Is a New Cultural Agenda Possible Under Trump?



					10:10AM EDT 7/14/2017				

Steve Strang 





Evangelical leaders pray for President Donald Trump. (Mike Segar / Reuters )



Americans who grew up in the 1950s—or whose early lives were shaped by people from that era—tend to look back on that decade as not only a wonderful season of American prosperity but as a time of moral righteousness on a national level.Many Americans remember it as a time when there were no disputes about right and wrong, good and evil. Everybody tended to agree on such things. Some individuals had a more liberal perspective, but no one was preaching rebellion against the overall moral code.Respected journalist David Aikman articulated this very well in an op-ed published recently on charismanews.com. I've known Aikman, now retired, since the 1970s when he was a senior foreign correspondent for Time magazine. He says America had a civic religion in those days—a basic Christian morality reinforced by the preaching of evangelists like Billy Graham.Donald Trump was a product of that era. He grew up a nominal Christian with traditional moral values. It was only later that he became more libertarian on matters such as homosexuality."After the campus upheavals and the anti-war movement of the 1960s," Aikman says, "the entire culture began to experience a shift that introduced new worldviews, in Hollywood, academia and the media." Constant pressure from the left as well as the explosion of hedonism and self-gratification in the 1970s and 1980s escalated the pace of moral change.In 2017, Aikman said, "America has undergone seven decades during which the existence of God has been repeatedly mocked or utterly dismissed on college campuses and in public schools." While Donald Trump has never said anything about wanting to change American culture, his numerous attacks on political correctness endeared him to evangelical voters. After the election, many Christians began to think President Trump might be favorable to any grassroots movement seeking to make America morally great once again.Part of Trump's appeal to Christians, of course, was simply that he wasn't Hillary. Mike Bickle, founder of the International House of Prayer, told me, "When it came down to Trump or Hillary, there was no question." Even though Trump was saying outrageous things that would have destroyed any other candidate, the people loved him.Aikman says if Hillary had been elected, it would have been not only a continuation of America's lurch to the left but the doorway to a new era of corruption like nothing we have ever seen. It would have made the hope of renewal and restoration many Christians were praying for much harder to achieve.Evangelist James Robison told me in a recent telephone interview, "A lot of Christians were praying that we wouldn't lose freedom, that we would not lose the opportunities this nation offers." Robison, who serves on the president's faith advisory board, has become Trump's friend and confidant and now believes his election was an answer to prayer.Meanwhile, the secular pundits saw Trump's victory as only a battle between Democrat and Republican or left and right. But Robison saw it as a supernatural spiritual battle."What happened," Robison told me, "is that God overpowered the foolishness of political correctness and the liberal (not just deceived but possessed) left, which is far too often deadset against a biblical worldview. ... But they were being totally pushed back."The secular left in this country, Robison said, are being manipulated by powers Jesus was talking about when He said of those who crucified Him, "They don't know what they're doing" (see Luke 23:34). The left knew what they were doing, but "they were deceived by the deceiver," Robison said.Christians were praying, "God, we've got to let you be God. We've got to stop this nonsense." Robison added, "Christians were praying for this to be stopped, but they never dreamed it would be some person totally disconnected with politics, totally unable to even express himself like a politician and someone who was best known as a shrewd maneuverer."Trump may not have handled things in the most diplomatic way, Robison said, but he spoke with conviction about what's wrong in this country."He was totally open about everything that was wrong. Most of us would agree that he didn't address those problems in the most diplomatic terms, but everything he was saying was right on track. He was saying that many things in this country are bad, and they needed to be dealt with—and he was 100 percent correct."
