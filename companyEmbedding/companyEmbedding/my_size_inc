It began with an idea
The idea for MySizeID is the brainchild of the company’s founders. While shopping online for clothes, they were frustrated with the “hit or miss” fit of different brands, and this frustration was augmented by the return process. A serial entrepreneur, Ronen and his colleague reasoned that returns to retailers are a costly part of their business model, and upon looking at the problem from both sides, inspiration struck!
The ecommerce market
Consumers are spending more time online, due to the growth of tablets and smartphones, and as a result, ecommerce is expected to increase 13% to $262 billion this year, according to market research firm Forrester. This growth is expected to reach $370 billion in sales by 2017. At the same time, retailers increasing their investment in online sales divisions, enabling customers to research purchases, find stores and to find the best prices available and make purchases.
Comparing products and finding the right price are important for buying products like electronics or furniture, but the “grey area” in this dynamic, symbiotic commerce relationship is online clothing shopping, particularly, getting the size and fit that are right when choosing from thousands of online retailers and their manufacturers.
MySizeID’s Solution
MySize ID is a win-win solution for online consumers and retailers. MySizeId lets consumers create a secure, online profile of their personal measurements, which can then be utilized with partnered online retailers to insure that no matter the manufacturer or size chart, they will always get the right fit. For online retailers, MySizeID offers a solution that can significantly reduce returns from online purchases, which will in turn, increase margins and ultimately result in higher brand loyalty.

Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research
•  Prototype development
•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation
•  Invention presentation
•  Licensing negotiation
•  License agreement administration



So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!
