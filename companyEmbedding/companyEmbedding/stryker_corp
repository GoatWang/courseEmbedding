Stryker Acquires SafeWire Product Portfolio for Use in 
      Minimally-Invasive (MIS) Spine Procedures




Technology Used with Stryker’s Percutaneous ES2 Spinal Fixation 
      System & LITe (Less Invasive Technologies) Procedural Solutions






April 11, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ALLENDALE, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Stryker’s Spine division today announced the acquisition of the SafeWire 
      product portfolio, including the Y-Wire guidewire and Tiger Jamshidi 
      Needle Family for use in minimally invasive spine surgery. The 
      acquisition is highly complementary to Stryker’s current spine product 
      portfolio and is aligned with the Spine division’s strategy of expanding 
      its product offering for minimally-invasive spine surgery.
    


      Acquired from SafeWire, the Y-Wire features a patented feature that is 
      designed to mitigate potential wire-based complications, such as 
      inadvertent advancement of the guidewire through bone, accidental 
      pullout, kinking, or wire migration. In addition, with reduced surgical 
      steps and technical ease, the Y-Wire helps to optimize workflow for 
      minimally invasive spine cases, and to significantly reduce patient and 
      surgeon exposure to fluoroscopy.1


      Brad Paddock, president of Stryker’s Spine division, said the 
      introduction of the SafeWire portfolio reflects Stryker’s ongoing 
      commitment to patient safety and to providing surgeons with innovative 
      technology needed to treat patients undergoing minimally-invasive spine 
      surgery. “We are excited to bring this important complementary 
      technology into the Stryker family,” Paddock said. “This acquisition 
      increases our competitive advantage as we broaden our product line and 
      extend our customer base among teaching facilities, competitive 
      accounts, and existing SafeWire customers.”

Stryker Poised on Solid Product Portfolio and Acquisitions


July 18, 2017, 10:05:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 On Jul 17, we issued an updated research report on Kalamazoo, MI-based Stryker Corporation SYK  , one of the largest medical device companies in the global orthopedic market. The company currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company has a diversified product portfolio which cushions it against any significant sales shortfall during economic downturns. Stryker's pipeline includes products for Hip, Knee and Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgeries. MAKO results in the last quarter were solid, with almost 18 global robot installations, of which 11 were in the U.S. Furthermore, the platforms of bone cement, sports-medicine, bones substitute, soft tissue repair, trauma and extremities, endoscopy and more fortify the company's market position. Stryker has been following an acquisition-driven strategy to boost its growth profile. In June, the company announced a definitive agreement to acquire NOVADAQ Technologies Inc. for $11.75 per share, or $701 million with a net purchase price of $654 million. The transaction is structured as an arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act and is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by NOVADAQ's shareholders. Additionally, the acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control added $245 million to the company's net sales in the last quarter. Stryker has been focusing on international growth as well. In particular, the company's Medsurg product line has witnessed strong demand in the European and Australian markets in the first quarter of 2017. On the flip side, China might prove to be a challenging market. Stryker's strong guidance is also a catalyst. For the second quarter of 2017, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.48-$1.52 per share. For the full year, the company estimates adjusted earnings in the band of $6.35-$6.45. Stryker expects organic sales growth of 5.5% to 6.5% for full-year 2017. Over the last six months, the stock represented a strong return of 18.6%, higher than the Zacks classified Medical - Products  sub-industry's gain of 17.3%. The current level is also significantly higher than the S&P 500's return of 8.9% over the same time frame.     Other Key Picks  A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW  , CryoLife, Inc. CRY  and EDAP TMS SA EDAP  . Notably, EDAP TMS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Edwards Lifesciences and CryoLife have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see  the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here  .  EDAP TMS represents an impressive return of 37.05% for the last three months. The company delivered a solid earnings surprise of 533.3% in the last reported quarter. Edwards Lifesciences has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 15.2%. Notably, the stock represents an impressive one-year return of 9.6%. CryoLife yielded a strong return of 9.6% over the last one month. The stock delivered a positive earnings surprise of 80% in the last reported quarter.  5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump   Policies  If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]
Corporate governance[edit]
As of 2014, members of the board of directors of Stryker Corporation are:[6]

In Jan 2011, Stryker acquired the Neurovascular Division of Boston Scientific, which includes products used for the minimally invasive treatment of hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. In June 2011, Stryker purchased Malvern, Pennsylvania-based Orthovita, a biomaterials company specializing in bone augmentation and substitution technologies. The Orthovita business now makes up the Stryker Orthobiologics division, which specializes in biomaterials for all Stryker divisions.[8] In July 2011, Stryker completed the acquisition of privately held Memometal Technologies S.A.. France based Memometal develops, manufactures and markets products for extremity indications based on its proprietary methods for preparing and manufacturing a shape memory metal alloy.[9] In August 2011, Stryker signed a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Concentric Medical, Inc. in an all-cash transaction for $135 million.

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.

In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Stryker is also a major sponsor of a FIRST Robotics team, #2767 "Stryke Force", out of Kalamazoo. Originally known as "FLEET", the name was changed to reflect the generous sponsorship from Stryker.
Regulatory controversies[edit]
On Jan 27, 2000, Stryker Corporation restated its operating results for the year ended December 31, 1998, to reduce acquisition-related charges by $30.9 million.[24]
Since early 2007, the company has received three warning letters from the Food & Drug Administration citing issues in compliancy.[25][26] The first of these, a seven-page correspondence, named various issues at an Irish manufacturing facility, such as untimely fix of failures and procedural noncompliance in the testing of failed or otherwise problem-prone devices.[27] The second, sent November 2007, cites issues at the firm's Mahwah, New Jersey, facility, including poor fixation of hip implant components, in some instances requiring mitigation by revision surgeries; exceeded microbial level violations in the cleaning and final packaging areas of the sterile implants; and failure to institute measures in prevention of recurrence of these and other problems.[28] The final warning letter, sent April 2008, cites issues at the firm's Hopkinton, MA biotechnology facility. Again, issues relate to quality and noncompliance including falsification of documents relevant to the selling of products to hospitals which are to be sold under a limited, government-mandated basis. Stryker maintains that employees involved in the falsification of documents have since been terminated.[29]
In the Fall of 2007, Stryker, along with the related companies: Biomet, Zimmer Holdings, DePuy Orthopaedics and Smith & Nephew, were involved in civil ligation with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General. This litigation called for a net payout of $311 million as the governmental department maintains the aforementioned companies engaged in unlawful kickbacks to physicians who urged hospitals to purchase their respective products. Stryker, however, having cooperated early in the investigation, was not fined.[30]
As of February 2008, a dispute exists between Stryker Corp. and the U.S. Department of Justice concerning a subpoena linking the company to aforementioned misconduct in sale of products. Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

Business segments[edit]
Stryker segregates their reporting into three reportable business segments: Orthopedics, Medical and Surgical (MedSurg), and Neurotechnology and Spine.
Orthopedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. MedSurg products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling and emergency medical equipment (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices as well as other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Stryker Neurotechnology and Spine products include a portfolio of products including both neurosurgical and neurovascular devices. Their neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques, as well as a line of products for traditional brain and open skull base surgical procedures, orthobiologic and biosurgery products including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products, as well as minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Stryker also develops, manufactures and markets spinal implant products including cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies.[1]
History[edit]
The Orthopedic Frame Company, the precursor of Stryker Corporation, was formed on February 20, 1946, by Dr. Homer Stryker, a Kalamazoo, Michigan, orthopedist. Stryker developed the Turning Frame, a mobile hospital bed that allowed for repositioning of injured patients while providing necessary body immobility; the cast cutter, a cast cutting apparatus that removed cast material without damaging underlying tissues; and the walking heel, among others. In 1964, the company name was officially changed to Stryker Corporation.[2]
In 1979, Stryker made an initial public offering of stock and later acquired Osteonics Corporation, entering the replacement hip, knee, and other orthopedic implants market (Stryker). In 1999 annual sales reached $2.1 billion, and in 2000 Stryker was included in the S&P 500 and the Forbes Platinum 400 for the first time. In 2002 sales reached $3.0 billion and Stryker was listed in the Fortune 500 for the first time.
In 2003, Stephen P. MacMillan joined Stryker as President and CEO. In 2005, annual sales reached $4.9 billion and John W. Brown transitioned to the single role of Chairman of the Board, a role he retired from in 2010,[3] while Steve MacMillan became President & CEO. By 2007, Stryker sold its Physiotherapy Associates division to private equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million. In February 2012, Mr. MacMillan resigned and Curt R. Hartman was named Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. William U. Parfet was named Non-Executive Chairman of the Board. On October 1, 2012, Mr. Kevin A. Lobo was appointed as President and Chief Executive Officer.
At the end of 2012, Stryker had approximately 22,000 global employees and annual sales of $8.7 billion. 35% of those sales were outside the U.S.




Stryker Roll-In-Stretcher


In a 2012 global market overview of top medical technology firms, Stryker was ranked number 10 with total portfolio sales in excess of $8.6 billion. Moreover, the firm maintains 35% worldwide reconstructive market share; 50% worldwide MedSurg market share; 15% worldwide Neurotechnology and Spine market share.[4]
The company was recognized by Hermann Simon as a role model for other small to medium-sized business in his book Hidden Champions.[5]
John Brown[edit]
Brown served as President, CEO and finally Chairman of the Board across a 32-year career with Stryker.[3] One report attributes Stryker's rise from a maker of hospital beds to a world-class medical technology company to Brown.[3] As of 2013[update], Brown's retained investment in Stryker placed him on the Forbes 400 list with a net worth of US$1,500,000,000.[3]

Since governmental filing of the injunction, Stryker notes that it has produced in excess of 300,000 pages of documentation in compliance with the mandate. U.S. Government counters, however, that the documentation was not proper in scope and format. Law officials expect the investigation to continue for several months.[31]
Stryker recalled several models of medical vacuums sold under the Neptune Waste Management System brand in June and September 2012. The devices, some of which had not been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, caused a fatal accident when the vacuum was mistakenly used to suction a passive drainage tube.[32][33]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersStryker CorporationStryker CorporationStryker Corporation is a medical technology company manufacturing products ranging from hospital beds to robot-assisted surgical devices. Problems with some of its metal-on-metal hips have led to lawsuits and a $1.4 billion settlement with patients injured by its faulty hip implants.Jump To TopicHistoryAcquisitionsRecalls & LawsuitsFederal InvestigationsInnovative FutureJump To TopicSelect TopicHistoryAcquisitionsRecalls & LawsuitsFederal InvestigationsInnovative FutureEstablished: 1941 (Incorporated as Orthopedic Frame Co. in 1946)
Headquarters: Kalamazoo, Michigan
Founder: Dr. Homer Stryker
Size: 33,000 employees
Popular Products: Triathlon and Scorpio knee systems, Mako robot assisted surgical technology, Accolade hip replacement systems
2016 Revenue: $11.3 Billion
Founded as a hospital bed manufacturer in a Michigan basement in 1941, Stryker reported $1.6 billion net income on $11.3 billion in sales for 2016. The company boasts more than 5,600 patents worldwide and sells its products in more than 100 countries.
The company is built around three divisions: Orthopaedics, MedSurg (medical and surgical devices) and Neurotechnology and Spine. Stryker is highly diversified and no single product line represented more than 15 percent of revenues in 2015.

Stryker’s largest segments were:

Medical instruments (MedSurg) – 15 percent of revenue
Knee replacements (Orthapaedics) – 14 percent
Endoscopy (MedSurg) – 14 percent
Hip replacements (Orthapaedics) – 13 percent
Trauma and extremities implants (Orthapaedics) – 13 percent


Stryker’s MedSurg unit dominates medical instruments sales in the U.S., holding a 35 percent share of the $5.5 billion market. The company’s operating room equipment can be found in roughly 3,000 American hospitals and includes power tools for surgery, fluid and waste extraction, and computer and robot-assisted surgical devices.
Orthopaedics — hip, knee, ankle and trauma implants — accounted for 43 percent of Stryker’s sales in 2015, the most of any of the three sectors. The company held 22 percent of the hip-replacement market in the U.S. and 20 percent of knee-implant market, making it the third largest player in each.
In May 2017, Stryker announced it would begin issuing payments to about 3,000 people injured by two models of its hip implants as part of a $1.4 billion court settlement the company agreed to in late 2016. Starting at $300,000 per failed implant, the individual payments may be higher depending on the number and types of complications patients suffered.
Stryker: From Bed Builder to Diverse Medical Technology Company
In 1940, Dr. Homer Stryker rented space in Kalamazoo, Michigan’s Borgess Hospital to set up an orthopedics practice. He used a basement room to work on ideas for medical tools.
One of his first inventions was something he called a “turning frame.” It was a hospital bed that allowed doctors to reposition patients as needed while keeping the patient immobilized. The bed was popular with doctors and hospitals that started placing orders, and Stryker hired his first employee to manufacture it in 1941.
In 1946, Stryker incorporated his business as the Orthopedic Frame Company featuring just four products: the turning frame, a walking heel for casts, a surgical traction device and a cast cutter.
Removing casts remained a difficult and time consuming process. In 1947, Dr. Stryker hit on an idea for an oscillating saw using the motor from a malted milk mixer. The device could quickly slice through hard casts, but its blade did not cut skin. It was the beginning of Stryker’s move into medical technology devices.

Stryker’s oscillating saw
Stryker’s oscillating saw to remove hard casts was his beginning move into medical technology devices.

In 1958, the Orthopedic Frame Company recorded its first year of more than $1 million in sales. The company had 60 employees and about 90 percent of its products were the result of Dr. Stryker’s own inventiveness.
In 1964, the company changed its name to Stryker Corporation and Dr. Stryker finally retired from his medical practice, devoting full attention to being chairman.
The next 15 years saw major growth as Stryker began expansion into international markets, started acquiring other companies, and issued an initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ.
Dr. Stryker died in 1980. The company he started in a basement nearly 40 years earlier reached $36 million in sales and established the forerunners to its current divisions that same year. In the decades after its founder’s death, Stryker would focus on international expansion, developing new technology and acquiring other companies.
Innovation and Acquisitions Make Stryker a Global Medical Device Leader
In the 1980s, Stryker acquired SynOptics, allowing an entry into endoscopy markets, rolled out the first cordless, heavy-duty power tools for orthopedics and marketed the first liquid-proof surgical video camera and the first 3-chip medical video camera providing higher quality resolution than previous surgical cameras.
In 1990, Stryker’s annual sales hit $280 million.
In the 1990s, the company expanded into Canada, Latin America, Japan, China and Hong Kong and continued opening new offices in Europe. In 1996, Stryker acquired Swiss company Osteo, allowing Stryker to enter the orthopedic trauma market.
One of the company’s most important turning points came in 1998, when Stryker acquired Pfizer’s Howmedica division for $1.65 billion — the largest business transaction in Stryker’s history.


The purchase of Pfizer’s Howmedica division nearly doubled Stryker’s size and sent the company’s annual sales ballooning to $1.9 billion a year.

Overnight, Stryker became one of the biggest players in the global medical technology industry. In 2002, Stryker made the Fortune 500 for the first time with $3 billion in annual sales. During the early 2000s, the company continued expansion to new countries across Europe and entry into other fields such as pain intervention, surgical navigation and surgical waste management. It also created lines of hip and knee replacement implants specifically designed for the Japanese market.
Between 2010 and 2015, Stryker closed more than 40 acquisitions of other companies or divisions. It spent more than $4 billion dollars to acquire two more companies in 2016. Annual sales topped the $10 billion mark for the first time when the company posted $11.3 billion in sales for 2016.
Stryker Hip Implants Have Been Subject to Recalls and Lawsuits
Amid all its growth and innovation, some of Stryker’s products have led to expensive recalls and court settlements.
In 2012, Stryker recalled more than 50,000 of its Rejuvenate and AGB II modular hip stems after people implanted with the devices developed medical complications. Some components in the devices were made of a proprietary chromium-cobalt (Cr-Co) alloy. One of the symptoms people had were elevated levels of the two metals’ ions in their body.

Stryker modular hip components
The problems were connected to stress and corrosion where the implant components came in contact with one another. This caused the release of minute amounts of the metals, which studies linked to bone and tissue destruction. Stryker advised people with the devices to consult with their doctors even if they weren’t experiencing symptoms.
More than 3,000 lawsuits over the devices were combined in a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in a Minnesota federal court in 2013. MDLs allow similar lawsuits to move more quickly and efficiently through the legal system.
In 2016, the company agreed to a $1.4 billion settlement with plaintiffs. Individual compensation started with a $300,000 base payment with larger amounts for people who suffered additional complications or multiple surgeries.
In 2016, Stryker recalled another Cr-Co alloy hip component for a problem called “trunnionosis.” This was a condition in which small particles of the metals were released around a component called the trunnion. The erosion could damage bone and tissue and could even cause the device to fail when the components became “disassociated” from each other.
More than 42,000 components, called LFIT Anatomic Cobalt-Chromium V40 femoral heads (LFIT V40), were recalled.
In April 2017, six federal lawsuits over the LFIT V40 were combined in an MDL in a Massachusetts federal court. At least 27 other lawsuits filed at the time were expected to potentially join the MDL.
In May 2017, the New Jersey Supreme Court ordered all state lawsuits there consolidated into a multicounty litigation (MCL). At least 85 lawsuits had been filed in New Jersey by March 2017.
Stryker Cooperates with Federal Investigations into Company, Subsidiaries
In September 2007, Stryker was the only one of America’s five largest orthopedic implant manufacturers who escaped paying into a multi-million settlement with the federal government over allegations of kickbacks to doctors for using their products and costs being passed onto Medicare and Medicaid.


Zimmer, Inc., DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., Biomet Inc., and Smith & Nephew, Inc. all paid a portion of the $311 million settlement.

Stryker quickly cooperated with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation, led by then U.S. Attorney Chris Christie. While the company was not required to pay into the settlement, Stryker agreed to the same Non-Prosecution Agreement (NPA) as the other firms. The NPA required all five companies, which controlled 95 percent of the orthopedic implant market at the time, to implement reforms and agree to federal monitoring for 18 months.
Two months later, in November 2007, Stryker agreed to pay $16.6 million to the federal government to settle a DOJ investigation into a former subsidiary, Physiotherapy Associates. Stryker had sold the outpatient physical-therapy business to Chicago private-equity firm Water Street Healthcare Partners for $150 million in June 2007.
“Under the terms of the sale agreement, Stryker will retain responsibility for certain cash damages to be paid in connection with the previously announced investigation of Physiotherapy Associates’ billing and coding practices by the United States Department of Justice,” Stryker said in a statement at the time. “The company will continue to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice until this matter is ultimately resolved.”

Stryker corporate headquarters
The settlement resolved the federal government’s claims that Physiotherapy falsely billed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Defense Departments TRICARE health care programs for services.
In 2014, Stryker subsidiary OtisMed and its former CEO pleaded guilty in federal court to intentionally distributing knee-replacement related devices that had not been approved by the FDA. OtisMed paid more than $80 million in fines, criminal forfeitures and interest to the federal government. Former CEO Charlie Chi was sentenced to two years in prison for his role.
The illegal distribution happened before Stryker acquired OtisMed in November 2009 and Stryker cooperated with the DOJ investigation. But under terms of the conviction, the OtisMed subsidiary was banned from participating in Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and other federal health programs for 20 years. Stryker also agreed with federal prosecutors to comply with DOJ measures at the new acquisition to prevent future misconduct there.
Robotics, 3D Printing Featured in Stryker’s Future
Stryker’s future remains largely focused on innovation, a reflection of its founder’s own inventiveness. Stryker spent $715 million on R&D in 2016 and has spent 5 percent or more of its revenue on research and development each year since 2000. Its acquisitions have also focused on bringing in new technology developed by others. Some of Stryker’s most forward-looking innovations involve robotics and 3D printing.
In 2013, Stryker acquired orthopedic surgery robot maker Mako Surgical for $1.65 billion. The devices are designed to make surgery more precise for doctors and less painful for recovering patients.
The Mako system is used for planning knee-replacement surgery prior to the operation and assisting during surgery. The system creates a 3D model of how the knee implant will fit. Doctors are able to plan the procedure before ever entering the operating room, and adjust the fit of the implant to the patient. The system also assists the surgeon in precisely removing bone to implant the replacement knee.
Stryker reported installing 30 of the robots in the third quarter of 2016 alone, accounting for what the company called “75 percent year-over-year growth” in Mako system sales.
In 2017, Stryker introduced its Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Total Knee system. The new robotic system combined Mako technology with Stryker’s Triathlon Implant system for total knee replacement. Since receiving FDA approval in 2013, two of the components in the Triathlon Tritanium knee system have been 3D printed.

Styker’s New Knee Replacements
Stryker is combining robotics and 3D printing to create and implant knee replacements.

In 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted 510(k) approval for Stryker’s Tritanium PL (Posterior Lumbar) Cage. The spinal implant is manufactured with the company’s Tritanium In-Growth Technology, which uses 3D printing to create implants that mimic the porous nature of bones. This allows the implant to function in much the same way as natural bone as bone tissue grows around it.
Stryker has developed a proprietary 3D printing process called AMagine — the “AM” stands for “additive manufacturing,” the industry’s name for 3D printing. Working from a computer model of the part, a laser melts and creates layers of titanium powder, welding layer-upon-layer as it builds the finished component.
The customized implants can be based on a patient’s individual anatomy and needs. In 2016, the company was building a new “Center for Excellence” in Cork, Ireland that would include a 3D printing and manufacturing facility.
In May 2016, Stryker’s senior director for platform technology said the company was considering working with hospital chains to develop small 3D printers that could quickly produce custom implants on site.
Speaking at a convention and trade show for the aerospace, defense and medical device industries, Gene Kulesha said the innovation could be less than a decade away.
He outlined the idea of small 3D printers, each with its own team of “print engineers.” The engineers would gather data on a patient’s unique requirements, design custom implants and deliver them for surgery within six hours.

Big Pharma & Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma and Medical Device ManufacturersBig Pharma is the nickname given to the world's vast and influential pharmaceutical industry and its trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA. Big Pharma and medical device companies make billions of dollars every year selling drugs and devices — including those that were recalled or involved in fraud or product liability lawsuits.Jump To TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryJump To TopicSelect TopicAbout Big PharmaBig Pharma’s InfluenceBig Pharma Sways OpinionsInfluencing Doctors & ResearchersFraud SettlementsManufacturer DirectoryThe pharmaceutical industry — nicknamed Big Pharma — is one of the most powerful industries in the world. The global revenue for pharmaceuticals was over $1 trillion in 2014. But nowhere else in the world do the drug and medical device industries have as much power and make as much money as in the U.S.
In fact, Americans spent an all-time high of $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015. By 2020, it will be $610 billion. Medical devices are also lucrative. The U.S. makes up about half of the world’s share of the market at about $148 billion, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.

US based big pharma companies
Meanwhile, drug prices continue to rise. Consulting firm Segal Consulting expects drug prices for Americans under age 65 to rise 11.6 percent in 2017. In contrast, wages are only expected to rise 2.5 percent, leaving many American unable to afford their medications.
Big Pharma even contributes heavily to the annual budget of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through application fees (user fees) for its new products. Experts say the industry contributes about two thirds of the FDA’s budget.
Five of the top 10 pharma and medical device companies for 2016 are headquartered in the U.S.: Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck, Gilead and AbbVie.
The underside of the industry reveals a history of fraud, bribery, product liability lawsuits and scandals that led to billions in settlements — a known cost of doing business for these companies who are “too big to jail.” Despite criminal charges and fines, the companies continue to do business.
Who is Big Pharma?
The majority of drugs and medical devices have ties to a small group of parent companies. Prescription drugs and devices manufactured by these companies bring in billions in profits. The biggest drug makers may also have subsidiaries that manufacture medical devices.
Pharmaceutical companies are typically larger and make more money than companies that focus on medical devices.


The most powerful drug and device companies are members of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) — the industry’s U.S. lobbying organization.

With the help of staggering profits and an army of 1,378 paid lobbyists, the industry spreads its influence on Capitol Hill. From 1998 to 2016, Big Pharma spent nearly $3.5 billion on lobbying expenses — more than any other industry. In 2016 alone, it spent about $246 million — more than the defense industries and corporate business lobbyists combined.

Fact
Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma.

Only 28 percent of Americans have a good opinion of Big Pharma. In fact, they are the second most hated industry in the U.S. They are also the biggest defrauder of the Federal Government under the False Claims Act, according to consumer watchdog group Public Citizen.
The Reputation Institute evaluated public perception of 17 pharmaceutical companies for products and services, innovation, workplace, governance, citizenship and financial performance. The Institute based its results on 16,800 ratings from the U.S., U.K., Canada and other countries.
Of all the countries, the U.S. had the lowest opinion of pharmaceutical companies. Older people had the most favorable view of the industry.

Medical Device Manufacturers
Medical devices can be anything from hospital diagnostic equipment to hip and knee implants. Several companies only produce medical devices, but some drug manufacturers, such as Johnson & Johnson, also manufacture devices.

Fact
Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).

Like Big Pharma, medical device manufacturers also have a lobbying group to pursue their interests in Washington.Part of the total pharmaceutical industry lobbying price tag comes from the Medical Device Manufacturers Association (MDMA).
In 2016, it contributed $1.2 million in lobbying funds. Its efforts concentrate on medical device friendly bills in Congress mostly related to how companies pay taxes.

Big Pharma’s Influence
Critics contend that Big Pharma uses manipulative tactics and expensive advertising to sway lawmakers, the FDA and the public to increase sales.
The public is exposed to Pharma’s misleading promotions and advertising. For example, critics say AbbVie and other companies who make testosterone replacement drugs such as AndroGel marketed their drugs as the fountain of youth to older men. They created a marketing campaign around the condition “Low T” that featured a quiz for men to self-diagnose Low T symptoms.

Androgel, above, was marketed as the “fountain of youth” with few studies to back it up
The testosterone market soared into the billions as a result. But few studies back up drug-company claims that the drug significantly enhances mood, vitality and sexual performance. Studies also link these drugs to heart problems. The FDA added a warning on the label after millions of men were already exposed to the risk.
The American public is not the only sector of society influenced by Big Pharma’s techniques. Doctors, scientists and research organizations, medical journals, teaching hospitals and university medical schools all exhibit disturbing conflicts of interest between their publicly stated missions and their financial and ideological subjection to Big Pharma.
Doctors conduct research with funds from Big Pharma. Private charities and foundations account for a mere 5 percent of the estimated $100 billion spent on biomedical research in the U.S. each year. Pharmaceutical and medical device companies contribute approximately 60 percent.
Big Pharma has a track record of hiring former government workers with valuable connections to gain political clout.

 The trade group PhRMA has many current or former staff members who once served in the political arena, including:

36 who worked for a member of Congress
13 who worked for a federal agency
12 who worked for a congressional committee
Two who worked for the White House
One who worked in the court system


Using these connections to pursue industry goals, Big Pharma has a significant competitive advantage over the public interest.
Marketing, Research and Development (R&D) and Drug Cost
Americans pay more than any other country in the world for pharmaceuticals — in some cases, thousands of dollars more per prescription. Big Pharma says this occurs because of the astronomical costs of developing a new drug.

Cost Facts
While companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.

The truth is that U.S. law allows drug companies to set the prices for drugs and protects them from free-market competition. Other countries set a limit on what companies can charge based on the benefit of the drug. The true cost of developing a drug is shrouded in mystery, with many unverifiable figures reported by Big Pharma.
Donald Light, a professor and expert on the pharma business model, said that while companies claim each new drug costs them $1.2 billion, the true cost is more like 60 million.
The industry also avoids talking about how much it spends on marketing, which is almost double what it spends on research.
Big Pharma Sways Opinions
The large amount of cash Big Pharma bestows on government representatives and regulatory bodies is small when compared with the billions it spends each year on direct-to-consumer advertising. The U.S. is one of only two countries in the world whose governments allow prescription drugs to be advertised on TV (the other is New Zealand).


In 2015, Big Pharma spent $5.4 billion on direct-to-consumer ads and fired off about 80 ads an hour, according to Nielsen.

Big Pharma also employs doctors, researchers and institutions.
The industry persuades doctors to allow ghostwriting, paying physicians to attach their names to positive articles about a particular drug with the goal of seeing it published in a reputable medical journal.

Paid copywriters were used in advertising Paxil,
above
Often the commentary is little more than an advertisement penned by a company paid copywriter showcasing a new product. Big Pharma used ghostwriting to promote numerous drugs, including the antidepressant Paxil, the recalled weight loss drug Fen-Phen, the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin, the antidepressant Zoloft and painkiller Vioxx, to name a few.
In addition, even when a medical reviewer writes a comprehensive assessment of a new drug for a medical journal, it is common practice for those supposedly unbiased professionals to be on Big Pharma’s payroll.
These slanted studies appear in medical journals that are widely hailed as collections of unbiased scientific evaluation and separated from the long financial arm of pharmaceutical industry influence. Yet Richard Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, says, “All journals are bought — or at least cleverly used — by the pharmaceutical industry.”

Big Pharma tends to weaken the objectivity of even the most honest health professionals while encouraging them to overprescribe medications. Consider the numbers:

Advertising instead of research: For every $1 spent on “basic research,” Big Pharma spends $19 on promotions and advertising.
Distribution of free drug samples: The U.S. has one pharmaceutical sales representative for every five office-based physicians.
Sponsorship of symposiums and medical conventions: Drug and medical device makers spend lavishly on doctors, including covering meals, travel, seminars and conventions that sometimes look more like vacations.


Many medical journals, including the esteemed Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), actively vie for the attention of Big Pharma advertising dollars, billing themselves as the best way for drug companies to reach their professional readership.
How Big Pharma Influences Doctors and Researchers
Part of Big Pharma’s formula for creating blockbuster drugs is promoting to physicians and providing kickbacks and incentives to prescribe their expensive, brand name drugs.

Fact
In 2012, Big Pharma spent $24 billion on physician advertising, according to Pew Charitable Trusts.

Drug companies also buy doctors meals and pay them for “speaking engagements” in exchange for brand loyalty. One 2016 study in JAMA Internal Medicine found that when drug reps bought doctors just one meal costing less than $20 they were more likely to prescribe a promoted brand name drug.
According to ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs investigation, 1,866 companies paid $6.25 billion to doctors and hospitals from August 2013 to December 2015.

Drug and Device Company Payments to Doctors from Select Companies, August 2013 to December 2015:



Company
PAYMENTS




DePuy (Johnson & Johnson)
$167 million


Stryker Corporation
$153 million


AstraZeneca
$145 million


Pfizer
$128 million


Janssen Pharmaceuticals
$106 million


GlaxoSmithKline
$86.3 million


Boston Scientific
$77 million




Big Pharma and Researchers
Then there are medical researchers, who are hardly immune to Big Pharma’s financial power. Because drug companies sponsor clinical trials that researchers are paid to administer, too often the academics and scientists are hired hands who supply human subjects and collect data according to the instructions of their corporate employers.
Sponsors keep the data, analyze it, write the papers and decide whether and when and where to submit them for publication. Drug companies also stage-manage trials to produce predetermined outcomes that will put their products in the best light.
Medical Schools and Big Pharma
Big Pharma has also infiltrated medical schools. Teachers, department chairs and deans often sit on drug companies’ boards of directors. This influences educational content. Money from Big Pharma supports programs within many medical schools and teaching hospitals, and company reps are given access to young doctors to promote their company’s drugs.


The result is that doctors not only receive biased information but also learn a drug-intensive style of medicine.

Sales reps may influence these doctors to believe that newer, more expensive drugs are always better than old ones.
In most states, doctors must also take accredited education courses, called continuing medical education (CME). The pharmaceutical industry provides a substantial proportion of the billions spent on CME annually and continues to use that support as a marketing tool.
In addition, academic centers are able to receive royalties from Big Pharma on any drug or technology they help to create and patent as a result of research — sometimes underwritten with government funds.
Columbia University, for example, received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companies during the 17-year life of its medical school’s patent on a method for synthesizing certain biological products.
Columbia University received nearly $790 million from licensing agreements with biotech and pharmaceutical companiesBig Pharma Fraud Settlements
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud, according to Public Citizen’s 2013 report Pharmaceutical Industry Settlements: 1991 through 2015.

Fact
In a 24-year period, Big Pharma companies paid 373 settlements totaling $35.7 billion for marketing fraud.

The most common charge involved drug-pricing scams against state Medicaid programs. This meant state taxpayers ended up footing the bill while Big Pharma made billions.
Unlawful promotion of drugs yielded the biggest settlements. But these investigations take many years to complete. By then, drug companies have made hundreds of millions or even several billion, while the U.S. Department of Justice fine is typically only a few million.
This makes it too profitable to stop breaking the law for many companies, according to Michael Bobelian of Forbes Magazine.

Mergers and acquisitions are a large part of the OEM environment in today’s medical device space. Companies are seeking strategic targets to purchase as a rapid method with which to enhance their international footprint, improve product offerings in specific device sectors, or supplement R&D with the procurement of a start-up company that’s developing a cutting-edge technology. It’s become a pervasive element in the strategy of most medtech OEMs. Stryker, however, may have been one of the more active in 2016. Perhaps not in overall dollar figure, but in terms of the number of transactions, they were likely near the top of the list. And looking at the company’s revenues for the 2016 fiscal year, it seems to be a profitable success.

Overall, Stryker invested more than $4 billion into M&A activities in fiscal 2016. Its two larger purchases were Sage Products and Physio-Control International. In addition, it bought the SafeWire product portfolio, Synergetics USA’s neuro portfolio, Stanmore Implants Worldwide, Ivy Sports Medicine, and BD’s vertebral compression fracture portfolio.

On Feb. 1, Stryker announced it was purchasing Sage Products from Madison Dearborn Partners at a price tag of $2.775 billion. The firm produces disposable products intended to reduce “never events” within the intensive care unit and MedSurg hospital unit setting. The company’s products address issues such as hospital-acquired infections (HAIs), skin injuries, and healthcare worker injury. Sales of these products in 2015 totaled $430 million, which was an increase of 13 percent over the prior year. Undoubtedly, with the shift to value-based care and the efforts toward reducing the instances of such events (particularly HAIs), Stryker views the company as a growth opportunity.

“The company’s established leadership team and innovative products that help prevent hospital-acquired conditions have driven consistent double-digit sales growth,” Kevin A. Lobo, chairman and CEO of Stryker, stated in a release first announcing the transaction. “This acquisition aligns with Stryker’s focus on offering products and services that support a mindset of prevention, specifically in the area of ‘never events’ such as hospital-acquired infections. Today, through our Medical division, Stryker offers products that are complementary to those produced by Sage. Sage has a 45-year history of focus on patients and caregivers that is evident in their culture and fits well with our Medical division. This business will also provide a consistent disposable revenue stream that will complement our capital equipment offerings. We look forward to welcoming the Sage team to Stryker.”

The deal formally closed only a couple months later, on April 1, 2016. Four days later, Stryker noted the completion of its other significant deal in fiscal 2016—the acquisition of Physio-Control International Inc. This transaction—valued at $1.28 billion—was first announced on Feb. 16, 2016. The firm was sold to Stryker by Bain Capital Private Equity in an all-cash transaction. Physio-Control offers more of a emergency medicine type of product line to Stryker, with monitors/defibrillators, automated external defibrillators, and CPR-assist devices making up the bulk of the company’s offerings. It also offers data management and support services. Sales in 2015 totaled $503 million in 2015, which was an increase over the prior year by 6 percent.

Another valuable aspect of Physio-Control was its established presence and infrastructure internationally. “Physio-Control has achieved global leadership positions with a strong brand and customer-centered solutions that can predict or intervene in life-threatening emergencies,” Lobo stated in a release first announcing the transaction.  “Physio-Control’s focused strategy and their culture will fit well within the EMS business of our Medical division, further leveraging our existing call pattern. We look forward to welcoming the Physio-Control team to Stryker.”


ANALYST INSIGHTS: Despite solid performance in recent years, Stryker's biggest challenge will be to successfully sell outside North America. The company sees approximately 70 percent of revenues from the U.S. and Canada while these markets now represent under 50 percent of the total market.

—Tony Freeman, President, AS Freeman Advisors LLC


While these two were the larger transactions for Stryker in 2016, the other deals the OEM made were still significant. Starting in February, it was announced that the neuro portfolio of Synergetics USA was to shift to Stryker in an all-cash deal. This portfolio is comprised of products including the Malis generator, Spetzler Malis disposable forceps, and Stryker’s existing Sonopet tips and RF generator. Sales of approximately $31 million were attributed to the portfolio in 2015.

“The acquisition of the Synergetics neuro portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker Instruments’ Neuro Spine & ENT (NSE) business and is aligned with NSE’s strategy of expanding its neurosurgical product offering,” Timothy J. Scannell, group president of MedSurg and Neurotechnology, stated at the time of the announcement.

Shortly after the Synergetics deal was completed (April 1, 2016), Stryker had another M&A announcement. On April 10, the OEM declared that it was purchasing the SafeWire product portfolio, which had been composed of the Y-Wire guidewire and the Tiger Jamshidi Needle family for use in minimally invasive spine surgery. The products were purchased to enhance Stryker’s spine product portfolio and its focus on minimally invasive spine surgery offerings.

In a release issued announcing the acquisition, Brad Paddock, president of Stryker’s Spine division, said the introduction of the SafeWire portfolio reflects Stryker’s ongoing commitment to patient safety and providing surgeons with innovative technology needed to treat patients undergoing minimally invasive spine surgery. “This acquisition increases our competitive advantage as we broaden our product line and extend our customer base among teaching facilities, competitive accounts, and existing SafeWire customers.”

Another April acquisition was the purchase of BD’s vertebral augmentation solutions business, which included the AVAmax, AVAtex, and AVAprep brands. These minimally invasive products are used in vertebroplasty and vertebral augmentation procedures. They originally came out of the BD acquisition of CareFusion. Similar to several aforementioned transactions, this purchase was accomplished with the intent of bolstering Stryker’s preexisting product line in the space.

“The acquisition of BD’s VCF portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker Instruments’ Interventional Spine (IVS) business and is aligned with IVS’s strategy of expanding its VCF footprint,” Scannell stated at the time of the deal announcement. “It also further strengthens Stryker’s brand in the Neurotechnology space.”

The purchase of Stanmore Implants Worldwide Limited from SIW Holdings Limited for a purchase price of £35.6 million rounded out Stryker’s April buying spree. Stanmore offers custom and off-the-shelf solutions that address the needs of surgeons treating adult and juvenile orthopedic oncology.

Although quiet through the summer months, Stryker kicked off September with its final M&A declaration in fiscal 2016 with the announcement of the acquisition of Ivy Sports Medicine LLC. Ivy Sports Medicine’s product offering was centered around the minimally invasive repair of the meniscus. The portfolio included the only FDA-approved collagen meniscus implant (CMI) and an inside-out meniscal suturing platform.

“The acquisition of Ivy Sports Medicine strengthens our capabilities and fits strategically with our current portfolio. Ivy’s complete meniscal platform, coupled with their clinical history, will allow us to provide our customers with multiple solutions to address meniscal repair,” Matt Moreau, vice president and general manager of Stryker’s Sports Medicine business, said at the time of the announcement. “This is an area of sports medicine where there is continued opportunity to address unmet customer needs. The Ivy portfolio provides a unique platform for us to build upon as we seek to continue advancing the treatment of meniscal injuries.”


ANALYST INSIGHTS: Never a shy company, watch for Stryker to continue its aggressive growth through both acquisition and its international expansion efforts. Stryker is a dangerous competitor as it wakes up “unafraid” to challenge itself each and every day!

—Dave Sheppard, Co-Founder and Principal, MedWorld Advisors


Undoubtedly as a result of the completion of several of these transactions within fiscal 2016, coupled with the success of acquisitions made in earlier years as well as organic sales growth of Stryker’s legacy and newly released products, the OEM enjoyed a significant boost in sales in 2016. For the first time in its history, the company bypassed both the $10 billion and $11 billion sales marks to finish the year at $11.3 billion (an increase of 13.9 percent over the prior year), compared to $9.9 billion in 2015 and $9.7 billion in 2014. Possibly a concern for future growth (or a great opportunity, depending upon how it’s viewed), the company’s sales in fiscal 2016 were primarily driven by the United States, which accounted for 73 percent of total revenue. Across the board, the company’s three main segments—Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine—will need to better penetrate international markets to enjoy even greater growth in the years to come.

The Orthopaedics segment is primarily focused on implants for knee and hip joint replacements, as well as trauma and extremity surgeries. Notable within the segment is the company’s Mako total knee application, which joined the company’s other Mako offerings in the robotic arm-assisted reconstructive surgery line after it received FDA clearance in 2015.

The company celebrated the full launch of the total knee in March 2017. Looking at the segment’s full offering, sales break down fairly evenly among several divisions. Knees were responsible for $1.5 billion in sales, followed by Trauma and Extremities at $1.4 billion. Hips came in at $1.3 billion, with “Other” accounting for $285 million, totaling $4.4 billion for the entire segment. This represented an increase of 4.7 percent over 2015.

MedSurg, which bypassed Orthopaedics in 2016 in terms of percentage of overall contribution to the company’s sales figure for the first time in several years (43 percent for MedSurg versus 39 percent for Orthopaedics), was bolstered by several of the aforementioned acquisitions. The end result was a substantial 25.6 percent increase in sales over 2015. The product offerings from this segment include surgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments); endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy); patient handling, emergency medical equipment, and intensive care disposable products (Medical); and reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices (Sustainability). Similar to the Orthopaedics segment, the sales are spread almost evenly across the divisions, totaling $4.9 billion in sales. Medical led the segment’s sales with more than $1.6 billion, followed by Instruments at just under $1.6 billion. Endoscopy was close behind with $1.5 billion and at a distant fourth for the segment was Sustainability at $238 million.

Neurotechnology and Spine (the name also reflects the only two divisions within the segment) contributed 18 percent to the company’s total sales. The Neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular techniques; a line of products for traditional brain and open skull-based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products; and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. The Spine products include cervical, thoracolumbar, and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity, and degenerative therapies. Sales translated to a 62/38 percent split with Neuro contributing almost $1.3 billion to sales, while Spine was at $754 million. In total, the segment’s $2 billion in sales reflected a 9.9 percent increase over the prior year.

Outside of the product and company acquisitions, Stryker reported organic growth of approximately 6 percent over 2015. While much of that was from already established products the company provided, some of the growth may have originated from several of the new offerings announced in fiscal 2016. In March, the OEM formally introduced two new products at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting—the Aero-C Cervical Stability System and the Xia 4.5 Cortical Trajectory Implants and Instruments. The company claims the Spine division’s Aero-C is the only straight-forward ACDF device that offers uniform compression across the interbody space. The technology received FDA 510(k) clearance in December 2015. Also out of the Spine division, the Xia products are used in less invasive LITe LIF posterior lumbar interbody fusion procedures for patients with degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and trauma. According to the company, it is also intended to be more muscle sparing than standard open procedures that require lateral dissection.

Keeping busy with product launches, the Spine division also debuted a 3D-printed Tritanium posterior lumbar cage at the 2016 American Association of Neurological Surgeons annual meeting. According to Stryker, Tritanium is a novel, highly porous titanium alloy material designed for bone in-growth and biological fixation.

Perhaps addressing the potential challenge associated with the company’s international sales figures, in November 2016, Stryker announced a 20-year partnership with Indo UK Institute of Health’s (IUIH) Medicity Program. Under terms of the agreement, the OEM would serve as a “preferred partner” in the orthopedic areas of hip, knee, and trauma products and services. The deal also includes a sponsorship by Stryker of a post-graduate training education center on the campus of one of IUIH’s medicities and R&D collaboration with Stryker’s Global Technology Center in India.

“The partnership with Stryker is set to redefine the existing paradigms in [the] healthcare industry,” said Ajay Rajan Gupta, managing director and group CEO, IUIH. “With predictable orthopedic spend, improved cash flow, and optimized use of technology resources, the agreement with Stryker will enhance IUIH’s value in healthcare space in years to come.”
