Connect with Michael:








"As the father of two small boys and half of a dual income household, I place a huge priority on knowing that my children are being looked after by wonderful, loving caregivers. Care.com makes that possible for my family and millions of others around the world"




About Michael Echenberg
As Chief Financial Officer of Care.com, the world's largest online marketplace for finding and managing family care, Michael is the Company's lead executive with the financial community including investors, analysts, and banks, and helps evaluate growth opportunities and M&A targets for the Company. In addition, he oversees Care.com's finance function, including accounting, planning, forecasting, tax, treasury, and compliance. Michael joined Care.com in April 2015 from Weight Watchers International Inc. where he served since 2013 as Chief Strategy Officer for the global publicly traded company. In that role, he oversaw all mergers and acquisitions and franchise relationships and drove FP&A and long-range planning initiatives. In 2004, he joined WeightWatchers.com, then a separate company, as its Vice President of Strategy. After helping consummate the transactions that brought WeightWatchers.com and Weight Watchers International together, he held several senior management roles in the combined entity. These included Head of Finance for the North America business unit; CFO of the Weight Watchers Health Solutions business unit in its launch year; and SVP, Corporate Finance & Strategy, which included management of Investor Relations. Michael began his career as a management consultant, first at Dean & Company and then at McKinsey & Company as part of its Corporate Finance & Strategy practice. In between, he served as Head of Strategy for ParentWatch, Inc., a service that enabled parents to view live video streams from their children's child care centers. Michael received his bachelor's degree summa cum laude from Harvard University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, and his MBA with distinction from Harvard Business School.

"Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?"



In the middle of October in 1921, Franz Kafka wrote in his diary, "Life's splendor forever lies in wait about each one of us in all its fullness, but veiled from view, deep down, invisible, far off.  If you summon it by the right word, by its right name, it will come."  I want to seek the splendor, not summon it.  The thrill, I've decided, is in the seeking.  I want to seek it in my relationships with my parents, Judy and Paul, and my sisters, Nancy and Lynne.  What I have with them is always growing, always changing, sometimes challenging, always transcendent.  I want to seek the splendor in love and marriage and children.  My love of children has just become concrete like never before with the arrival of my niece and nephew, Anna and Jake.  I want to seek the splendor in my career.  I want to become expert at something related to building strong, lasting organizations.  And then teach others what I know.  I'll know what that something is before long.  Ultimately, I want to build a strong, lasting organization of my own.  I want to seek the splendor in community involvement, in continuing with my work in environmental education and after-school programs for inner-city kids.  I still can't believe how lucky I am; I want to keep adding to the lives of those less lucky.  And I want to seek the splendor in physical exhilaration playing ultimate frisbee, rollerblading through traffic, and getting lost in the forest.
Ready or not, here I come.
— Michael Echenberg
