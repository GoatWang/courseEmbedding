 Highland Capital Management Announces Launch of Non-Traded Product Line with Affiliate NexPoint Advisors



in Press Releases 
20 Aug 2014 

DALLAS, August 20, 2014 – Highland Capital Management, L.P., (“Highland”), a Dallas-based investment management firm, which together with its affiliates has approximately $19 billion in assets under management, today announced the launch of its non-traded product line with a publicly-registered Business Development Company (BDC) NexPoint Capital, Inc.  The BDC will be the industry’s first healthcare-focused fund of its kind with a target raise of $1.5B in capital for investing primarily in medium-sized businesses.
NexPoint Capital, Inc. represents Highland’s initial non-traded product with the company announcing plans to introduce additional non-traded products later this year. The BDC will be distributed by Highland Capital Funds Distributor, and will be led by Brad Ross, President of Highland Funds, and Brian Mitts, Chief Operating Officer of NexPoint Advisors and head of business development for Highland’s alternative products.
“We believe alternative products offer a compelling, income producing and non-correlated investment option for investors,” said Mr. Mitts. “We’re confident our current suite of liquid alternative mutual funds combined with the non-traded products we’ll be launching over the next few months will offer independent advisors one of the industry’s strongest and most robust product lineups.”
As part of the firm’s expansion into non-traded products, Highland hired Jennifer Ricci as Director of National Accounts in February, and has added eight wholesalers for the wire house channel and five wholesalers for the independent channel to augment its distribution team. The sales team is dedicated to educating investors on alternative products in the independent broker dealer channel. For more information please contact Brian Mitts at BMitts@highlandfunds.com.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

 Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors Expands Independent Broker-Dealer Distribution Channel with Series of New Hires 



in Press Releases 
21 Mar 2016 

Highland Capital Management attracts experienced wholesalers with diverse product offerings for growing independent channel
DALLAS, March 21, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — Highland Capital Management Fund Advisors, L.P., the retail affiliate of Dallas-based investment management firm Highland Capital Management, L.P., is strengthening its commitment to serving the independent broker-dealer (IBD) sales channel with a series of new hires, adding 14 IBD sales professionals in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 alone.
Highland’s IBD sales team represents a broad spectrum of products both from Highland Fund Advisors and from affiliates NexPoint Advisors, L.P., NexPoint Capital, Inc. and NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. Products include non-traded business development companies (BDCs), REITs, mutual funds and ETFs. The firm also expects to roll out a series of interval funds later this year.
“The diverse product offerings we have across the Highland and NexPoint platforms are a significant draw for experienced wholesalers,” said Brad Ross, president of Highland Funds. “The opportunity to represent this broad range of products has been a key factor in attracting top talent and growing our IBD sales team.”
Among that top talent is PJ McDaniel, managing director and head of IBD sales, who joined Highland in October 2015 and has served as a catalyst for the firm’s growth in this area. His background includes more than a decade of experience in the independent channel, which most recently involved building a team of wholesalers at SC Distributors to represent a series of non-traded products.
“We’ve been gaining momentum in the IBD distribution channel that we expect to continue throughout the year,” said McDaniel, who has brought on 10 sales directors and three sales consultants since joining the firm himself. “We’ve already expanded from seven to 15 territories and have several product launches on the horizon that will certainly fuel our growth. And with new hires from the non-traded, liquid alternatives and variable annuity sectors, among others, we continue to build an impressive team with backgrounds as diverse as our product offerings.”
Highland has served the IBD channel since 2013; however, the firm began reinforcing its efforts in the channel last year in response to the expanding role of independents within the advisor network and evidence of that trend intensifying.
The expanded IBD channel presence complements the sizeable, existing presence that Highland has built in the traditional wirehouse channel since 2004.

MUTUAL FUNDSETFsOPEN ENDED FUNDSCLOSED ENDED FUNDSBDCs

Mutual Funds
Highland Capital Management, headquartered in Dallas, TX, is a SEC-registered investment advisor with 17 funds under management. The Firm is one of the most respected and experienced alternative investment managers serving the registered product market. As a manager of managers, we are dedicated to identifying and retaining best in class asset managers to serve as sub-advisers to our funds. One main advantage of open ended mutual funds is that they give investors access to professionally managed, diversified portfolios of equities, bonds and other securities, which would otherwise be difficult to create. Each shareholder participates proportionally in the gain or loss of the fund. Mutual fund units, or shares, are issued and can typically be purchased or redeemed as needed at the fund’s end of day net asset value (NAV) per share.
Each Highland mutual fund portfolio is structured and maintained to match a specific investment objective which is stated in its prospectus. The suite of mutual funds within the Highland complex is designed to represent a comprehensive set of offerings spanning many investment objectives available to construct a diversified investment portfolio. We encourage you to contact an investment professional to assist you in determining which Highland funds are appropriate for your risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Alternative Funds
Alternative investment assets have historically been held by institutional or accredited investors. Highland brings institutional quality strategies and investment managers to the investor in a mutual fund structure. Alternative investments may include long/short, credit oriented products, private equity, technically driven strategies, managed futures, real estate and other hard assets. Read More
Income Funds
Highland’s fixed income funds invest primarily in bonds and other debt instruments. The debt instruments in which the funds invest will depend on their focus. The Highland funds complex includes fixed income strategies that seek to achieve their stated objective by investing in government debt, municipal bonds, investment grade and high yield corporate debt, along with other debt securities including agency, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities. Read More
Equity Funds
Equity mutual funds are principally categorized according to a specific investment objective. Often times equity mutual funds objectives are described by size (small, medium or large cap). The size references the typical capitalization of each underlying investment. Additionally, equity mutual funds can be categorized by style. The style is described as growth, value or geography. Highland offers equity funds of all styles including growth, value, small cap, large cap, international and domestic. Read More
Asset Allocation Funds
Asset allocation mutual funds provide investors with a portfolio of fixed or variable allocations to major asset classes such as stocks, bonds and cash equivalents. Some funds maintain a fixed allocation proportion to specific asset classes while others actively manage the proportional composition of the portfolio in response to macro-economic conditions and/or changes in investment markets. Read More

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

How We Invest
CLO Management

Seeks to achieve better absolute performance with less risk, while providing investors with maximum transparency
Invests in larger, liquid, broadly syndicated bank loans
Utilizes a rigorous credit research process with a low ratio of credits per analyst
Supplements bottom-up analysis with a disciplined approach to risk management and portfolio monitoring

CLO Investing

Seeks to achieve attractive absolute returns while minimizing volatility
Evaluates CLO tranches using a combination of rigorous qualitative (portfolio, manager and legal considerations) and quantitative (structural, cash-flow, collateral valuation and pricing/relative value) analysis
Utilizes a proprietary quantitative analytical tool, CLO ViewPointTM, to view and track Acis credit research team’s credit opinion on each individual loan, including ratings downgrade probability and timing, default probability and estimated recovery values












 

Acis Capital Management, Highland Capital’s Structured Product affiliate, was established as a separate SEC registered investment adviser in 2010 to specialize in Collateralized Loan Obligation (“CLO”) management and CLO investing.
A CLO is an issuance of securities (AAA to B) and an equity tranche backed by the cash flows from a diversified pool of senior secured corporate bank loans. CLOs are structured with a re-investment period, allowing the CLO Manger to actively buy and sell assets, subject to asset quality covenants for a period of 3-5 years. The return paid to the equity holders is the difference between the current yield on the underlying assets and the financing cost of the issued notes.
Highland was one of the early pioneers in the CLO market, setting up one of the first non-bank deals in 1996. Highland together with Acis has become one of the largest managers of US CLOs with over $11B under management including a secondary CLO investment portfolio with over $2 billion of assets under management. Members of the Acis team have structured and managed over $32B of CLOs across 40 vehicles, have invested in over $13 billion of CLO paper and have traded over $17 billion of structured credit paper over the last decade, providing investors optimal access to the market.
The integration of the Acis CLO platform and its rigorous investment and risk management processes focused solely on CLOs provides investors with unique investment opportunities.

Early this year, the issuer filed for 17 alternatives ETFs all targeting four broad hedge funds styles – equity hedge, event driven, macro and relative value. The successful debut of these funds will make Highland one of the largest managers of alternative ETFs in the market.Out of these, Highland Capital recently rolled out a trio of products that aim at giving investors new options in the hedge fund space. The three funds – Highland HFR Global ETF (HHFR), Highland HFR Event Driven ETF (DRVN) and the Highland HFR Equity Hedge ETF (HHDG) – are designed in collaboration with HFR and are the first of their kind to replicate hedge fund positions in an ETF. The trio provides global hedge fund exposure by investing in equity and debt securities of the U.S. and international companies, charging investors 85 bps in annual fees.The introduction of these ETFs quadrupled the size of Highland Capital’s ETF lineup.  HHFR in FocusThis ETF seeks to tracks the HFRL Global Index, which uses all the four hedge fund strategies to select the stocks. These strategies may include event-driven, long/short equity, macro, relative-value and other strategies commonly used by hedge fund managers (see: all the Hedge Fund ETFs here).DRVN in FocusThis fund looks to target the stocks of event-driven strategies, which take advantage of transaction announcements and other specific one-time events. The strategy then utilizes an investment process that identifies equity opportunities in companies which are currently engaged in a corporate transaction, such as mergers, restructurings, financial distress, tender offers, shareholder buybacks, debt exchanges, security issuance or other capital structure adjustments. The ETF seeks to track the HFRL Event-Driven Index.HHDG in FocusThis fund follows the HFRL Equity Hedge Index, which measures the performance of stocks based only on equity hedge strategies that combine long holdings of equity securities with short sales of stock, stock indices or derivatives related to equity markets.How Do They Fit in a Portfolio?The new products appear interesting choices for investors seeking some smart stock-selection techniques to avoid risks in the market (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs to Buy for Summer).Hedge-fund replication ETFs have been gaining immense popularity in recent years as these seek to outperform the market over the long term. The funds try to either replicate the investing styles of renowned investors or mimic an index that aims to provide specific hedge fund strategies. This results in a solid and well-diversified portfolio having superior adjusted risk returns. After all, the hedge funds have proven their supremacy by making huge money in any market environment.CompetitionWhile there are a number of hedge-fund replication ETFs on the market that use a fund-of-fund approach, there are only a few that use a stock-selection methodology. The ultra-popular Global X Top Guru Holdings Index ETF (GURU) uses a proprietary methodology to compile the best ideas from a select pool of hedge funds by looking at the 13F document on a quarterly basis. The ETF has AUM of $266 million and expense ratio of 0.75%.The other popular name in this regard is AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (ALFA), which has garnered $161.6 million in its asset base while charging 95 bps in fees per year. It uses a proprietary ranking system, ‘Clone Score’, which ranks hedge funds and institutional investors based on the efficacy of replicating their publicity disclosed positions (read: Guide to Guru ETF Investing).IQ Merger Arbitrage ETF (MNA) is an event-driven hedge fund that might give stiff competition to DRVN. This fund offers capital appreciation by investing in global companies for which there has been a public announcement of a takeover by an acquirer yet provides short exposure to global equities as a partial equity market hedge. The product has amassed $130 million in its asset base and charges 75 bps in annual fees.Given that all these products have been able to build up decent assets, it might not be difficult for the Highland products to see solid inflows and garner investor interest given that the interest rate hike might lead to uncertainty and bouts of volatility.Read MoreWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
