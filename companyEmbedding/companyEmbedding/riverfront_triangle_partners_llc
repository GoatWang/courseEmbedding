Missoula leaders look to extend Riverfront Triangle development agreement

MISSOULA -
            Missoula leaders are considering whether to extend the agreement with a private development group looking to reconstruct the city's Riverfront Triangle, giving the partners more time to plan for a project which would dramatically change the west side of downtown.The city has been working with the group known as Hotel Fox, LLC since 2011. The partnership includes developers who've been involved in some of the most significant projects in the region over the past decade. That original agreement was extended, and the scope of work expanded, in late 2012 at the suggestion of Mayor John Engen. Engen wanted to see if it would be possible to use the proposed hotel and conference center to leverage a broader redevelopment of the Riverfront Triangle area, which borders downtown to the west off Orange Street and Broadway.Those discussions and studies have involved entities like the Missoula Downtown Association, and Providence Health and Services, the parent organization of St. Patrick Hospital, which owns much of the property in the Triangle.The concepts have grown from the "Hotel Fox" to a broader plan that could incorporate other elements such as offices, commercial and retail space in the past few months.Wednesday, the Missoula Redevelopment Agency will ask the Missoula City Council's Committee of the Whole to endorse a request to extend the development agreement with Hotel Fox, LLC for another 18 months. That would give the partners an additional 18-months to finalize their plans for development, marketing and financing for the multi-million dollar project.

South Bend Developer Planning Riverfront Condos
Posted:

Updated: 

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 2:21 PM EDT




A South Bend-based development group wants to build a luxury condominium development along the St. Joseph River in the city. Wharf Partners LLC says the more than $18 million project is expected to be complete next year. July 17, 2013
News Release
SOUTH BEND, Ind. - Wharf Partners, LLC announces that a new urban lifestyle option - riverfront mid-rise luxury condominiums–is coming to South Bend. Known as The Cascade Condominiums, the location is at the former Wharf Restaurant property on Colfax Avenue at the river. Situated between the river and the East Race Waterway, the prime site overlooks Century Center, the downtown skyline and the rushing waters of the cascades swirling below the St. Joseph River dam. The site is also opposite the "Keepers of the Fire" in-river kinetic sculpture created by world-renowned artist Mark diSuvero.
The Cascade will offer its residents a gracious and sophisticated urban living experience on what is simply the single most dynamic property anywhere in the community. Two 8-story residential towers will provide residents with panoramic views both up-and-down river, across the entire downtown skyline and along the East Race. Some sightlines extend all the way to Notre Dame.
Planned for occupancy in 2014, The Cascade is owned and being developed by Wharf Partners LLC, which acquired the parcel in late 2011 after the previous owner invested more a decade attempting to develop the site for various uses. "We believe that this is the right time and that we have the right product for this magnificent site," states Frank Perri, one of the partners. "A new low-rise housing market has taken hold on the East Bank in recent years which we applaud, but what we're developing now is essentially a downtown Chicago or Indianapolis caliber mid-rise project appropriately scaled to the South Bend market.
The Cascade will bring a long-deserved level of development density and elegance to this key riverfront site, creating a new housing option that is unavailable anywhere else in the marketplace."
Perched above an on-grade enclosed parking level that elevates the condominiums for privacy and views, each floor contains only two units which vary in size from approximately 2,500 to 3,000 sq. ft., and which may be combined into a single 5,500 sq. ft. condominium.
"That's larger than most executive homes in Granger," Perri notes. In addition to the enclosed parking, all condominiums will have card-access entry and elevator service, floor to ceiling window walls with panoramic views, and private balconies facing the river.
Between the towers will be a fully-enclosed landscaped ground-level courtyard; and all occupants will share access to a common 8th level green roof terrace and entertainment penthouse with a wet bar and restroom, decorative rooftop lighting and outdoors eating areas. Second floor units will offer private green roof patios and an optional solarium extension as well. The building's design incorporates green concepts and sustainable design principles managed by LEED-accredited professionals of Panzica Building Corporation, including the influence of Panzica Architect's west coast design studio in Redmond, Washington. While several model plans have been developed, each condominium will be custom planned by registered interior designers to suit the tastes and lifestyle of each individual owner.
According to architect Philip Panzica, the buildings will be constructed of durable and attractive precast concrete, making the structure far stronger, safer, and more durable than wood framing common to low-rise multi-housing. The buildings will also be fully fire-sprinkled and alarmed. Panzica notes that his firm has received two national awards for design excellence in precast concrete, and in addition to featuring large expanses of glass the facades will be textured and stained to have the appearance of brick and cut stone.
"The Cascade's design strikes a deliberate balance between the sleek modernism of the notable structures across the river, including Philip Johnson's Century Center and Helmet Jahn's 1st Source Center/Doubletree, contrasted with the burly 19th century industrial aesthetic of historic Stephenson Mills next door. The Cascade will also transition the scale of downtown central business district to the east side of the river, helping to visually connect the East Bank Village with the heart of the city."
Panzica observes the further importance of having a significant development on the riverfront site to strengthen a link between downtown and revitalized areas around the Notre Dame Campus such as the Notre Dame Avenue corridor, St. Joseph's High School, Eddy Street Commons and the new Triangle Neighborhood. "Most thoroughfares tying Notre Dame to downtown pass through the East Bank Village," says Panzica, "so this site and the riverfront are vital to the new tapestry that’s being woven between Notre Dame and South Bend's urban core."
The Phase I south tower adjacent to Seitz Park will include up to twelve condominiums, for which pre-reservations are being accepted for anticipated 2014 occupancy. A Phase II companion tower along Colfax will follow pending the pace of presales. A mixed-use structure along Colfax may be developed based on market conditions.
