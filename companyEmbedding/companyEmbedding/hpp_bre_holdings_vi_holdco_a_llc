	Common Stock




	 



	 




	We are offering 8,881,575 shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, and the selling stockholders named in this prospectus
	supplement are offering 9,792,233 shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering.




	We intend to use the net proceeds received by us in this offering to acquire an aggregate of 8,881,575 common units of partnership
	interest, or common units, in Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. from certain entities affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. and from certain funds affiliated with Farallon Capital Management, L.L.C., which we refer to collectively as the selling
	unitholders. We refer to our acquisition of such common units as the unit repurchase.




	We are organized and conduct our
	operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for federal income tax purposes. To assist us in complying with certain federal income tax requirements applicable to REITs, our charter contains certain restrictions relating to the
	ownership and transfer of our stock, including an ownership limit of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer in the accompanying prospectus.




	Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE, under the symbol HPP. The last reported sale price of
	our common stock on the NYSE on January 4, 2017 was $35.37 per share.



	 



	 





	See 

	Risk Factors

	 beginning on

	page S-4

	of this prospectus supplement and the risks set forth under the caption Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our most recent Annual Report on

	Form 10-K,

	which is incorporated by reference herein, for certain risks relevant to an investment in our common stock.





	The underwriters have agreed to purchase the shares of common stock from us and the selling stockholders at a price of $35.00 per share, which will result in approximately $310.9 million and
	$342.7 million of net proceeds to us and the selling stockholders, respectively, before expenses. The shares may be offered by the underwriters from time to time to purchasers directly or through agents, or through brokers in brokerage
	transactions on the NYSE, or to dealers in negotiated transactions or in a combination of such methods of sale, at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to such
	prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. See Underwriting.





	Neither the Securities and Exchange
	Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these securities or determined if this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus are truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal
	offense.





	The common stock sold in this offering will be ready for delivery in book-entry form through The Depository Trust
	Company on or about January 10, 2017.

	FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION





	This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the documents that we incorporate by reference in each contain
	forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Also, documents we subsequently file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and incorporate by reference will contain forward-looking statements.




	In particular, statements pertaining to our liquidity and capital resources, portfolio performance and results of operations contain
	forward-looking statements. Furthermore, all of the statements regarding future financial performance (including anticipated funds from operations, market conditions and demographics) are forward-looking statements. We are including this cautionary
	statement to make applicable and take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 for any such forward-looking statements. We caution investors that any forward-looking statements presented in this
	prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and the documents that we incorporate by reference in each, are based on managements beliefs and assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. You can identify
	forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology such as anticipate, believe, expect, intend, may, might, plan, estimate,
	project, should, will, result and similar expressions or the negative of such words or expressions that are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and that do not relate solely to
	historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.




	Forward
	looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks, trends, uncertainties or factors
	materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We do not guarantee that the transactions and events described will happen as described (or that they
	will happen at all).




	Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, liquidity or
	achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:

	While forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs, they are not guarantees of future performance. We expressly disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
	statement to reflect changes in underlying assumptions or factors, or new information, data or methods, future events or other changes. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which were based on
	results and trends at the time they were made, to anticipate future results or trends. For a further discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future results, performance or transactions, see the section of this prospectus
	supplement entitled Risk Factors, including the risks incorporated therein from the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended,

	PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT SUMMARY






	This summary highlights information contained elsewhere or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying
	prospectus. This summary is not complete and does not contain all of the information that you should consider before investing in our common stock. We urge you to read this entire prospectus supplement, the accompanying prospectus and the documents
	incorporated by reference carefully, including the financial statements and notes to those financial statements incorporated by reference herein and therein. Please read Risk Factors for more information about important risks that you
	should consider before investing in our common stock.






	Our Company





	We are a full-service, vertically integrated real estate company focused on owning, operating and acquiring high-quality office
	properties and state-of-the-art media and entertainment properties in select growth markets primarily in Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Our investment strategy focuses on high barrier-to-entry, in-fill locations with
	favorable, long-term supply demand characteristics in select markets, including Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego, San Francisco, Silicon Valley and Seattle.




	As of January 4, 2017, our portfolio included office properties, comprising an aggregate of approximately 13.8 million square feet, and media and entertainment properties, comprising
	approximately 0.9 million square feet of sound-stage, office and supporting production facilities. We also own undeveloped density rights for approximately 2.6 million square feet of future office space.




	We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We
	believe that we have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner. We conduct substantially all of our business
	through our operating partnership, of which we serve as the sole general partner.





	Recent Developments





	On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of a leasehold interest in Page Mill Hill, a five-building office campus totaling
	182,676 square feet in Palo Alto, California for $150 million (before credits, prorations and closing costs) from a joint venture owned by Lionstone Investments and CalSTRS. Page Mill Hill is currently substantially fully leased to prominent legal
	and accounting firms, including Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher; Frank, Rimerman + Co.; Manatt, Phelps & Phillips; and Perkins Coie. The acquisition was financed through drawings on our unsecured revolving credit facility.




	As of January 3, 2017, the outstanding balance under our unsecured revolving credit facility was $300.0 million.





	Corporate Information





	Our principal executive offices are located at 11601 Wilshire Boulevard, Ninth Floor, Los Angeles, California 90025. Our telephone number is 310-445-5700. Our Web site address is

	Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2015, as amended;

	the general reputation of REITs and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued

	




	 





	our underlying asset value;






	 





	 




	

	S-4







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	failure to meet earnings estimates;






	 





	 




	

	our issuance of debt or preferred equity securities; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.







	In the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price
	of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flow and per share
	trading price of our common stock.






	Market interest rates may have an effect on the value of our common stock.






	One of the factors that will influence the per share trading price of our common stock will be the dividend yield on our common stock (as
	a percentage of the price of our common stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of shares of our common stock to
	expect a higher dividend yield and higher interest rates would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the per share trading price of our common
	stock to decrease.






	The number of shares of our common stock available for future issuance or sale could adversely affect the per share
	trading price of our common stock.






	We cannot predict whether future issuances or sales of shares of our common stock
	or the availability of shares of our common stock for resale in the open market will decrease the per share trading price of our common stock. The issuance of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock in the public market, or upon exchange
	of common units, or the perception that such issuances might occur, could adversely affect the per share trading price of our common stock.




	The exchange of common units for common stock, the exercise of any options or the vesting of any restricted stock granted to certain directors, executive officers and other employees under our equity
	incentive plan, or the issuance of our common stock or common units in connection with future property, portfolio or business acquisitions could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of our common stock. In addition, the existence of
	common units, options, shares of our common stock reserved for issuance as restricted shares of our common stock or upon exchange of common units may adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale
	of equity securities. Future issuances of shares of our common stock may also be dilutive to existing stockholders.






	Future offerings of
	debt securities, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the per share
	trading price of our common stock.






	In the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources by making
	additional offerings of debt or equity securities (or causing our operating partnership to issue debt or equity securities), including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and additional classes or series of preferred stock or preferred
	units. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock or preferred units of partnership interest in our operating partnership and lenders with respect to other borrowings would be entitled to receive our available
	assets prior to distribution to the holders of our common stock. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may
	result in dilution to owners of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not




	 




	S-5







	Table of Contents




	entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Any shares of preferred stock we issue or preferred units our operating partnership issues in the future could have a
	preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit our ability pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market
	conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of any such future offering. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the per share trading price of our common
	stock and diluting their interest in us.






	Our ability to pay dividends is limited by the requirements of Maryland law.






	Our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is limited by the laws of Maryland. Under applicable Maryland law, a
	Maryland corporation generally may not make a distribution if, after giving effect to the distribution, the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the usual course of business or the corporations total assets
	would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the corporations charter permits otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights
	upon dissolution of stockholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. Accordingly, we generally may not make a distribution on our common stock if, after giving effect to the distribution, we would not be able
	to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus, unless the terms of such class or series provide otherwise, the amount that would be needed to satisfy
	the preferential rights upon dissolution of the holders of shares of any class or series of preferred stock then outstanding, if any, with preferences upon dissolution senior to those of our common stock.

	USE OF PROCEEDS





	We expect the net proceeds to us from the sale of common stock by us in this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts,
	will be approximately $310.9 million.




	We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting
	discounts, but before estimated offering expenses payable by us, to acquire an aggregate of 8,881,575 common units from the selling unitholders in the unit repurchase, consisting of 8,598,480 common units to be acquired from Blackstone and 283,095
	common units to be acquired from the Farallon Funds.




	We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of
	our common stock by the selling stockholders, but, pursuant to registration rights agreements, we will pay (i) all of the expenses of this offering with respect to the shares of common stock sold by Blackstone, other than underwriting fees,
	discounts and commissions, which will be borne by Blackstone, and (ii) approximately half of the expenses of this offering with respect to the shares of common stock sold by the Farallon Funds, other than underwriting discounts, which will be
	borne by the Farallon Funds.




	The estimated offering expenses payable by us from the sale of common stock by us and the
	selling stockholders, exclusive of underwriting discounts, are approximately $250,000.

	Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the underwriting agreement, the underwriters have agreed
	to purchase all of the shares of common stock sold under the underwriting agreement if any of these shares are purchased. If an underwriter defaults, the underwriting agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the nondefaulting underwriters
	may be increased or the underwriting agreement may be terminated.




	We, our operating partnership and the selling stockholders

	The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock, subject to prior sale, when, as and if issued to and accepted by them, subject

	The underwriters are purchasing the shares of common stock from us and the selling stockholders at a price of $35.00 per share. The underwriters propose to offer the shares of common stock for sale
	from time to time in one or more transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market, through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated
	prices, subject to receipt of acceptance by it and subject to its right to reject any order in whole or in part. The underwriters may effect such transactions by selling the shares of common stock to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive
	compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or commissions from the underwriters and/or purchasers of shares of common stock for whom they may act as agents or to whom they may sell as principal. The difference between the price at which the
	underwriters purchase shares of common stock and the price at which the underwriters resell such shares of common stock may be deemed underwriting compensation.




	We estimate that our portion of the total expenses of this offering, excluding underwriting discounts, will be $250,000.






	No Sales of Similar Securities






	Pursuant to the underwriting
	agreement, we and the selling stockholders have agreed, subject to specified exemptions, not to sell or transfer any shares of common stock or any securities convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock (including units in our
	operating partnership), for 30 days after the date of this

	ownership of the common stock, whether any such swap or transaction is to be settled by delivery of common stock or other securities, in cash or otherwise.







	The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to: (A) with respect to us, (1) any shares of our common stock issued or options to purchase our common stock
	granted pursuant to the Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 2010 Incentive Award Plan, as amended, or the Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. Director Stock Plan, (2) any shares of our common stock issued pursuant to
	any non-employee director stock plan or dividend reinvestment plan referred to in this prospectus supplement (including the documents incorporated herein by reference), (3) shares of our common stock transferred in accordance with Article VI of
	our charter, (4) shares of our common stock, in the aggregate not to exceed 10% of the number of shares of common stock outstanding, issued in connection with other acquisitions of real property or real property companies, provided, in the case
	of this clause (4), that each acquirer agrees to similar restrictions, and (5) the filing of a registration statement on Form S-8 relating to the offering of securities in accordance with the terms of an equity incentive plan; and (B) with
	respect to the selling stockholders, (1) their sale of our shares to the underwriters and (2) their sale, as selling unitholders, of common units to us in the unit repurchase. In the case of the selling stockholders, the restrictions
	described in the immediately preceding paragraph are subject to the exemptions specified in their respective lock-up agreements.




	This lock-up provision applies to common stock and to securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for common stock. It also applies to common stock owned now or acquired later by the person
	executing the agreement or for which the person executing the agreement later acquires the power of disposition.






	New York Stock
	Exchange Listing






	The shares are listed on the NYSE under the symbol HPP.






	Short Positions






	In connection with this offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell our common stock in the open market. These transactions may
	include short sales and purchases on the open market to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in this offering. Covered
	short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters option to purchase additional shares. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or
	purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the
	price at which they may purchase shares through the option granted to them. Naked short sales are sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A short
	position is




	 




	S-13







	Table of Contents




	more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of our common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect
	investors who purchase in this offering.




	Similar to other purchase transactions, the underwriters purchases to cover
	short sales may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our common stock or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that
	might otherwise exist in the open market. The underwriters may conduct these transactions on the NYSE, in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.




	Neither we, nor the selling stockholders nor the underwriters make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the
	price of our common stock. In addition, neither we, nor the selling stockholders nor the underwriters make any representation that the underwriters will engage in these transactions or that these transactions, once commenced, will not be
	discontinued without notice.






	Electronic Distribution






	In connection with this offering, the underwriters may distribute this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus by electronic means, such as e-mail.






	Relationships






	The underwriters and their affiliates have engaged in, and may in the future engage in, investment banking and other commercial dealings
	in the ordinary course of business with us and/or our affiliates. They have received, or may in the future receive, customary fees and commissions for these transactions.




	In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or
	related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our
	affiliates.




	Affiliates of the underwriters have lending relationships with us and may routinely hedge their credit exposure
	to us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our
	securities. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they
	acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.

	ABOUT THIS PROSPECTUS





	This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the Securities and
	Exchange Commission, as a well-known seasoned issuer as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, using a shelf registration process. By using a shelf registration statement, we may sell securities
	(including guarantees of debt securities sold by our operating partnership) from time to time and in one or more offerings and the selling securityholders to be named in a supplement to this prospectus may, from time to time, sell common stock from
	time to time in one or more offerings as described in this prospectus. Each time that we or the selling securityholders offer and sell securities, we or the selling securityholders will provide a prospectus supplement to this prospectus that
	contains specific information about the securities being offered and sold and the specific terms of that offering. The prospectus supplement may also add, update or change information contained in this prospectus with respect to that offering. If
	there is any inconsistency between the information in this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement, you should rely on the prospectus supplement. Before purchasing any securities, you should carefully read both this prospectus and the
	applicable prospectus supplement, together with the additional information described under the heading Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference.




	Neither we, nor the selling securityholders, have authorized any other person to provide you with different information. If anyone
	provides you with different or inconsistent information, you should not rely on it. We and the selling securityholders will not make an offer to sell these securities in any jurisdiction where the offer or sale is not permitted. You should assume
	that the information appearing in this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement to this prospectus is accurate as of the date on its respective cover, and that any information incorporated by reference is accurate only as of the date of
	the document incorporated by reference, unless we indicate otherwise. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since those dates.




	References to the Company or the guarantor refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation.
	References to our operating partnership or the operating partnership refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership. When we refer to we, our, us and our
	company, we mean the Company, our operating partnership and any of our other subsidiaries, unless otherwise specified. When we refer to you, we mean the holders of the applicable series of securities.

	The Companys ratios of earnings to fixed charges are computed by dividing earnings by fixed
	charges. The Companys ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred dividends are computed by dividing earnings by the sum of fixed charges and preferred dividends. For these purposes, earnings consist of net income
	(loss) plus fixed charges. Net income (loss) is computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and includes such non-cash items as real estate depreciation and amortization, amortization of above (below) market
	rents, and amortization of deferred financing costs and loan premium. Net loss in 2010 also includes one-time transactional costs relating to the Companys initial public offering and related formation transactions and acquisitions subsequent
	to our initial public offering. Fixed charges consist of interest expense, capitalized interest and amortization of deferred financing fees and loan premium, whether expensed or capitalized, interest within rental expense and preference
	security dividend requirements of consolidated subsidiaries. Interest income is not included in this computation. Preferred dividends consist of the amount of pre-tax earnings required to make distributions on our operating
	partnerships series A preferred units and pay dividends on our series B preferred stock.

	DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES AND RELATED GUARANTEES





	The following description, together with the additional information we include in any applicable prospectus supplement,
	summarizes certain general terms and provisions of the debt securities and related guarantees, if any, that we may offer under this prospectus. When our operating partnership offers to sell a particular series of debt securities, we will describe
	the specific terms of the series in a supplement to this prospectus, including the terms of any related guarantees. We will also indicate in the prospectus supplement to what extent the general terms and provisions described in this prospectus apply
	to a particular series of debt securities. To the extent the information contained in the prospectus supplement differs from this summary description, you should rely on the information in the prospectus supplement.




	Debt securities may be our operating partnerships senior, senior subordinated or subordinated obligations and, unless otherwise
	specified in a supplement to this prospectus, the debt securities will be the direct, unsecured obligations of our operating partnership and may be issued in one or more series.




	The debt securities will be issued under an indenture among our operating partnership, as issuer, the Company, as guarantor, and a
	trustee. We have summarized select portions of the indenture below. The summary is not complete. The form of the indenture has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement and you should read the indenture and debt securities carefully for
	provisions that may be important to you. Capitalized terms used in the summary and not defined in this prospectus have the meanings specified in the indenture.





	General





	The terms of each series of debt securities will be established by
	the Company, as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, by or pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors of the Company and set forth or determined in the manner provided in such resolutions, in an officers certificate
	or by a supplemental indenture. The particular terms of each series of debt securities will be described in a prospectus supplement relating to such series, including any pricing supplement or term sheet.




	Unless otherwise specified in a supplement to this prospectus, the debt securities will be the direct, unsecured obligations of our
	operating partnership and may be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Company. Our operating partnership can issue an unlimited amount of debt securities under the indenture that may be in one or more series with the same or various
	maturities, at par, at a premium, or at a discount. We will set forth in a prospectus supplement, including any pricing supplement or term sheet, relating to any series of debt securities being offered, the aggregate principal amount and the

	Transfer and Exchange





	Each debt security will be represented by either one or more global securities registered in the name of The Depository Trust Company, or the Depositary or DTC, or a nominee of the Depositary (we will

	governmental charge payable in connection with a transfer or exchange.




	You may effect the transfer of certificated debt
	securities and the right to receive the principal of, and any premium and interest on, certificated debt securities only by surrendering the certificate representing those certificated debt securities and either reissuance by us or the trustee of

	Global Debt

	No Protection in the Event of a Change of Control





	Unless we state otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement, the debt securities will not contain any provisions that may afford holders of the debt securities protection in the event we have a
	change in control or in the event of a highly leveraged transaction (whether or not such transaction results in a change in control) that could adversely affect holders of debt securities.





	Covenants





	We will set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement any
	restrictive covenants applicable to any issue of debt securities.

	Our operating partnership may not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of our
	operating partnerships properties and assets to, any person, which we refer to as a successor person, unless:

	certain other conditions are met.







	Notwithstanding the above, any of our operating partnerships subsidiaries may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties to it.





	Events of Default





	Default means any event which is, or after notice or passage of time or both would be, an Event of Default,




	Event of Default means, with respect to any series of debt securities, any of the following:



	 





	 




	




	 





	default in the payment of any interest upon any debt security of that series when it becomes due and payable, and continuance of that default for a
	period of 30 days (unless the entire amount of the payment is deposited by us with the trustee or with a paying agent prior to the expiration of the 30-day period),






	 





	 




	




	 





	default in the payment of principal of any debt security of that series at its maturity,






	 





	 




	




	 





	default in the performance or breach of any other covenant or warranty by our operating partnership in the indenture (other than a covenant or warranty
	that has been included in the indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series), which default continues uncured for a period of 60 days after we receive written notice from the trustee or we and the trustee
	receive written notice from the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series as provided in the indenture,






	 





	 




	




	 





	certain voluntary or involuntary events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of our operating partnership, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series that is described in the applicable prospectus supplement.







	No Event of Default with respect to a particular series of debt securities (except as to certain events of
	bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) necessarily constitutes an Event of Default with respect to any other series of debt securities. The occurrence of certain Events of Default or an acceleration under the indenture may constitute an event of
	default under certain of our or our subsidiaries indebtedness outstanding from time to time.




	If an Event of Default
	with respect to outstanding debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing, then the trustee or the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series may, by a notice in writing to us
	(and to the trustee if given by the holders), declare to be due and payable immediately the principal (or, if the debt securities of that series are discount securities, that portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that
	series) of, and any accrued and unpaid interest on, all debt securities of that series. In the case of an Event of Default resulting from certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal (or such specified amount) of, and
	any accrued and unpaid interest on, all outstanding debt securities will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the trustee or any holder of outstanding debt securities. At any time after a
	declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for payment of the money due has been obtained by the trustee, the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
	debt securities of that series may rescind and annul the acceleration if all Events of Default, other




	 




	11







	Table of Contents




	than the non-payment of accelerated principal and interest, if any, with respect to debt securities of that series, have been cured or waived as provided in the indenture. We refer you to the
	prospectus supplement relating to any series of debt securities that are discount securities for the particular provisions relating to acceleration of a portion of the principal amount of such discount securities upon the occurrence of an Event of
	Default.




	The indenture provides that the trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of its rights or powers under
	the indenture unless the trustee receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any cost, liability or expense that might be incurred by it in exercising such right or power. Subject to certain rights of the trustee, the holders of a majority in
	principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series will have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee
	with respect to the debt securities of that series.




	No holder of any debt security of any series will have any right to
	institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to the indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any remedy under the indenture, unless:



	 





	 




	




	 





	that holder has previously given to the trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to debt securities of that series, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series have made written request, and offered
	reasonable indemnity or security, to the trustee to institute the proceeding as trustee, and the trustee has not received from the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of that series a direction
	inconsistent with that request and has failed to institute the proceeding within 60 days.







	Notwithstanding
	any other provision in the indenture, the holder of any debt security will have an absolute and unconditional right to receive payment of the principal of, and any premium and interest on, that debt security on or after the due dates expressed in
	that debt security and to institute suit for the enforcement of payment.




	The indenture requires us, within 120 days after the
	end of our fiscal year, to furnish to the trustee a statement as to compliance with the indenture. If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing with respect to the debt securities of any series and if it is known to a responsible
	officer of the trustee, the trustee shall mail to each holder of the debt securities of that series notice of a Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. The indenture provides that the trustee may withhold notice to the
	holders of debt securities of any series of any Default or Event of Default (except in payment on any debt securities of that series) with respect to debt securities of that series if the trustee determines in good faith that withholding notice is
	in the interest of the holders of those debt securities.





	Modification and Waiver





	We and the trustee may modify and amend the indenture or the debt securities of any series without the consent of any holder of any debt
	security:



	 





	 




	




	 





	to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to comply with covenants in the indenture described above under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to provide for uncertificated securities in addition to or in place of certificated securities,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to surrender any of our rights or powers under the indenture,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to add covenants or events of default for the benefit of the holders of debt securities of any series,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to comply with the applicable procedures of the applicable depositary,







	 




	12







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	to make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any holder of debt securities,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to provide for the issuance of and establish the form and terms and conditions of debt securities of any series as permitted by the indenture,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to effect the appointment of a successor trustee with respect to the debt securities of any series and to add to or change any of the provisions of the
	indenture to provide for or facilitate administration by more than one trustee,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to comply with requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the indenture under the Trust
	Indenture Act,






	 





	 




	




	 





	to reflect the release of a guarantor of the debt securities in accordance with the terms of the indenture, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	to add guarantors with respect to any or all of the debt securities or to secure any or all of the debt securities or the guarantees.







	We may also modify and amend the indenture with the consent of the holders of at least a majority in
	principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of each series affected by the modifications or amendments. We may not make any modification or amendment without the consent of the holders of each affected debt security then outstanding if that
	amendment will:



	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the amount of debt securities whose holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver,






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any debt security,






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the principal of or premium on, or change the fixed maturity of, any debt security, or reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the
	payment of any sinking fund or analogous obligation with respect to any series of debt securities,






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce the principal amount of discount securities payable upon acceleration of maturity,






	 





	 




	




	 





	waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any debt security (except a rescission of
	acceleration of the debt securities of any series by the holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding debt securities of that series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration),






	 





	 




	




	 





	make the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any debt security payable in any currency other than that stated in the debt security,






	 





	 




	




	 





	make any change to certain provisions of the indenture relating to, among other things, the right of holders of debt securities to receive payment of
	the principal of, or any premium and interest on, those debt securities and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment and to waivers or amendments,






	 





	 




	




	 





	waive a redemption payment with respect to any debt security, or






	 





	 




	




	 





	if the debt securities of that series are entitled to the benefit of a guarantee, release any guarantor of such series other than as provided in the
	indenture or modify the guarantee in any manner adverse to the holders.







	Except for certain specified
	provisions, the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all debt securities of that series waive our compliance with provisions of the indenture. The holders
	of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series may on behalf of the holders of all of the debt securities of such series waive any past default under the indenture with respect to that series and its consequences,
	except a default in the payment




	 




	13







	Table of Contents




	of the principal of, or any premium or interest on, any debt security of that series; 

	provided, however,

	 that the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding
	debt securities of any series may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted from the acceleration.





	Defeasance of Debt Securities and Certain Covenants in Certain Circumstances






	Legal Defeasance.

	 The indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series of debt
	securities, we may be discharged from any and all obligations in respect of the debt securities of any series (subject to certain exceptions). We will be so discharged upon the deposit with the trustee, in trust, of money and/or U.S. government
	obligations or, in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than U.S. dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal
	in accordance with their terms, will provide money or U.S. government obligations in an amount sufficient in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of
	principal of, any premium and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of, the debt securities of that series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities.




	This discharge may occur only if, among other things, we have delivered to the trustee an opinion of counsel stating that we
	have received from, or there has been published by, the United States Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, a ruling or, since the date of execution of the indenture, there has been a change in the applicable United States federal income tax law, in
	either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall confirm that, the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit,
	defeasance and discharge and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if the deposit, defeasance and discharge had not occurred.





	Defeasance of Certain Covenants

	. The indenture provides that, unless otherwise provided by the terms of the applicable series
	of debt securities, upon compliance with certain conditions:



	 





	 




	




	 





	we may omit to comply with the covenant described under the heading Consolidation, Merger and Sale of Assets and certain other covenants
	set forth in the indenture, as well as any additional covenants that may be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any omission to comply with those covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series, or
	covenant defeasance.







	The conditions include:



	 





	 




	




	 





	depositing with the trustee money and/or U.S. government obligations or, in the case of debt securities denominated in a single currency other than
	U.S. dollars, government obligations of the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency, that, through the payment of interest and principal in accordance with their terms, will provide money in an amount sufficient in the opinion of
	a nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants or investment bank to pay and discharge each installment of principal of, any premium and interest on, and any mandatory sinking fund payments in respect of the debt securities of that
	series on the stated maturity of those payments in accordance with the terms of the indenture and those debt securities, and






	 





	 




	




	 





	delivering to the trustee an opinion of counsel to the effect that the holders of the debt securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or
	loss for United States federal income tax purposes as a result of the deposit and related covenant defeasance and will be subject to United States federal income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
	the case if the deposit and related covenant defeasance had not occurred.







	 




	14







	Table of Contents





	Covenant Defeasance and Events of Default

	. In the event we exercise our option to
	effect covenant defeasance with respect to any series of debt securities and the debt securities of that series are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any Event of Default, the amount of money and/or U.S. government obligations or
	foreign government obligations on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that series at the time of their stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the debt securities of that
	series at the time of the acceleration resulting from the Event of Default. In such a case, we would remain liable for those payments.




	Foreign Government Obligations means, with respect to debt securities of any series that are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed
	by, the government that issued or caused to be issued such currency for the payment of which obligations its full faith and credit is pledged and which are not callable or redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof.





	Regarding the Trustee





	The indenture provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the trustee will perform only such duties as are
	specifically set forth in the indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the trustee will exercise such rights and powers vested in it under the indenture and use the same degree of care and skill in its exercise as a prudent person
	would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such persons own affairs.




	The indenture and provisions
	of the Trust Indenture Act that are incorporated by reference therein contain limitations on the rights of the trustee, should it become one of our creditors, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases or to realize on certain property received by
	it in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The trustee is permitted to engage in other transactions with us or any of our affiliates; provided, however, that if it acquires any conflicting interest (as defined in the indenture or in
	the Trust Indenture Act), it must eliminate such conflict or resign.





	No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees or
	Stockholders





	None of our past, present or future directors, officers, employees or stockholders, as such, will have any
	liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the indenture or for any claim based on, or in respect or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. By accepting a debt security, each holder waives and releases all such
	liability. This waiver and release is part of the consideration for the issue of the debt securities. However, this waiver and release may not be effective to waive liabilities under United States federal securities laws, and it is the view of the
	Securities and Exchange Commission that such a waiver is against public policy.





	Governing Law





	The indenture and the debt securities, including any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the indenture or the debt
	securities, will be governed by the laws of the State of New York (without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof other than Section 5-1401 of the General Obligations Law).

	DESCRIPTION OF COMMON STOCK






	General





	This prospectus
	describes the general terms of the Companys common stock. For a more detailed description of these securities, you should read the applicable provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law, or MGCL, and the Companys charter and
	bylaws. When we offer to sell a particular class or series of stock, we will describe the specific terms of such class or series in a prospectus supplement. Accordingly, for a description of the terms of any class or series of stock, you must refer
	to both the prospectus supplement relating to that class or series and the description of stock in this prospectus. To the extent the information contained in the prospectus supplement differs from this summary description, you should rely on the
	information in the prospectus supplement.




	The Companys charter provides that the Company may issue up to
	490 million shares of common stock, $0.01 par value per share, or common stock. The Companys charter authorizes its board of directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire board and without any action by the Companys
	stockholders, to amend the Companys charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or, subject to the rights of holders of the Companys 8.375% series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock, $0.01 par value per
	share, or the Companys series B preferred stock, and any other class or series of the Companys stock, the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the Company has the authority to issue. As of March 13, 2015,
	79,908,969 shares of the Companys common stock were issued and outstanding, and 5,800,00 shares of the Companys series B preferred stock were outstanding.




	Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are not personally liable for the Companys debts or obligations solely as a result of their status as stockholders.




	Subject to the preferential rights of holders of series B preferred stock and any other class or series of the Companys stock, and
	to the provisions of the Companys charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock, holders of shares of the Companys common stock are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions on such
	shares if, as and when authorized by the Companys board of directors out of funds legally available therefor and declared by the Company, and to share ratably in the Companys assets legally available for distribution to the
	Companys stockholders in the event of the Companys liquidation, dissolution or winding up, after payment or establishment of reserves for all known debts and liabilities of the Company.




	Subject to the provisions of the Companys charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock
	and except as may otherwise be specified in the terms of any class or series of the Companys stock (including the Companys series B preferred stock), each outstanding share of the Companys common stock entitles the holder to one
	vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of directors, and the holders of shares of the Companys common stock will possess the exclusive voting power. There is no cumulative voting in the election of the
	Companys directors. In uncontested elections, directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast for and against each director nominee. In contested elections, directors are elected by a
	plurality of the votes cast. See Material Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Companys Charter and BylawsThe Companys Board of Directors.




	Holders of shares of the Companys common stock have no preference, conversion, exchange, sinking fund or redemption rights, and have no preemptive rights to subscribe for any securities of the
	Company. The Companys charter provides that the Companys stockholders generally have no appraisal rights unless the Companys board of directors determines prospectively that appraisal rights will apply to one or more transactions
	in which holders of the Companys common stock would otherwise be entitled to exercise appraisal rights. Subject to the provisions of the Companys charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock,
	holders of shares of the Companys common stock will have equal dividend, liquidation and other rights.

	Under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation generally cannot dissolve, amend its charter, merge,
	consolidate, convert into another type of entity, sell all or substantially all of its assets or engage in a statutory share exchange unless declared advisable by the board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled
	to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter unless a lesser percentage (but not less than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter) is set forth in the corporations charter. The
	Companys charter provides for the approval of these matters by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except for the limited rights of holders of series B preferred stock described below under the heading Description
	of Preferred Stock8.375% Series B Preferred Stock to approve certain amendments to the Companys charter, and except that the approval of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast is
	required to remove a director elected by holders of the Companys common stock or to amend the removal provisions of the Companys charter or the vote required to amend such provisions. Holders of outstanding shares of series B preferred
	stock, voting together as a single class with the holders of all outstanding shares of any other similarly-affected class or series of parity preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred, have the exclusive right to vote on any
	amendment to the Companys charter on which holders of the Companys series B preferred stock are entitled to vote and that would alter only the contract rights, as expressly set forth in the Companys charter, of the series B
	preferred stock and such other class or series of parity preferred stock, and the holders of any other class or series of the Companys stock, including the Companys common stock, will not be entitled to vote on such an amendment.
	Maryland law also permits a corporation to transfer all or substantially all of its assets without the approval of its stockholders to an entity all of the equity interests of which are owned, directly or indirectly, by the corporation. Because the
	Companys operating assets may be held by our operating partnership or its wholly owned subsidiaries, these subsidiaries may be able to merge or transfer all or substantially all of such assets without the approval of the Companys
	stockholders.




	The Companys charter authorizes the Companys board of directors to reclassify any unissued shares
	of the Companys common stock into other classes or series of stock, to establish the designation and number of shares of each such class or series and to set, subject to the rights of holders of the Companys series B preferred stock and
	any other class or series of the Companys stock, and the provisions of the Companys charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock, the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers,
	restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of each such class or series.





	Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized Shares of Common Stock and Issue Additional Shares of Common Stock





	We believe that the power of the Companys board of directors to amend the Companys charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of common stock, to authorize the
	Company to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of the Companys common stock and to classify or reclassify unissued shares of the Companys common stock and thereafter to cause the Company to issue such classified or
	reclassified shares will provide us with increased flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. Subject to the rights of holders of series B preferred stock to approve the
	classification or issuance of shares, or increase in the number of authorized shares, of a class or series of the Companys stock ranking senior to the series B preferred stock, the additional classes or series of common stock, as well as the
	additional authorized shares of common stock, will be available for issuance without further action by the Companys stockholders unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system
	on which the Companys securities may be listed or traded. Although the Companys board of directors does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize the Company to issue a class or series of stock that could, depending upon the
	terms of the particular class or series, delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the Companys common stock or that the Companys common stockholders otherwise
	believe to be in their best interests. See Material Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Companys Charter and BylawsAnti-takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Companys Charter and Bylaws.

	DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED STOCK






	General





	This prospectus
	describes the general terms of the Companys preferred stock. For a more detailed description of these securities, you should read the applicable provisions of the MGCL and the Companys charter and bylaws. When the Company offers to sell
	a particular class or series of preferred stock, the Company will describe the specific terms of the series in a prospectus supplement. Accordingly, for a description of the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, you must refer to both the
	prospectus supplement relating to that class or series and the description of preferred stock in this prospectus. To the extent the information contained in the prospectus supplement differs from this summary description, you should rely on the
	information in the prospectus supplement.




	The Companys charter provides that the Company may issue up to
	10 million shares of preferred stock, $0.01 par value per share, or preferred stock, of which 5,800,000 shares are classified and designated as shares of series B preferred stock. The Companys charter authorizes the Companys board
	of directors, with the approval of a majority of the entire board and without any action by the Companys stockholders, to amend the Companys charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock or, subject to the
	rights of holders of series B preferred stock to approve any increase in the number of shares of a class or series of stock ranking senior to the Companys series B preferred stock, the number of shares of stock of any class or series that the
	Company has the authority to issue. As of March 13, 2015, 5,800,000 shares of the Companys series B preferred stock are issued and outstanding.




	The Companys charter authorizes the Companys board of directors to classify any unissued shares of preferred stock and to reclassify any previously classified but unissued shares of preferred
	stock into one or more classes or series of stock. Prior to issuance of shares of each new class or series, the Companys board of directors is required by the MGCL and the Companys charter to set, subject to the rights of holders of the
	Companys series B preferred stock and any other class or series of the Companys stock, and the provisions of the Companys charter regarding the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock, the preferences,
	conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of each such class or series. As a result, the Companys board of directors could
	authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock that have priority over shares of the Companys common stock with respect to dividends, distributions or rights upon liquidation or with other terms or conditions that could have the effect of
	delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the Companys common stock or that the Companys common stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best
	interests.




	The specific terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock will be described in the prospectus
	supplement relating to that class or series, including a prospectus supplement providing that preferred stock may be issuable upon the exercise of warrants the Company issues. The description of preferred stock set forth below and the description of
	the terms of a particular class or series of preferred stock set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the articles supplementary relating to that class or
	series.




	Under Maryland law, stockholders generally are not personally liable for the Companys debts or obligations
	solely as a result of their status as stockholders.




	The preferences and other terms of each class or series of preferred
	stock will be fixed by the articles supplementary relating to such class or series. A prospectus supplement relating to each class or series will specify the terms of the class or series of preferred stock as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the designation and par value of such class or series of preferred stock,






	 





	 




	

	whether dividends on such class or series of preferred stock are cumulative or not and, if cumulative, the date from which dividends on such class or
	series of preferred stock shall accumulate,

	any limitations on issuance of any class or series of stock ranking senior to or on a parity with such class or series of preferred stock as to

	




	 





	any voting rights of such class or series of preferred stock, and

	any other specific terms, preferences, rights, limitations or restrictions of such class or series of preferred stock.








	Rank





	Unless otherwise
	specified in the applicable prospectus supplement, the preferred stock will, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, rank: (1) senior to all classes or series of the Companys
	common stock, and to any other class or series of the Companys stock expressly designated as ranking junior to the preferred stock; (2) on parity with any class or series of the Companys stock expressly designated as ranking on
	parity with the preferred stock; and (3) junior to any other class or series of the Companys stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the preferred stock.





	Conversion Rights





	The terms and conditions, if any, upon which any shares
	of any class or series of preferred stock are convertible into shares of the Companys common stock or shares of any other class or series of the Companys stock will be set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement relating thereto.
	Such terms will include the number of shares of the Companys common stock or the number of shares of such other class or series of the Companys stock into which the shares of preferred stock are convertible, the conversion price (or
	manner of calculation thereof), the conversion period, provisions as to whether conversion will be at the option of the holders of such class or series of preferred stock, the events requiring an adjustment of the conversion price and provisions
	affecting conversion in the event of the redemption of such class or series of preferred stock.





	Power to Increase or Decrease Authorized
	Preferred Stock and Issue Additional Shares of The Companys Preferred Stock





	We believe that the power of the
	Companys board of directors to amend the Companys charter to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of preferred stock, to authorize the Company to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of the
	Companys preferred stock in one or more classes or series and

	Table of Contents




	to classify or reclassify unissued shares of the Companys preferred stock and thereafter to cause the Company to issue such classified or reclassified shares will provide us with increased
	flexibility in structuring possible future financings and acquisitions and in meeting other needs that might arise. Subject to the rights of holders of series B preferred stock to approve the classification or issuance of shares, or increase in the
	number of authorized shares, of a class or series of the Companys stock ranking senior to the series B preferred stock, the additional classes or series of preferred stock, as well as the additional authorized shares of preferred stock, will
	be available for issuance without further action by the Companys stockholders unless such action is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which the Companys securities may be
	listed or traded. Although the Companys board of directors does not currently intend to do so, it could authorize the Company to issue a class or series of stock that could, depending upon the terms of the particular class or series, delay,
	defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the Companys common stock or that the Companys common stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests. See
	Material Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Companys Charter and BylawsAnti-takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and of The Companys Charter and Bylaws.





	Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer





	To assist us in complying with certain federal income tax requirements applicable to REITs, the Companys charter contains certain restrictions relating to the ownership and transfer of the
	Companys preferred stock. We expect that similar restrictions with respect to any class or series offered pursuant to this prospectus will be set forth in the articles supplementary for such class or series. The applicable prospectus
	supplement will specify any additional ownership limitation relating to such class or series. See Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer.





	Transfer Agent and Registrar





	The transfer agent and registrar for the
	Companys shares of preferred stock is Computershare Trust Company, N.A.





	8.375% Series B Preferred Stock





	The Company currently has outstanding 5,800,000 shares of its 8.375% series B cumulative redeemable preferred stock, $0.01 par value per
	share, or series B preferred stock. The Companys series B preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol HPP. PrB. Dividends on outstanding shares of the Companys series B preferred stock are cumulative from the date
	of original issue and are payable quarterly in arrears at the rate of 8.375% per annum of its $25.00 liquidation preference, or $2.09375 per annum per share.




	If following a change of control of the Company, either the Companys series B preferred stock (or any preferred stock of the surviving entity that is issued in exchange for the Companys series
	B preferred stock) or the common stock of the surviving entity, as applicable, is not listed on the NYSE or quoted on the NASDAQ Stock Market, or NASDAQ (or listed or quoted on a successor exchange or quotation system), dividends on outstanding
	shares of the Companys series B preferred stock will accrue and be cumulative from, and including, the first date on which both the change of control occurred and either the Companys series B preferred stock (or any preferred stock of
	the surviving entity that is issued in exchange for the Companys series B preferred stock) or the common stock of the surviving entity, as applicable, is not so listed or quoted, at the increased rate of 12.375% per annum per share of the
	liquidation preference of the Companys series B preferred stock (equivalent to $3.09375 per annum per share), for as long as either the Companys series B preferred stock (or any preferred stock of the surviving entity that is issued in
	exchange for the Companys series B preferred stock) or the common stock of the surviving entity, as applicable, is not so listed or quoted.




	Except in instances relating to preservation of the qualification of the Company as a REIT or in connection with a change of control of the Company, the Companys series B preferred stock is not
	redeemable prior to December 10, 2015. On and after December 10, 2015, the Company may redeem its series B preferred stock in

	Table of Contents




	whole, at any time, or in part, from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the date of redemption. If at
	any time following a change of control either the Companys series B preferred stock (or any preferred stock of the surviving entity that is issued in exchange for the Companys series B preferred stock) or the common stock of the
	surviving entity, as applicable, is not listed on the NYSE or quoted on NASDAQ (or listed or quoted on a successor exchange or quotation system), the Company will have the option to redeem its series B preferred stock, in whole but not in part,
	within 90 days after the first date on which both the change of control has occurred and either the Companys series B preferred stock (or any preferred stock of the surviving entity that is issued in exchange for the Companys series B
	preferred stock) or the common stock of the surviving entity, as applicable, is not so listed or quoted, for cash at $25.00 per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date. The Companys series B
	preferred stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding indefinitely unless redeemed by us, and it is not subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption and is not convertible into or exchangeable for any property or any other
	securities.




	Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, holders of the Companys series B preferred
	stock will have the right to receive $25.00 per share, plus an amount per share equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not earned or declared) to, but not including, the date of payment, before any payments or distributions are
	made to holders of the Companys common stock or other junior securities. Holders of the Companys series B preferred stock generally have no voting rights, except that, if the Company is in arrears on dividends on its series B preferred
	stock for six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of the Companys series B preferred stock, voting together as a single class with the holders of all other classes and series of parity preferred stock upon which
	like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will have the right to elect an additional two directors until all such dividends and dividends for the then current quarterly period on the Companys series B preferred stock have
	been paid or declared and set aside for payment in full. In addition, the approval of two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding shares of the Companys series B preferred stock, voting together as a single class
	with holders of all other similarly-affected classes and series of parity preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred, is required to authorize, create or increase the authorized number of shares of any class or series of the
	Companys stock having rights senior to the Companys series B preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends or amounts upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up or to amend the Companys charter, whether by merger,
	consolidation or otherwise, to affect materially and adversely the voting powers, rights or preferences of the Companys series B preferred stock, unless in connection with any such amendment, alteration or repeal, the Companys series B
	preferred stock remains outstanding without the terms thereof being materially and adversely affected or is converted into or exchanged for preferred equity interests in the surviving entity having preferences, conversion and other rights, voting
	powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends, qualifications and terms and conditions of redemption thereof that are substantially similar to those of the Companys series B preferred stock (taking into account that the Company may not be
	the surviving entity).

	RESTRICTIONS ON OWNERSHIP AND TRANSFER






	The following summary with respect to restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock sets forth certain general
	terms and provisions of the Companys charter documents to which any prospectus supplement may relate. This summary does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companys charter
	documents, as amended and supplemented from time to time, including any articles supplementary relating to any class or series of preferred stock offered and sold pursuant to this prospectus. Copies of the Companys existing charter documents
	are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and are incorporated by reference as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Any amendment or supplement to the Companys charter documents relating to an
	issuance of securities pursuant to this prospectus shall be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and shall be incorporated by reference as an exhibit to the applicable prospectus supplement. See Where You Can Find More
	Information; Incorporation by reference.





	In order for the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue
	Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the Companys stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been made) or
	during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year. Also, not more than 50% of the value of the outstanding shares of the Companys stock (after taking into account certain options to acquire shares of stock) may be owned, directly,
	indirectly or through attribution, by five or fewer individuals (for this purpose, the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan, a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or
	used exclusively for charitable purposes, but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust) at any time during the last half of a taxable year (other than the first year for which an election to be a REIT has been
	made).




	The Companys charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of the Companys common stock,
	series B preferred stock and capital stock that are intended to assist the Company in complying with these requirements and continuing to qualify as a REIT. The relevant sections of the Companys charter provide that, subject to the exceptions
	described below, no person or entity may actually or beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of
	the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock or of the Companys series B preferred stock, excluding any shares of common stock or series B preferred stock, respectively, that are not treated as outstanding for federal income tax
	purposes, or more than 9.8% (in value) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of the Companys capital stock. We refer to each of these restrictions as an ownership limit and collectively as the
	ownership limits. A person or entity that would have acquired actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of the Companys stock but for the application of the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and
	transfer of the Companys stock discussed below is referred to as a prohibited owner.




	The constructive
	ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause stock owned actually or constructively by a group of related individuals and/or entities to be owned constructively by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8%
	of the Companys common stock or series B preferred stock (or the acquisition of an interest in an entity that owns, actually or constructively, the Companys common stock or series B preferred stock) by an individual or entity could,
	nevertheless, cause that individual or entity, or another individual or entity, to own constructively in excess of 9.8% in value or in number of shares (whichever is more restrictive) of the Companys outstanding common stock or series B
	preferred stock, as applicable, and thereby violate the applicable ownership limit.




	The Companys board of directors
	may, in its sole and absolute discretion, prospectively or retroactively, waive one or more of the ownership limits with respect to a particular person if, among other limitations, it:



	 





	 




	




	 





	determines that such waiver will not cause any individual (for this purpose, the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment
	compensation benefit plan, a private foundation or a







	 




	24







	Table of Contents






	 





	portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for charitable purposes, but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust) to own, actually or
	beneficially, more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of the Companys capital stock; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	determines that, subject to certain exceptions, such person does not and will not own, actually or constructively, an interest in a tenant of ours (or
	a tenant of any entity owned in whole or in part by us) that would cause the Company to own, actually or constructively, more than a 9.9% interest (as set forth in Section 856(d)(2)(B) of the Code) in such tenant.







	As a condition of such waiver, the Companys board of directors may require an opinion of counsel or IRS ruling satisfactory to the Companys
	board of directors in its sole and absolute discretion in order to determine or ensure the Companys status as a REIT or such representations and/or undertakings as are reasonably necessary to make the determinations above. The Companys
	board of directors may impose such conditions or restrictions as it deems appropriate in connection with such an exception.




	In connection with past offerings of the Companys common stock, the Companys board of directors granted the Farallon Funds
	and certain of their affiliates, which we refer to collectively as the Farallon excepted holders, exemptions from the ownership limits, subject to various conditions and limitations. During the time that such waivers have been or are effective, each
	Farallon excepted holder has been and will be subject to an increased ownership limit applicable to such holder, or the excepted holder limit, as applicable. As a condition to granting such excepted holder limits, the Farallon excepted holders made
	certain representations and covenants to us, including representations that, to their best knowledge, as a result of their ownership of shares of the Companys common stock, no other person (other than our operating partnership) actually,
	beneficially, or constructively owns shares of the Companys common stock in excess of the ownership limit and that, as of certain applicable dates, they did not actually or constructively own, or reasonably anticipate so owning, in excess of
	9.9% (or, in certain cases, 5.45%) of the outstanding equity interests in any of the tenants that we have disclosed to the Farallon excepted holders in accordance with the terms of such waivers. Before we enter into or acquire a lease with a new
	tenant, we are obligated to disclose the new tenant to the Farallon excepted holders, and such holders have one business day to inform us as to whether they actually or constructively own, or reasonably anticipate so owning, more than 9.9% (or, in
	certain cases, 5.45%) of the equity interests in such tenant. If they do own such an interest, if we enter into a lease with that tenant, the rent from that tenant could fail to qualify under the REIT income tests. If this rent could prevent the
	Company from satisfying the REIT gross income tests, then the Companys charter would require that the number of shares owned by the Farallon excepted holders in excess of the ownership limit be automatically transferred to a trust as described
	below. If this occurs, and the Farallon excepted holders gave us advance notice of their tenant ownership as described above, we would be obligated to indemnify the Farallon excepted holders for any damages they suffer as a result of the transfer of
	shares to the trust. In addition, even if the Farallon excepted holders do not own one of our tenants, they may later acquire over 9.9% (or, in certain cases, 5.45%) of the equity interests in that tenant without causing their exemption to be
	terminated, provided that (i) the Companys annual income from that tenant and other tenants in which they own over a 9.9% (or, in certain cases, 5.45%) interest would not exceed 2% of the Companys gross income and the Companys
	annual income from certain tenants to which the lower 5.45% threshold applies would not exceed 2% of the gross income from one of the Companys properties; and (ii) such ownership could not otherwise cause the Company to fail to qualify as
	a REIT. As a result, ownership of our tenants by the Farallon excepted holders may increase the Companys nonqualifying income or prevent us from entering into certain leases with certain tenants. The representations and covenants made by the
	Farallon excepted holders in connection with the granting of the exemptions are intended to ensure that, despite granting such exemptions, the Company will continue to qualify as a REIT. The Farallon excepted holders must inform the Company if any
	of these representations becomes untrue or is violated, in which case they will lose their excepted holder limit. Subject to certain conditions, the Company may reduce the excepted holder limit (but not below the ownership limit) if the Farallon
	excepted holders actually, beneficially or constructively own fewer shares than the excepted holder limit for a specified period. The Companys board of directors has granted to our operating partnership an exemption from the ownership limits.
	In addition, the Companys board of directors has




	 




	25







	Table of Contents




	granted to certain other holders an exemption from the ownership limits, based on certain representations and covenants made to the Company by each such holder regarding its ownership and
	disposition of shares of the Companys common stock or shares of the Companys series B preferred stock. We believe that these exemptions will not jeopardize the Companys status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.




	In connection with a waiver of an ownership limit or at any other time, the Companys board of directors may increase or decrease
	one or more of the ownership limits, except that a decreased ownership limit will not be effective for any person whose actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of the Companys stock exceeds the decreased ownership limit at the time of the
	decrease until the persons actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of the Companys stock equals or falls below the decreased ownership limit, although any further acquisition of the Companys stock will violate the decreased
	ownership limit. The Companys board of directors may not increase or decrease any ownership limit if the new ownership limit would allow five or fewer persons to actually or beneficially own more than 49% in value of the Companys
	outstanding stock or could cause the Company to be closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise cause the Company to
	fail to qualify as a REIT.




	The Companys charter further prohibits:



	 





	 




	




	 





	any person from actually, beneficially or constructively owning shares of the Companys capital stock that could result in the Company being
	closely held under Section 856(h) of the Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise cause the Company to fail to qualify as a REIT; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	any person from transferring shares of the Companys capital stock if such transfer would result in shares of the Companys capital stock
	being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution).







	Any person
	who acquires or attempts or intends to acquire actual, beneficial or constructive ownership of shares of the Companys stock that will or may violate the ownership limits or any of the other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the
	Companys stock described above must give written notice immediately to the Company or, in the case of a proposed or attempted transaction, provide the Company at least 15 days prior notice, and provide the Company with such other information
	as the Company may request in order to determine the effect of such transfer on the Companys status as a REIT.




	The
	ownership limits and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock described above will not apply if the Companys board of directors determines that it is no longer in the Companys best interest to attempt to
	qualify, or to continue to qualify, as a REIT or that compliance with one or more of the restrictions or limitations on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock is no longer required in order for the Company to qualify as a REIT.




	Pursuant to the Companys charter, if any purported transfer of the Companys stock or any other event would
	otherwise result in any person violating the ownership limits or such other limit established by the Companys board of directors, or could result in the Company being closely held within the meaning of Section 856(h) of the
	Code (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise failing to qualify as a REIT, then the number of shares causing the violation (rounded up to the nearest whole share) will be
	automatically transferred to, and held by, a trust for the exclusive benefit of one or more charitable organizations selected by the Company. The prohibited owner will have no rights in shares of the Companys stock held by the trustee. The
	automatic transfer will be effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to the date of the violative transfer or other event that results in the transfer to the trust. Any dividend or other distribution paid to the prohibited
	owner, prior to the Companys discovery that the shares had been automatically transferred to a trust as described above, must be repaid to the trustee upon demand. If the transfer to the trust as described above is not automatically effective,
	for any reason, to prevent violation of the applicable ownership limit or the Company being closely held (without regard to whether the ownership interest is held during the last half of a taxable year) or otherwise failing to qualify as
	a REIT, then the




	 




	26







	Table of Contents




	transfer of the number of shares that otherwise would cause any person to violate the above restrictions will be void. If any transfer of the Companys stock would result in shares of the
	Companys stock being beneficially owned by fewer than 100 persons (determined without reference to any rules of attribution), then any such purported transfer will be void and of no force or effect and the intended transferee will acquire no
	rights in the shares.




	Shares of the Companys stock transferred to the trustee are deemed offered for sale to the
	Company, or the Companys designee, at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) the price per share paid by the prohibited owner for the shares (or, if the prohibited owner did not give value in connection with the transfer or other
	event that resulted in the transfer to the trust (

	e.g.

	, a gift, devise or other such transaction), the last sales price reported on the NYSE on the day of the transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer of such shares to the trust)
	and (2) the last sale price reported on the NYSE on the date the Company, or the Companys designee, accepts such offer. The Company must reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and distributions paid
	to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. The Company will pay the amount of such reduction to the trustee for the benefit of the charitable beneficiary. The Company has the right to accept such offer until the trustee
	has sold the shares of the stock of the Company held in the trust. Upon a sale to the Company, the interest of the charitable beneficiary in the shares sold terminates and the trustee must distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the prohibited
	owner and any dividends or other distributions held by the trustee with respect to such stock must be paid to the charitable beneficiary.




	If the Company does not buy the shares, the trustee must, within 20 days of receiving notice from the Company of the transfer of shares to the trust, sell the shares to a person or persons, designated by
	the trustee, who could own the shares without violating the ownership limits or other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock. Upon such sale, the trustee must distribute to the prohibited owner an amount equal to the
	lesser of (1) the price paid by the prohibited owner for the shares (or, if the prohibited owner did not give value in connection with the transfer or other event that resulted in the transfer to the trust (

	e.g.

	, a gift, devise or other
	such transaction), the last sales price reported on the NYSE on the day of the event that resulted in the transfer of such shares to the trust) and (2) the sales proceeds (net of commissions and other expenses of sale) received by the trustee
	for the shares. The trustee must reduce the amount payable to the prohibited owner by the amount of dividends and other distributions paid to the prohibited owner and owed by the prohibited owner to the trustee. Any net sales proceeds in excess of
	the amount payable to the prohibited owner will be immediately paid to the charitable beneficiary, together with any dividends or other distributions thereon. In addition, if, prior to discovery by the Company that shares of its stock have been
	transferred to the trustee, such shares of stock are sold by a prohibited owner, then such shares shall be deemed to have been sold on behalf of the trust and, to the extent that the prohibited owner received an amount for or in respect of such
	shares that exceeds the amount that such prohibited owner was entitled to receive, such excess amount must be paid to the trustee upon demand.




	The trustee will be designated by the Company and will be unaffiliated with the Company and with any prohibited owner. Prior to the sale of any shares by the trust, the trustee will receive, in trust for
	the charitable beneficiary, all dividends and other distributions paid by the Company with respect to such shares, and may exercise all voting rights with respect to such shares for the exclusive benefit of the charitable beneficiary.




	Subject to Maryland law, effective as of the date that the shares have been transferred to the trust, the trustee will have the
	authority, at the trustees sole discretion:



	 





	 




	




	 





	to rescind as void any vote cast by a prohibited owner prior to the Companys discovery that the shares have been transferred to the trust; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	to recast the vote in accordance with the desires of the trustee acting for the benefit of the beneficiary of the trust.







	However, if the Company has already taken irreversible corporate action, then the trustee may not rescind and recast the vote.

	If the Companys board of directors or a committee thereof determines in good faith
	that a proposed transfer or other event has taken place that violates the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock set forth in the Companys charter, the Companys board of directors or such committee may take
	such action as it deems advisable in its sole discretion to refuse to give effect to or to prevent such transfer, including, but not limited to, causing the company to redeem shares of stock, refusing to give effect to the transfer on the
	Companys books or instituting proceedings to enjoin the transfer.




	Every owner of 5% or more (or such lower percentage
	as required by the Code or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder) of the outstanding shares of the Companys stock, within 30 days after the end of each taxable year, must give written notice to the Company stating the name and
	address of such owner, the number of shares of each class and series of the Companys stock that the owner beneficially owns and a description of the manner in which the shares are held. Each such owner also must provide the Company with any
	additional information that the Company may request in order to determine the effect, if any, of the persons actual or beneficial ownership on the Companys status as a REIT and to ensure compliance with the ownership limits. In addition,
	any person that is an actual, beneficial or constructive owner of shares of the Companys stock and any person (including the stockholder of record) who is holding shares of the Companys stock for an actual, beneficial or constructive
	owner must, on request, disclose to the Company such information as the Company may request in good faith in order to determine the Companys status as a REIT and comply with requirements of any taxing authority or governmental authority or
	determine such compliance.




	Any certificates representing shares of the Companys stock will bear a legend referring to
	the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock described above.




	These restrictions on ownership and
	transfer could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the Company that might involve a premium price for the Companys stock that the Companys stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interest.

	DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT OF HUDSON PACIFIC
	PROPERTIES, L.P.






	We have summarized the material terms and provisions of the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of
	Limited Partnership of Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., which we refer to as the partnership agreement. This summary is not complete. For more detail, you should refer to the partnership agreement itself, a copy of which is filed with
	the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part. For purposes of this section, references to we, our, us, our company and the
	general partner refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. in its capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership.






	General





	All of the
	Companys assets are held by, and substantially all of the Companys operations are conducted through, our operating partnership, either directly or through subsidiaries. The Company is the general partner of our operating partnership,
	and, as of March 13, 2015, the Company owns approximately 97.1% of the outstanding common units in our operating partnership.




	Certain persons who contributed interests in properties and/or other assets pursuant to the formation transactions related to the Companys initial public offering received common units of
	partnership interest in our operating partnership or 6.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Partnership Units of partnership interest in our operating partnership, which we refer to as common units and series A preferred units, respectively. Holders
	of common units are generally entitled to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, our operating partnership in proportion to their respective percentage interests of common units if and to the extent authorized by us and
	subject to the preferential rights of holders of outstanding preferred units, including series A preferred units and 8.375% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units of partnership interest in our operating partnership, which we refer to as
	series B preferred units. Series A preferred units rank senior to any other partnership interest and holders of series A units are entitled to receive preferential cash distributions, a liquidation preference in the event of any voluntary or
	involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our operating partnership (but only to the extent consistent with a liquidation in accordance with positive capital account balances), as well as certain conversion and redemption
	rights as described below in Material Terms of The Companys Series A Preferred Units. Series B preferred units rank junior to the series A preferred units and senior to the common units and, subject to the rights of holders
	of series A preferred units, holders of series B preferred units are entitled to receive preferential cash distributions and a liquidation preference in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
	of our operating partnership that are substantially similar to those of the series B preferred stock (but, in the case of distributions upon the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our operating partnership, only to the extent
	consistent with a liquidation in accordance with positive capital account balances). Series B preferred units are also subject to redemption by our operating partnership in connection with our reacquisition of shares of series B preferred stock. See
	Description of Preferred Stock8.375% Series B Preferred Stock. The units in our operating partnership are not listed on any exchange or quoted on any national market system.




	Provisions in the partnership agreement could discourage third parties from making proposals involving an unsolicited acquisition of the
	Company or change of control of the Company, although some stockholders might consider such proposals, if made, desirable. These provisions also make it more difficult for third parties to alter the management structure of our operating partnership
	without the concurrence of the Companys board of directors. These provisions include, among others:



	 





	 




	




	 





	redemption rights of qualifying parties;






	 





	 




	




	 





	transfer restrictions on units, including the Companys common units;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the Companys ability, as general partner, in some cases, to amend the partnership agreement and to cause the partnership to issue preferred units
	with terms that the Company, in the Companys capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership, may determine, without the consent of the limited partners;







	 




	29







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	the right of the limited partners to consent to transfers of the Companys general partnership interest and mergers under specified circumstances;
	and






	 





	 




	




	 





	restrictions on debt levels and equity requirements pursuant to the terms of the Companys series A preferred units, as well as required
	distributions to holders of series A preferred units of our operating partnership, following certain changes of control of the Company.











	Purposes, Business and Management





	The purpose of our operating partnership
	includes the conduct of any business, enterprise or activity permitted by or under the Maryland Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act. Our operating partnership may enter into partnerships, joint ventures or similar arrangements and may own
	interests in any other entity. However, our operating partnership may not, without the Companys consent, take, or refrain from taking, any action that, in the Companys judgment, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion:



	 





	 




	




	 





	could adversely affect the Companys ability to continue to qualify as a REIT;






	 





	 




	




	 





	could subject the Company to any taxes under Code Section 857 or Code Section 4981 or any other related or successor provision under the
	Code; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	could violate any law or regulation of any governmental body or agency having jurisdiction over us, the Companys securities or our operating
	partnership.







	In general, the Companys board of directors manages the business and affairs of our operating
	partnership by directing the Companys business and affairs, in the Companys capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership.




	Except as otherwise expressly provided in the partnership agreement, all management powers over the business and affairs of our operating partnership are exclusively vested in the Company, in the
	Companys capacity as the general partner of our operating partnership. The general partner may not be removed by the partners with or without cause, except with the general partners consent. Except in connection with certain transactions
	involving the general partner discussed in Restrictions on Mergers, Sales, Transfers and Other Significant Transactions of the General Partner and Material Terms of Series A Preferred UnitsVoting and Consent
	Rights, the general partner may authorize our operating partnership to dispose of any, all or substantially all of the assets (including the goodwill) of our operating partnership or merge, consolidate, reorganize or otherwise combine with or
	into another entity. With limited exceptions, the general partner is authorized to execute, deliver and perform agreements and transactions on behalf of our operating partnership without any further act, approval or vote of the limited partners.





	Restrictions on General Partners Authority





	The general partner may not take any action in contravention of the partnership agreement. The general partner may not, without the prior consent of a majority in interest of the partners (including the
	Company), undertake any actions on behalf of our operating partnership, or enter into any transaction, that would have the effect of amending, modifying or terminating the partnership agreement, except as provided in the partnership agreement. For a
	description of the provisions of the partnership agreement permitting the general partner to amend the partnership agreement without the consent of the limited partners see Amendment of the Partnership AgreementAmendment by the
	General Partner without the Consent of the Limited Partners. The general partner may not, without the prior consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners holding common units (excluding the Company and any limited partner a
	majority of whose equity is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company), transfer all or any portion of its interest in our operating partnership, withdraw as the general partner of our operating partnership or admit into our operating
	partnership any successor general partners, subject to the exceptions discussed in Transfers and WithdrawalsRestrictions on Transfers by General Partner.

	Table of Contents




	In addition, the general partner may not amend the partnership agreement or take any action
	on behalf of our operating partnership, without the prior consent of each partner adversely affected by such amendment or action, if such amendment or action would:



	 





	 




	




	 





	convert a limited partner into a general partner;






	 





	 




	




	 





	modify the limited liability of a limited partner;






	 





	 




	




	 





	alter the rights of any limited partner to receive the distributions to which such partner is entitled, or alter the allocations specified in the
	partnership agreement, except in connection with the creation and issuance of any class or series of units, to the extent permitted by the partnership agreement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	alter or modify the redemption rights or conversion rights of limited partners and certain qualifying assignees or the related definitions;






	 





	 




	




	 





	alter the restrictions on the general partners ability to transfer all or any portion of its interest in our operating partnership or voluntarily
	withdraw as the general partner;






	 





	 




	




	 





	enter into any contract, mortgage, loan or other agreement that expressly prohibits or restricts, or has the effect of prohibiting or restricting, the
	general partner or our operating partnership from performing its obligations in connection with the redemption of units or any limited partner from exercising its redemption or conversion rights under the partnership agreement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	remove, alter or amend certain provisions of the partnership agreement related to the requirements for the Company to qualify as a REIT or permitting
	the Company to avoid paying tax under Code Sections 857 or 4981;






	 





	 




	




	 





	reduce any limited partners rights to indemnification;






	 





	 




	




	 





	create any liability of the limited partners not already provided in the partnership agreement; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	amend the provisions of the partnership agreement requiring the consent of each affected partner before taking any of the actions described above.








	Additional Limited Partners





	Subject to the rights of limited partners holding series A preferred units, the general partner may cause our operating partnership to issue additional units from time to time, on terms and conditions and
	for such capital contributions as may be established by the general partner in its sole and absolute discretion. The net capital contribution need not be equal for all limited partners. No person may be admitted as an additional limited partner
	without the general partners consent, which consent may be given or withheld in its sole and absolute discretion.




	Subject to the rights of the limited partners holding series A preferred units, any additional units may be issued in one or more
	classes, or one or more series of any of such classes, with such designations, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers or rights, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption
	(including, without limitation, terms that may be senior or otherwise entitled to preference over existing units) as the general partner shall determine, in its sole and absolute discretion without the approval of any limited partner or any other
	person.








	Ability to Engage in Other Businesses; Conflicts of Interest





	The Company may not conduct any business other than in connection with the ownership, acquisition and disposition of partnership
	interests, the management of the business of our operating partnership, the Companys operation as a reporting company with a class or classes of securities registered under the Exchange Act, the Companys operations as a REIT, the
	offering, sale, syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities or other interests related to the partnership or its assets or activities or the Companys activities in its capacity as general partner, financing or
	refinancing of any type related to our operating partnership or its assets or activities, and such activities as are incidental to those activities discussed above. The Company may,




	 




	31







	Table of Contents




	however, in its sole and absolute discretion, from time to time hold or acquire assets in the Companys own name or otherwise other than through our operating partnership so long as the
	Company takes commercially reasonable measures to ensure that the economic benefits and burdens of such property are otherwise vested in our operating partnership.





	Distributions





	The Company is required to cause our operating partnership
	to distribute quarterly, or on a more or less frequent basis as the Company may determine, all, or such portion as the Company may in the Companys sole and absolute discretion determine, of the available cash (as such term is defined in the
	partnership agreement) generated by our operating partnership during such quarter to the Company and the limited partners:



	 





	 




	




	 





	first, with respect to the series A preferred units and any other units that are entitled to any preference in distribution, in accordance with the
	rights of such class or classes of units, and, within such class or classes, among the holders of such units, pro rata in proportion to their respective percentage interests;






	 





	 




	




	 





	second, with respect to the series B preferred units and any other units ranking on parity with the series B preferred units as to distributions, in
	accordance with the rights of holders of such units, as applicable, and, within such class, among the holders of such units, pro rata in proportion to their respective percentage interests; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	third, with respect to any units that are not entitled to any preference in distribution, including common units, in accordance with the rights of
	holders of such units, as applicable, and, within such class, among the holders of such units, pro rata in proportion to their respective percentage interests.








	The Companys Liability





	The Company, as general partner of our
	operating partnership, is ultimately liable for all general recourse obligations of our operating partnership to the extent not paid by our operating partnership. The Company is not liable for the nonrecourse obligations of our operating
	partnership.





	Exculpation and Indemnification





	The partnership agreement generally provides that the Company, as general partner, and any of the Companys respective directors or officers will incur no liability to our operating partnership, or
	any limited partner or assignee, for losses sustained or liabilities incurred or benefits not derived as a result of errors in judgment, mistakes of fact or law or any acts or omissions if the Company or such officer or director acted in good faith.
	The partnership agreement also provides that the Company will not be liable to our operating partnership or any partner for monetary damages for losses sustained, liabilities incurred or benefits not derived by our operating partnership or any
	limited partner, except for liability for the Companys intentional harm or gross negligence. In addition, the Company, as general partner, is not responsible to the partnership for any misconduct or negligence on the part of the Companys
	employees or agents, provided the Company appointed such employees or agents in good faith. The Company, as general partner, may consult with legal counsel, accountants, appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants
	and advisors, and any action the Company takes or omits to take in reliance upon the opinion of such persons, as to matters which the Company, as general partner, reasonably believes to be within their professional or expert competence, will be
	conclusively presumed to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.




	The partnership
	agreement also provides for the indemnification of us, as general partner, and the Companys directors, officers and employees, officers and employees of our operating partnership and such other persons as the Company, as general partner, may
	from time to time designate from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses, judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings that
	relate to the operations of our operating




	 




	32







	Table of Contents




	partnership, provided that such person will not be indemnified for (i) any act or omission of such person that was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed
	in bad faith or was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty, (ii) in the case of any criminal proceeding, any act or omission that such person had reason to believe was unlawful, or (iii) any transaction for which such person
	actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or otherwise, in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement. Our operating partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any
	such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation of the persons good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately
	determined that the person did not meet the standard of conduct for indemnification. Our operating partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action initiated by the person seeking indemnification (other than
	an action to enforce such persons right to indemnification under the partnership agreement) without the Companys approval or if the person is found to be liable to our operating partnership on any portion of any claim in the action.




	The partnership agreement also provides for the indemnification of each of the limited partners of our operating partnership,
	their affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers, stockholders and any other individual acting on its or their behalf, from and against any costs incurred by such person resulting from any litigation or other proceeding in which any
	limited partner is named as a defendant or any claim threatened or asserted against any limited partner that relates to the operations of our operating partnership or any obligation assumed by our operating partnership, unless such costs are the
	result of intentional harm or gross negligence on the part of, or a breach of partnership agreement by, such limited partner.





	Sales of
	Partnership Assets; Mergers; Consolidations





	Under the partnership agreement, the general partner generally has the
	authority to cause our operating partnership to sell all or substantially all of the assets of our operating partnership or to merge, consolidate or otherwise combine its assets with another entity, without the consent or approval of any limited
	partner, subject to certain limitations described below. However, in connection with the acquisition of properties from persons to whom the general partner issued units as part of the purchase price, in order to preserve such persons tax
	deferral, the general partner may contractually agree, in general, not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties for a specified period of time, or in some instances, not to sell or otherwise transfer the properties without compensating the
	sellers of the properties for their loss of the tax deferral.





	Redemption Rights of Limited Partners





	After 14 months of becoming a holder of common units, each limited partner and some assignees have the right, subject to the terms and
	conditions set forth in the partnership agreement, to require our operating partnership to redeem all or a portion of the common units held by such party in exchange for a cash amount per common unit equal to the value of one share of the
	Companys common stock, as determined in accordance with, and subject to adjustment as provided in, the partnership agreement. Our operating partnerships obligation to effect a redemption, however, will not arise or be binding against our
	operating partnership unless and until the Company, as general partner, declines or fails to exercise the Companys prior and independent right to acquire such common units in exchange for common stock.




	On or before the close of business on the fifth business day after a limited partner gives the Company notice of redemption with respect
	to common units, the Company may, in the Companys sole and absolute discretion but subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock discussed in Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer, acquire some
	or all of the tendered common units from the tendering party in exchange for shares of common stock, based on an exchange ratio of one share of common stock for each common unit, subject to adjustment as provided in the partnership agreement. The
	partnership agreement does not obligate the Company to register, qualify or list any common stock issued in exchange for common units with the Securities and Exchange Commission, with any state securities commissioner, department or agency, or




	 




	33







	Table of Contents




	with any stock exchange. Common stock issued in exchange for common units pursuant to the partnership agreement may contain legends regarding restrictions under the Securities Act and applicable
	state securities laws as the Company in good faith determines to be necessary or advisable in order to ensure compliance with securities laws.




	Our operating partnership is required to redeem series B preferred units from the Companying connection with any redemption byte Company of shares of series B preferred stock. See Description of
	Preferred Stock8.375% Series B Preferred Stock.




	The partnership agreement also provides redemption rights with
	respect to the Companys series A preferred units as described below in Material Terms of The Companys Series A Preferred Units.





	Transfers and Withdrawals





	The partnership agreement restricts the
	transferability of units. Any transfer or purported transfer of a unit not made in accordance with the partnership agreement will be void.






	Restrictions on Transfer by Limited Partners






	Until the expiration of 14 months from the date on which a limited partner first acquired units, such limited partner generally may not, without the Companys consent, directly or indirectly transfer
	all or any portion of its units to any transferee, except for certain permitted transfers to certain affiliates, family members and charities, transfers by a person who was a limited partner upon the completion of the Companys initial public
	offering to its shareholders, members, partners or beneficiaries and certain pledges of units to lending institutions in connection with bona fide loans.




	In addition, except in the case of permitted transfers, the Company has a right of first refusal with respect to any proposed transfers by other limited partners, exercisable within ten business days of
	notice of the transfer and a description of the proposed consideration to be paid for our operating partnership units.






	Restrictions on
	Transfers by General Partner






	The Company, as general partner, may not transfer any of the Companys units or
	other partnership interest, whether by sale, disposition, statutory merger or consolidation, liquidation or otherwise, unless:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the Company transfers its units in a merger, consolidation or other combination of the Companys assets with another entity, a sale of all or
	substantially all of the Companys assets or a reclassification, recapitalization or change in any outstanding shares of the Companys stock described below in Restrictions on Mergers, Sales, Transfers and Other Significant
	Transactions of the General Partner or the Company receives the prior consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners holding common units (excluding the Company and any limited partner whose equity is owned, directly or indirectly,
	by the Company);






	 





	 




	




	 





	the transferee is admitted as a general partner pursuant to the terms of the partnership agreement;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the transferee assumes, by operation of law or express agreement, all of the obligations of the general partner under the partnership agreement with
	respect to such transferred partnership interest; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	the transferee has executed such instruments as may be necessary to effectuate such admission and to confirm the agreement of such transferee to be
	bound by all the terms and provisions of the partnership agreement with respect to the partnership interest so acquired and the admission of such transferee as the general partner.

	Withdrawal of Partners






	The Company may not voluntarily withdraw as a general partner of our operating partnership without the consent of a majority in interest
	of the limited partners holding common units (excluding the Company and any limited partner 50% or more of whose equity is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company) other than upon the transfer of the Companys entire interest in our
	operating partnership and the admission of the Companys successor as a general partner of our operating partnership. A limited partner of our operating partnership may withdraw from our operating partnership only as a result of a transfer of
	the limited partners entire interest in our operating partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement and the admission of the limited partners successor as a limited partner of our operating partnership or as a result of the
	redemption or acquisition by the Company of the limited partners entire interest in our operating partnership.





	Restrictions on
	Mergers, Sales, Transfers and Other Significant Transactions of the General Partner





	The Company may not merge, consolidate
	or otherwise combine the Companys assets with another entity, or sell all or substantially all of the Companys assets not in the ordinary course of the Companys business, or reclassify, recapitalize or change the terms of the
	Companys outstanding common equity interests (other than in connection with a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, change in par value, increase in authorized shares, designation or issuance of new classes of equity securities or
	any event that does not require the approval of the Companys stockholders), unless:

	such event has been approved by the consent of a majority in interest of the partners, including the Company, and all limited partners holding common
	units will receive, or will have the right to elect to receive, for each common unit, consideration that is equivalent to the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property received by a holder of one share of the Companys common stock;
	and, if such event occurs in connection with a purchase, tender or exchange offer, each holder of common units has the right to receive, or elect to receive, the greatest amount of cash, securities or other property that such holder of units would
	have received had it exercised its right to redemption pursuant to the partnership agreement and received shares of the Companys common stock in exchange for its units immediately before the expiration of the purchase, tender or exchange offer
	and had accepted the purchase, tender or exchange offer; or

	substantially all of the assets of our operating partnership are to be owned by a surviving entity in which the limited partners holding common units
	will hold a percentage interest based on the relative fair market value of the net assets of our operating partnership and the other net assets of such entity, which interest will be on terms that are at least as favorable as the terms of the common
	units and will include a right to redeem interests in such entity for the consideration described in the preceding bullet, cash on similar terms as those with respect to the common units or, if common equity securities of the person controlling the
	surviving entity are publicly traded, such common equity securities.








	Material Terms of Our Operating Partnerships
	Series A Preferred Units





	The following is a discussion of certain of the rights, privileges and preferences of the series
	A preferred units.






	Liquidation Preference






	In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our operating partnership, holders of series A preferred units will be entitled to receive and be paid
	in cash an amount equal to $25.00 per preferred unit plus any accrued and unpaid distributions before any distribution or payment may be made with respect to any other series or class of partnership interest ranking junior to the series A preferred
	units (but only to the extent consistent with a liquidation in accordance with positive capital account balances).

	Table of Contents






	Distributions






	Holders of series A preferred units are entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by our operating partnership, out of available cash, cumulative preferential cash distributions in an amount equal to
	6.25% per annum of the $25.00 liquidation preference per unit from the date of issuance of such unit, payable quarterly in arrears on or before the last calendar day of March, June, September and December of each year. Distributions that are
	due but unpaid will accumulate and compound quarterly. If any such preferential distribution payments for any past quarterly period are in arrears, no distributions may be authorized or paid on any other series or class of partnership interest
	ranking junior to the series A preferred units, nor shall any other series or class of partnership interests ranking junior to the series A preferred units be redeemed, purchased or acquired by our operating partnership or us, except for:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a redemption of common units from the Company in connection with a redemption or repurchase by the Company of common stock for cash pursuant to the
	restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Companys stock described in Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer or a redemption of preferred units from the Company in connection with a redemption or repurchase by the Company of
	outstanding preferred stock for cash;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the acquisition by the Company of common units tendered for redemption with shares of the Companys common stock; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	the conversion into or exchange for shares of the Companys common stock or units ranking junior to the series A preferred units with no cash
	distributed.









	Redemption Rights






	Beginning on June 29, 2013, each limited partner holding series A preferred units and certain assignees has had the right, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership agreement,
	to require our operating partnership to redeem all or a portion of its series A preferred units in exchange for a cash redemption price equal to $25.00 per unit plus any accrued distributions that have not been paid on or prior to the redemption
	date. Our operating partnerships obligation to effect a redemption, however, will not arise or be binding against our operating partnership unless and until the Company, as general partner, declines or fails to exercise the Companys
	prior and independent right to acquire such preferred units in exchange for shares of the Companys common stock that are issued under an effective registration statement under the Securities Act.






	Conversion Rights






	Beginning on June 29, 2013, each limited partner holding series A preferred units and certain assignees has had the right, subject to
	the terms and conditions set forth in the partnership agreement, to convert all or any portion of its series A preferred units into a number of common units with a value equal to the aggregate redemption price of the series A preferred units
	tendered for conversion, the value of such common units to be based on the ten-day trailing average closing price of the Companys common stock calculated as of the business day immediately prior to the date of redemption. Any such conversion
	of series A preferred units will be deemed to have been made at the close of business on the date that the Company, as general partner, receive notice of conversion.




	In the event of a recapitalization, reclassification or change of outstanding common units (other than a subdivision or combination of outstanding common units), a merger, sale or other business
	combination of our operating partnership, a sale, conveyance or lease to another or entity of all or substantially all of our operating partnerships property and assets (other than to one or more of our subsidiaries) or an exchange of
	substantially all of the outstanding common units for securities of another entity, in each case in which holders of common units are entitled to receive securities, other property or assets with respect to or in exchange for their common units,
	qualifying holders of series A preferred units will thereafter be entitled to convert their series A preferred units into the kind and amount of securities or other consideration that such holder would have owned or been entitled to receive upon
	such a business combination if such holder had converted its series A preferred units into common units immediately before the business combination.

	Voting and Consent Rights






	Generally, the series A preferred units are entitled to limited voting rights and in most cases vote on an as-converted basis with the
	holders of common units on any matter on which all limited partners are entitled to vote. However, so long as any series A preferred units remain outstanding, the consent of the limited partners holding a majority in interest of series A preferred
	units other than any limited partner 50% or more of whose equity is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company will be required to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	authorize, designate or issue any class or series of partnership interests ranking

	pari passu

	with or senior to the series A preferred units
	with respect to payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of our operating partnership;






	 





	 




	




	 





	increase the authorized or issued amount of series A preferred units; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	amend, alter or repeal the terms of the series A preferred units, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all
	of our operating partnerships assets or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any right, preference or privilege of the series A preferred units, except that, so long as the series A preferred units remain outstanding following
	any such merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or substantially all of our operating partnerships assets with the terms thereof materially unchanged, taking into account that, upon the occurrence of such an event, our operating
	partnership may not be the surviving entity and the surviving entity may not be a limited partnership, the occurrence of such an event will not be deemed to materially and adversely affect the rights, preferences or privileges of the series A
	preferred units and, in such case, no consent of limited partners holding series A preferred units would be required.






	 





	 




	




	 





	except as discussed below under General Partner Fundamental Change, effect a fundamental change, which is generally
	defined as a merger, consolidation or other combination of the Companys assets with another entity, a sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets not in the ordinary course of the Companys business, a reclassification,
	recapitalization or change in the terms of the Companys outstanding common equity interests (other than in connection with a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, change in par value, increase in authorized shares, designation or
	issuance of new classes of equity securities or any event that does not require the approval of the Companys stockholders), as a result of which the Companys stock ceases to be publicly traded or common units cease to be exchangeable (at
	the Companys option) for publicly traded shares of the Companys stock.









	General Partner Fundamental Change






	Without the approval of limited partners holding a majority in interest of the series A preferred units, the Company
	may not engage in a fundamental change, unless upon consummation of such a fundamental change transaction the partnership agreement or other organizational documents of any successor to our operating partnership will contain certain
	provisions requiring:



	 





	 




	




	 





	our operating partnership or such successor to make minimum tax distributions to holders of the Companys series A preferred units;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the Company or its successor to continue to own an aggregate of at least 33% of the equity in our operating partnership through the ownership of equity
	interests which are subordinate to our operating partnerships series A preferred units; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	our operating partnership or such successor to refrain from incurring additional indebtedness if its ratio of total indebtedness to gross asset value
	exceeds 50%, or allow this leverage ratio to exceed 60%, so long as series A preferred units remain outstanding.







	In connection with any fundamental change transaction, our operating partnership has the right to redeem all or any portion of the then outstanding series A preferred units for cash per unit equal to the
	redemption price.

	MATERIAL PROVISIONS OF MARYLAND LAW AND OF THE COMPANYS
	CHARTER AND BYLAWS






	The following summary of certain provisions of Maryland law and the Companys charter and
	bylaws does not purport to be complete and is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to Maryland law and the Companys charter and bylaws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this
	prospectus is a part. See Where You Can Find More Information; Incorporation by Reference.






	The Companys Board of
	Directors





	The Companys charter and bylaws provide that the number of directors of the Company may be established,
	increased or decreased only by a majority of the Companys entire board of directors but may not be fewer than the minimum number required under the MGCL nor, unless the Companys bylaws are amended, more than 15.




	At each annual meeting of the Companys stockholders, the stockholders will elect each of the Companys directors to serve
	until the next annual meeting of the Companys stockholders and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies under the MGCL. Holders of shares of the Companys common stock will have no right to cumulative voting in the
	election of directors. In uncontested elections, directors are elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of all the votes cast for and against each director nominee. In contested elections, directors are elected by a
	plurality of the votes cast. An election will be considered to be contested if the Companys secretary has received notice that a stockholder has nominated or proposes to nominate one or more persons for election as a director, which notice
	complies or purports to comply with the requirements for advance notice of stockholder nominations set forth in the Companys bylaws, and the nomination or proposed nomination has not been withdrawn at least 14 days prior to the date that the
	Companys proxy statement with respect to the meeting at which such nomination or proposed nomination would be made is first released to stockholders and would thereby cause the number of nominees and proposed nominees to exceed the number of
	directors to be elected at the meeting, irrespective of whether such notice complies with the requirements for advance notice of stockholder nominations set forth in the Companys bylaws or such nomination or proposed nomination is thereafter
	withdrawn by such stockholder.




	Additionally, in the event that the Company is in arrears on dividends on its series B
	preferred stock for six or more quarterly periods, whether or not consecutive, holders of the Companys series B preferred stock, voting together as a single class with all other classes and series of parity preferred stock upon which like
	voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, will have the right to elect an additional two directors until all such dividends and dividends for the then current quarterly period on the series B preferred stock have been paid or declared
	and set aside for payment in full.




	The Company has elected by a provision of its charter to be subject to a provision of
	Maryland law requiring that, except as otherwise provided in the terms of any class or series of the Companys stock, vacancies on the Companys board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors and that any individual
	elected to fill a vacancy will serve for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until his or her successor is duly elected and qualifies. The Companys charter provides that holders of series
	B preferred stock and parity preferred stock may fill vacancies among the directors entitled to be elected by the holders of series B preferred stock and parity preferred stock.





	Removal of Directors





	The Companys charter provides that, subject to
	the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of preferred stock to elect or remove one or more directors, a director may be removed only for cause (as defined in the Companys charter) and only by the affirmative vote of at least
	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors. This provision, when coupled with the exclusive power of the Companys




	 




	38







	Table of Contents




	board of directors to fill vacant directorships (other than vacancies among any directors elected by holders of the Companys series B preferred stock pursuant to their right to elect an
	additional two directors to the Companys board in certain circumstances as described above), may preclude stockholders from removing incumbent directors and filling the vacancies created by such removal with their own nominees. In
	addition, any director elected to the Companys board by the holders of the Companys series B preferred stock and any class or series of parity preferred stock in the circumstances described above may only be removed by a vote of the
	holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock and all classes and series of such parity preferred stock.





	Business Combinations





	Under the MGCL, certain business combinations (including a merger, consolidation, statutory share exchange or, in certain
	circumstances specified under the statute, an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities) between a Maryland corporation and any interested stockholder, or an affiliate of such an interested stockholder, are prohibited for
	five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Maryland law defines an interested stockholder as:



	 





	 




	




	 





	any person who beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting power of the corporations outstanding voting stock; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10%
	or more of the voting power of the then-outstanding voting stock of the corporation.







	A person is not an interested
	stockholder if the board of directors approved in advance the transaction by which the person otherwise would have become an interested stockholder. In approving a transaction, however, the board of directors may provide that its approval is subject
	to compliance, at or after the time of the approval, with any terms and conditions determined by it.




	After such five-year
	period, any such business combination must be recommended by the board of directors of the corporation and approved by the affirmative vote of at least:



	 





	 




	




	 





	80% of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of voting stock of the corporation; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of voting stock of the corporation other than shares held by the interested stockholder with
	whom (or with whose affiliate) the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder.







	These supermajority approval requirements do not apply if, among other conditions, the corporations common stockholders receive a minimum price (as defined in the MGCL) for their shares and the
	consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its shares.




	These
	provisions of the MGCL do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a corporations board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the
	statute, the Companys board of directors has by resolution exempted from the business combination provisions of the MGCL, and, consequently, the five-year prohibition and the supermajority vote requirements will not apply to, business
	combinations between the Company and any interested stockholder that have been approved by the Companys board, including a majority of the Companys directors who are not affiliated with the interested stockholder, unless the
	Companys board in the future alters or repeals this resolution. As a result, anyone who is or later becomes an interested stockholder may be able to enter into business combinations with the Company without compliance by the Company with the
	five-year moratorium, supermajority vote requirements and the other provisions of the statute.




	 




	39







	Table of Contents




	The Company cannot assure you that its board of directors will not opt to be subject to such
	business combination provisions in the future. However, an alteration or repeal of this resolution will not have any effect on any business combinations that have been consummated or upon any agreements existing at the time of such modification or
	repeal.





	Control Share Acquisitions





	The MGCL provides that a holder of control shares of a Maryland corporation acquired in a control share acquisition has no voting rights with respect to such shares except to the
	extent approved by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by stockholders entitled to exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power in the election of directors generally but excluding: (1) the person
	who has made or proposes to make the control share acquisition, (2) any officer of the corporation or (3) any employee of the corporation who is also a director of the corporation. Control shares are voting shares of stock
	that, if aggregated with all other such shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer or in respect of which the acquirer is able to exercise or direct the exercise of voting power (except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy), would entitle
	the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges:



	 





	 




	




	 





	one-tenth or more but less than one-third;






	 





	 




	




	 





	one-third or more but less than a majority; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	a majority or more of all voting power.







	Control shares do not include shares that the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder approval. A control share acquisition means the
	acquisition, directly or indirectly, of ownership of, or the power to direct the exercise of voting power with respect to, issued and outstanding control shares, subject to certain exceptions.




	A person who has made or proposes to make a control share acquisition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions (including an undertaking
	to pay expenses and making an acquiring person statement as described in the MGCL), may compel the board of directors to call a special meeting of stockholders to be held within 50 days of demand to consider the voting rights of the
	control shares. If no request for a special meeting is made, the corporation may itself present the question at any stockholders meeting.




	If voting rights of control shares are not approved at the meeting or if the acquiring person does not deliver an acquiring person statement as required by the statute, then, subject to
	certain conditions and limitations, the corporation may redeem any or all of the control shares (except those for which voting rights have previously been approved) for fair value determined, without regard to the absence of voting rights for the
	control shares, as of the date of the last control share acquisition by the acquirer or of any meeting of stockholders at which the voting rights of such shares are considered and not approved. If voting rights for control shares are approved at a
	stockholders meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights. The fair value of the shares as determined for purposes of such appraisal rights may not
	be less than the highest price per share paid by the acquirer in the control share acquisition.




	The control share acquisition
	statute does not apply (1) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or statutory share exchange if the corporation is a party to the transaction or (2) to acquisitions approved or exempted by the charter or bylaws of the corporation.




	The Companys bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all control share
	acquisitions by any person of shares of the Companys stock. The Companys board of directors may amend or eliminate this provision at any time in the future.

	Table of Contents





	Subtitle 8





	Subtitle 8 of Title 3 of the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation with a class of equity securities registered under the Exchange Act and at least three independent directors to elect to be subject, by
	provision in its charter or bylaws or a resolution of its board of directors and notwithstanding any contrary provision in the charter or bylaws, to any or all of the following five provisions:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a classified board;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a two-thirds vote requirement for removing a director;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a requirement that the number of directors be fixed only by vote of the directors;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a requirement that a vacancy on the board be filled only by the remaining directors and for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in
	which the vacancy occurred; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	a majority requirement for the calling of a special meeting of stockholders.







	The Company has elected by a provision in its charter to be subject to the provisions of Subtitle 8 relating to the filling of vacancies
	on the Companys board of directors. Through provisions in the Companys charter and bylaws unrelated to Subtitle 8, the Company already (1) requires a two-thirds vote for the removal of any director elected by holders of the
	Companys common stock from the board, which removal must be for cause, (2) vests in the board the exclusive power to fix the number of directorships, subject to limitations set forth in the Companys charter and bylaws, and
	(3) requires, unless called by the chairman of the Companys board of directors, the Companys president, the Companys chief executive officer or the Companys board of directors, the request of stockholders entitled to
	cast not less than a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on a matter at such meeting to call a special meeting to consider and vote on any matter that may properly be considered at a meeting of stockholders. The Company has not elected to
	create a classified board. In the future, the Companys board of directors may elect, without stockholder approval, to create a classified board or adopt one or more of the other provisions of Subtitle 8.





	Amendments to The Companys Charter and Bylaws





	The Companys charter generally may be amended only if such amendment is declared advisable by the Companys board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of stockholders entitled to
	cast a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, except that (i) the provisions of the Companys charter relating to the removal of directors and the vote required to amend the removal provision may be amended only with the
	approval of stockholders entitled to cast at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter and (ii) certain amendments to the Companys charter, whether by merger, consolidation, transfer or conveyance of all or
	substantially all of the Companys assets, or otherwise, that would materially and adversely affect the terms of the Companys series B preferred stock must be approved by the holders of the outstanding shares of the Companys series
	B preferred stock entitled to cast at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, voting together as a single class with holders of shares of any similarly-affected class or series of parity preferred stock upon which like
	voting rights have been conferred. Holders of outstanding shares of series B preferred stock, voting together as a single class with the holders of outstanding shares of any other similarly- affected class or series of parity preferred stock upon
	which like voting rights have been conferred, have the exclusive right to vote on any amendments to the Companys charter on which holders of series B preferred stock are entitled to vote and that would alter only the contract rights, as
	expressly set forth in the Companys charter, of the series B preferred stock and such other class(es) and series of parity preferred stock, and the holders of shares of any other class(es) or series of the Companys stock, including the
	Companys common stock, will not be entitled to vote on such an amendment. The Companys board of directors has the exclusive power to adopt, alter or repeal any provision of the Companys bylaws or to make new bylaws.





	Meetings of Stockholders





	Under the Companys bylaws, annual meetings of stockholders will be held each year at a date and time determined by the
	Companys board of directors. Special meetings of stockholders may be called only by the




	 




	41







	Table of Contents




	Companys board of directors, the chairman of the Companys board of directors, the Companys president or the Companys chief executive officer. Additionally, subject to the
	provisions of the Companys bylaws, special meetings of the stockholders to act on any matter must be called by the Companys secretary upon the written request of stockholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes entitled to
	be cast at such meeting on such matter who have requested the special meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in, and provided the information and certifications required by, the Companys bylaws. In addition, at any time that
	holders of the Companys series B preferred stock and any other class or series of parity preferred stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred have the right to elect two directors, but such directors have not been elected, the
	Companys secretary is required to call a special meeting for the purpose of electing the preferred stock directors upon the written request of the holders of record of 10% of the outstanding shares of series B preferred stock and such parity
	preferred stock, if this request is received more than 90 days before the date fixed for the Companys next annual meeting of the Companys stockholders. Only matters set forth in the notice of the special meeting may be considered and
	acted upon at such a meeting.





	Advance Notice of Director Nominations and New Business





	The Companys bylaws provide that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to the Companys board of directors and the proposal of
	business to be considered by stockholders at the annual meeting may be made only:






	 





	 




	




	 





	pursuant to the Companys notice of the meeting;






	 





	 




	




	 





	by or at the direction of the Companys board of directors; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record both at the time the stockholder provides the notice required by the Companys bylaws and at the
	time of the annual meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated or such other business and who has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in, and provided the information and
	certifications required by, the Companys bylaws; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	with respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in the Companys notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting
	of stockholders, and nominations of individuals for election to the Companys board of directors may be made only:






	 





	 




	




	 





	by or at the direction of the Companys board of directors; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	provided that the meeting has been called in accordance with the Companys bylaws for the purpose of electing directors, by a stockholder who is a
	stockholder of record both at the time the stockholder provides the notice required by the Companys bylaws and at the time of the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting in the election of each individual so nominated and who has
	complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in, and provided the information and certifications required by, the Companys bylaws.







	The purpose of requiring stockholders to give advance notice of nominations and other proposals is to afford the Companys board of directors the opportunity to consider the qualifications of the
	proposed nominees or the advisability of the other proposals and, to the extent considered necessary by the Companys board of directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations regarding the nominations or other proposals. Although the
	Companys bylaws do not give the Companys board of directors the power to disapprove timely stockholder nominations and proposals, the Companys bylaws may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or
	proposals for other action if the proper procedures are not followed, and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors to the Companys board of directors or to approve
	its own proposal.

	Anti-takeover Effect of Certain Provisions of Maryland Law and The Companys Charter and Bylaws





	The supermajority vote required to remove directors, the Companys election to be subject to the provision of
	Subtitle 8 generally vesting in the Companys board of directors the exclusive power to fill vacancies on the Companys board of directors, the limited rights of holders of series B preferred stock to vote on certain mergers or
	consolidations involving the Company or transfers of all or substantially all of the Companys assets and the advance notice provisions of the Companys bylaws could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control of the
	Company that might involve a premium price for the Companys common stock or that the Companys common stockholders otherwise believe to be in their best interests. Likewise, if the Companys board of directors were to elect to be
	subject to the provision of Subtitle 8 providing for a classified board or if the provision in the Companys bylaws opting out of the control share acquisition provisions of the MGCL were amended or rescinded, these provisions of the MGCL could
	have similar anti-takeover effects.





	Indemnification and Limitation of Directors and Officers Liability





	Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to
	the corporation and its stockholders for money damages except for liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and
	is material to the cause of action. The Companys charter contains such a provision that eliminates such liability to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law.




	The MGCL requires a Maryland corporation (unless its charter provides otherwise, which the Companys charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or
	otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made or threatened to be made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to indemnify its present and former directors and
	officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or are threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in
	those or other capacities unless it is established that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and:






	 





	 




	




	 





	was committed in bad faith; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.







	However, under the MGCL, a Maryland corporation may not indemnify a director or officer for an adverse judgment in a suit
	by or on behalf of the corporation or if the director or officer was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, unless in either case a court orders indemnification and then only for expenses.




	In addition, the MGCL permits a Maryland corporation to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon the corporations
	receipt of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for
	indemnification by the corporation; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	a written undertaking by the director or officer or on his or her behalf to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the corporation if it is ultimately
	determined that he or she did not meet the standard of conduct.







	 




	43







	Table of Contents




	The Companys charter and bylaws obligate the Company, to the fullest extent permitted
	by Maryland law in effect from time to time, to indemnify and to pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding without requiring a preliminary determination of the individuals ultimate entitlement to
	indemnification to:



	 





	 




	




	 





	any present or former director or officer who is made or threatened to be made a party to the proceeding by reason of his or her service in that
	capacity; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	any individual who, while a director or officer of the Company and at the Companys request, serves or has served as a director, officer, partner,
	member, manager or trustee of another corporation, real estate investment trust, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or any other enterprise and who is made or threatened to be made a party to the
	proceeding by reason of his or her service in that capacity.







	The Companys charter and bylaws also
	permit it, with the approval of the Companys board of directors, to indemnify and advance expenses to any person who served a predecessor of the Company in any of the capacities described above and to any employee or agent of the Company or a
	predecessor of the Company.




	The partnership agreement of our operating partnership also provides that the Company, as general
	partner, and the Companys directors, officers and employees, officers and employees as well as any of the Companys designees are indemnified against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities (whether joint or several), expenses
	(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal, administrative or
	investigative, that relate to the operations of our operating partnership, except (1) if the act or omission of such person was material to the matter giving rise to the action and either was committed in bad faith or was the result of active
	and deliberate dishonesty, (2) for any transaction for which such person received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services or otherwise, in violation or breach of any provision of the partnership agreement, or (3) in the
	case of a criminal proceeding, if the person had reasonable cause to believe the act or omission was unlawful. Our operating partnership must also pay or reimburse the reasonable expenses of any such person upon its receipt of a written affirmation
	of the persons good faith belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification has been met and a written undertaking to repay any amounts paid or advanced if it is ultimately determined that the person did not meet the standard
	of conduct for indemnification. Our operating partnership will not indemnify or advance funds to any person with respect to any action initiated by the person seeking indemnification (other than an action to enforce such persons right to
	indemnification under the partnership agreement) without the Companys approval or if the person is found to be liable to our operating partnership on any portion of any claim in the action. See Description of the Partnership Agreement of
	Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P.Exculpation and Indemnification.




	Insofar as the foregoing provisions permit
	indemnification of directors, officers or persons controlling us for liability arising under the Securities Act, we have been informed that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, this indemnification is against public policy as
	expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.





	Indemnification Agreements





	The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with each of its executive officers and directors as described in
	ManagementLimitation of Liability and Indemnification.





	Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer of the Companys
	Stock





	The Companys charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of the Companys stock that are
	intended to assist the Company in continuing to qualify as a REIT. Subject to certain exceptions, the Companys charter provides that no person or entity may beneficially own, or be deemed to own by virtue of the applicable

	Table of Contents




	constructive ownership provisions of the Code, more than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of the outstanding shares of the Companys common stock or of
	the Companys series B preferred stock, or 9.8% (in value) of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of the Companys capital stock. For more information regarding these and other restrictions on the ownership
	and transfer of the Companys stock imposed by the Companys charter and the remedies for a violation of such restrictions, see Description of Common StockRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer, and Description of
	Preferred StockRestrictions on Ownership and Transfer and Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer.





	REIT
	Qualification





	The Companys charter provides that the Companys board of directors may revoke or otherwise
	terminate the Companys REIT election, without approval of the Companys stockholders, if it determines that it is no longer in the Companys best interest to continue to be qualified as a REIT.

	FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS





	The following is a general summary of certain material U.S. federal income tax considerations regarding the Companys election to be
	taxed as a REIT, the exercise of redemption rights with respect to the common units, and the acquisition, ownership or disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities. Supplemental U.S. federal income tax
	considerations relevant to the ownership of the securities offered by this prospectus may be provided in the prospectus supplement that relates to those securities. For purposes of this discussion, references to we, our and
	us mean only the Company and do not include any of its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated. This summary is for general information only and is not tax advice. The information in this summary is based on:

	case, as of the date of this prospectus. In addition, the administrative interpretations and practices of the IRS include its practices and policies as expressed in private letter rulings that are not binding on the IRS except with respect to the
	particular taxpayers who requested and received those rulings. Future legislation, Treasury Regulations, administrative interpretations and practices and/or court decisions may adversely affect the tax considerations contained in this discussion.
	Any such change could apply retroactively to transactions preceding the date of the change. We have not requested and do not intend to request a ruling from the IRS that we qualify as a REIT, and the statements in this prospectus are not binding on
	the IRS or any court. Thus, we can provide no assurance that the tax considerations contained in this discussion will not be challenged by the IRS or will be sustained by a court if challenged by the IRS. This summary does not discuss any state,
	local or non-U.S. tax consequences associated with the exercise of redemption rights with respect to the common units, the acquisition, ownership, or disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities, or our

	Tax Consequences of the Exercise of Redemption Rights





	If you are a holder
	of common units and you exercise your right to require our operating partnership to redeem all or part of your common units, and we elect to acquire some or all of your common units in exchange for our common stock, the exchange will be a taxable
	transaction. You generally will recognize gain in an amount equal to the value of the common stock received, plus the amount of liabilities of our operating partnership allocable to your common units being acquired, less your tax basis in those
	units. The recognition of any loss is subject to a number of limitations set forth in the Code. The character of any gain or loss as capital or ordinary, or any gain as recapture gain under Section 1250 of the Code, will depend on the nature of
	the assets of our operating partnership at the time of the exchange. The tax treatment of any redemption of your units by our operating partnership for cash may be similar, depending on your circumstances.

	Taxation of Our Company







	General






	We elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through
	860 of the Code commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code commencing with our taxable year
	ended December 31, 2010, and we intend to continue to be organized and operate in this manner. However, qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, including
	through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we have been organized and have operated, or will continue to be organized and operate, in
	a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT. See Failure to Qualify.




	The sections of the Code
	and the corresponding Treasury Regulations that relate to qualification and taxation as a REIT are highly technical and complex. The following discussion sets forth certain material aspects of the sections of the Code that govern the federal income
	tax treatment of a REIT and its stockholders. This summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions, Treasury Regulations promulgated under the Code, and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof.




	Latham & Watkins LLP has acted as our tax counsel in connection with this prospectus and our election to be taxed as a REIT.
	Latham & Watkins LLP has rendered an opinion to us to the effect that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2010, we have been organized and have operated in conformity with the requirements for qualification and
	taxation as a REIT under the Code, and our proposed method of operation will enable us to continue to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code. It must be emphasized that this opinion was based on various
	assumptions and representations as to factual matters, including representations made by us in a factual certificate provided by one of our officers. In addition, this opinion was based upon our factual representations set forth in this prospectus.
	Moreover, our qualification and taxation as a REIT depend upon our ability to meet the various qualification tests imposed under the Code, which are discussed below, including through actual annual operating results, asset composition, distribution
	levels and diversity of stock ownership, the results of which have not been and will not be reviewed by Latham & Watkins LLP. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that our actual results of operation for any particular taxable year will
	satisfy those requirements. Further, the anticipated federal income tax treatment described in this discussion may be changed, perhaps retroactively, by legislative, administrative or judicial action at any time. Latham & Watkins LLP has no
	obligation to update its opinion subsequent to the date of such opinion.




	Provided we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we
	generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on our REIT taxable income that is currently distributed to our stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that ordinarily results from
	investment in a C corporation. A C corporation is a corporation that generally is required to pay tax at the corporate level. Double taxation means taxation once at the corporate level when income is earned and once again at the stockholder level
	when the income is distributed. We will, however, be required to pay federal income tax as follows:



	 





	 




	




	 





	First, we will be required to pay tax at regular corporate rates on any undistributed REIT taxable income, including undistributed net capital gains.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Second, we may be required to pay the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference under some circumstances.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Third, if we have (1) net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in
	the ordinary course of business or (2) other nonqualifying income from foreclosure property, we will be required to pay tax at the highest corporate rate on this income. To the extent that income from foreclosure property is otherwise
	qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test, this tax is not applicable. Subject to certain other requirements, foreclosure property generally is defined as property we acquired through foreclosure or after a default on a loan
	secured by the property or a lease of the property.







	 




	47







	Table of Contents






	 




	




	 





	Fourth, we will be required to pay a 100% tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. Prohibited transactions are, in general, sales or other
	taxable dispositions of property, other than foreclosure property, held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Fifth, if we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test, as described below, but have otherwise maintained our
	qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be required to pay a tax equal to (1) the greater of (A) the amount by which we fail to satisfy the 75% gross income test and (B) the amount by which we fail
	to satisfy the 95% gross income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Sixth, if we fail to satisfy any of the asset tests (other than a

	de minimis

	failure of the 5% or 10% asset test), as described below, due to
	reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, and we nonetheless maintain our REIT qualification because of specified cure provisions, we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied
	by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets that caused us to fail such test.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Seventh, if we fail to satisfy any provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT (other than a violation of the gross
	income tests or certain violations of the asset tests, as described below) and the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, we may retain our REIT qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of $50,000 for each
	such failure.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Eighth, we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of (1) 85% of
	our ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our capital gain net income for the year, and (3) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Ninth, if we acquire any asset from a corporation that is or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is less than the
	fair market value of the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset, and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the ten-year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the
	asset, then we will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of (1) the fair market value of the asset over (2) our adjusted basis in the asset, in each case determined as of
	the date on which we acquired the asset. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of gain assume that the C corporation will refrain from making an election to receive different treatment under applicable Treasury
	Regulations on its tax return for the year in which we acquire the asset from the C corporation. The IRS has issued Treasury Regulations that generally exclude from the application of this built-in gains tax any gain from the sale of property
	acquired in an exchange under Section 1031 (a like-kind exchange) or Section 1033 (an involuntary conversion) of the Code.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Tenth, our subsidiaries that are C corporations, including our taxable REIT subsidiaries, generally will be required to pay federal
	corporate income tax on their earnings.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Eleventh, we will be required to pay a 100% tax on any redetermined rents, redetermined deductions or excess
	interest. See Penalty Tax. In general, redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours. Redetermined deductions
	and excess interest generally represent amounts that are deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arms length negotiations.






	 





	 




	




	 





	Twelfth, we may elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain. In that case, a stockholder would include its proportionate share of our
	undistributed net capital gain (to the extent we make a timely designation of such gain to the stockholder) in its income, would be deemed to have paid the tax that we paid on such gain, and would be allowed a credit for its proportionate share of
	the tax deemed to have been paid, and an adjustment would be made to increase the basis of the stockholder in our capital stock.

	Table of Contents





	Requirements for Qualification as a REIT

	. The Code defines a REIT as a corporation,
	trust or association:



	 





	 




	(1)




	that is managed by one or more trustees or directors;





	 





	 




	(2)




	that issues transferable shares or transferable certificates to evidence its beneficial ownership;





	 





	 




	(3)




	that would be taxable as a domestic corporation, but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code;





	 





	 




	(4)




	that is not a financial institution or an insurance company within the meaning of certain provisions of the Code;





	 





	 




	(5)




	that is beneficially owned by 100 or more persons;





	 





	 




	(6)




	not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals, including certain specified entities,
	during the last half of each taxable year; and





	 





	 




	(7)




	that meets other tests, described below, regarding the nature of its income and assets and the amount of its distributions.






	The Code provides that conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (5) must
	be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. Conditions (5) and (6) do not apply until after the first taxable year for which an election is made
	to be taxed as a REIT. For purposes of condition (6), the term individual includes a supplemental unemployment compensation benefit plan, a private foundation or a portion of a trust permanently set aside or used exclusively for
	charitable purposes, but generally does not include a qualified pension plan or profit sharing trust.




	We believe that we have
	been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us, and will continue to allow us, to satisfy conditions (1) through (7) inclusive, during the relevant time periods. In addition, our charter provides for restrictions
	regarding ownership and transfer of our shares that are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above. A description of the share ownership and transfer restrictions relating
	to our outstanding capital stock is contained in the discussion in this prospectus under the heading Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer. These restrictions, however, may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the
	share ownership requirements described in conditions (5) and (6) above. If we fail to satisfy these share ownership requirements, except as provided in the next sentence, our status as a REIT will terminate. If, however, we comply with the
	rules contained in applicable Treasury Regulations that require us to ascertain the actual ownership of our shares and we do not know, or would not have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that we failed to meet the requirement
	described in condition (6) above, we will be treated as having met this requirement. See Failure to Qualify.




	In addition, we may not maintain our status as a REIT unless our taxable year is the calendar year. We have and will continue to have a calendar taxable year.





	Ownership of Interests in Partnerships, Limited Liability Companies and Qualified REIT Subsidiaries

	. In the case of a REIT that is
	a partner in a partnership or a member in a limited liability company treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Treasury Regulations provide that the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership
	or limited liability company, as the case may be, based on its interest in partnership capital, subject to special rules relating to the 10% asset test described below. Also, the REIT will be deemed to be entitled to its proportionate share of the
	income of that entity. The assets and gross income of the partnership or limited liability company retain the same character in the hands of the REIT for purposes of Section 856 of the Code, including satisfying the gross income tests and the
	asset tests. Thus, our pro rata share of the assets and items of income of our operating partnership, including our operating partnerships share of these items of any partnership or limited liability company treated as a partnership or
	disregarded entity




	 




	49







	Table of Contents




	for federal income tax purposes in which it owns an interest, is treated as our assets and items of income for purposes of applying the requirements described in this discussion, including the
	gross income and asset tests described below. A brief summary of the rules governing the federal income taxation of partnerships and limited liability companies is set forth below in Tax Aspects of Our Operating Partnership, the
	Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies.




	We have control of our operating partnership and the
	subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies and intend to operate them in a manner consistent with the requirements for our qualification as a REIT. If we become a limited partner or non-managing member in any partnership or limited
	liability company and such entity takes or expects to take actions that could jeopardize our status as a REIT or require us to pay tax, we may be forced to dispose of our interest in such entity. In addition, it is possible that a partnership or
	limited liability company could take an action which could cause us to fail a gross income or asset test, and that we would not become aware of such action in time to dispose of our interest in the partnership or limited liability company or take
	other corrective action on a timely basis. In that case, we could fail to qualify as a REIT unless we were entitled to relief, as described below.




	We may from time to time own and operate certain properties through subsidiaries that we intend to be treated as qualified REIT subsidiaries under the Code. A corporation will qualify as our
	qualified REIT subsidiary if we own 100% of the corporations outstanding stock and do not elect with the subsidiary to treat it as a taxable REIT subsidiary, as described below. A qualified REIT subsidiary is not treated as a
	separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of a qualified REIT subsidiary are treated as assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the parent REIT for
	all purposes under the Code, including all REIT qualification tests. Thus, in applying the federal tax requirements described in this discussion, any qualified REIT subsidiaries we own are ignored, and all assets, liabilities and items of income,
	gain, loss, deduction and credit of such corporations are treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit. A qualified REIT subsidiary is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the stock of a
	qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions on ownership of securities, as described below under Asset Tests.





	Ownership of Interests in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries

	. We currently own an interest in one taxable REIT subsidiary and may acquire securities in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A
	taxable REIT subsidiary is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary owns more than
	35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a
	taxable REIT subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In
	addition, a taxable REIT subsidiary may be prevented from deducting interest on debt funded directly or indirectly by its parent REIT if certain tests regarding the taxable REIT subsidiarys debt to equity ratio and interest expense are not
	satisfied. A REITs ownership of securities of a taxable REIT subsidiary is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset test described below. See Asset Tests.





	Ownership of Interests in Subsidiary REITs

	. We own and may acquire direct or indirect interests in one or more entities that have elected or will elect to be taxed as REITs under the Code (each, a
	Subsidiary REIT). A Subsidiary REIT is subject to the various REIT qualification requirements and other limitations described herein that are applicable to us. If a Subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, then (i) that
	Subsidiary REIT would become subject to federal income tax, (ii) shares in such Subsidiary REIT would cease to be qualifying assets for purposes of the asset tests applicable to REITs, and (iii) it is possible that we would fail certain of
	the asset tests applicable to REITs, in which event we would fail to qualify as a REIT unless we could avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.

	Income Tests






	We must satisfy two gross income requirements annually to maintain our qualification as a REIT. First, in each taxable year we must derive directly or indirectly at least 75% of our gross income
	(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain hedging transactions, and certain foreign currency gains) from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property, including rents from real property,
	dividends from other REITs and, in certain circumstances, interest, or certain types of temporary investments. Second, in each taxable year we must derive at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions, certain
	hedging transactions, and certain foreign currency gains) from the real property investments described above or dividends, interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, or any combination of the foregoing. For these
	purposes, the term interest generally does not include any amount received or accrued, directly or indirectly, if the determination of all or some of the amount depends in any way on the income or profits of any person. However, an
	amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term interest solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.




	Rents we receive from a tenant will qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income
	requirements for a REIT described above only if all of the following conditions are met:



	 





	 




	




	 





	The amount of rent is not based in any way on the income or profits of any person. However, an amount we receive or accrue generally will not be
	excluded from the term rents from real property solely because it is based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Neither we nor an actual or constructive owner of 10% or more of our capital stock actually or constructively owns 10% or more of the interests in the
	assets or net profits of a non-corporate tenant, or, if the tenant is a corporation, 10% or more of the voting power or value of all classes of stock of the tenant. Rents we receive from such a tenant that is a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours,
	however, will not be excluded from the definition of rents from real property as a result of this condition if at least 90% of the space at the property to which the rents relate is leased to third parties, and the rents paid by the
	taxable REIT subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by our other tenants for comparable space. Whether rents paid by a taxable REIT subsidiary are substantially comparable to rents paid by other tenants is determined at the time the
	lease with the taxable REIT subsidiary is entered into, extended, and modified, if such modification increases the rents due under such lease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if a lease with a controlled taxable REIT subsidiary
	is modified and such modification results in an increase in the rents payable by such taxable REIT subsidiary, any such increase will not qualify as rents from real property. For purposes of this rule, a controlled taxable REIT
	subsidiary is a taxable REIT subsidiary in which the parent REIT owns stock possessing more than 50% of the voting power or more than 50% of the total value of the outstanding stock of such taxable REIT subsidiary. We currently lease space to
	wholly owned subsidiaries of our taxable REIT subsidiary at our media and entertainment properties and may, from time to time, enter into additional leases with one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. To the extent any rent from such lease does not
	satisfy the 90% rental exception described above, our receipt of such rent will not qualify under the gross income tests;






	 





	 




	




	 





	Rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a lease of real property, is not greater than 15% of the total rent received under
	the lease. If this condition is not met, then the portion of the rent attributable to personal property will not qualify as rents from real property. To the extent that rent attributable to personal property, leased in connection with a
	lease of real property, exceeds 15% of the total rent received under the lease, we may transfer a portion of such personal property to a taxable REIT subsidiary. Our taxable REIT subsidiary indirectly owns certain personal property leased to tenants
	at our media and entertainment properties and, from time to time, one or more of our taxable REIT subsidiaries may own personal property leased to tenants at other properties; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	We generally do not operate or manage the property or furnish or render services to our tenants, subject to a 1%

	de minimis

	exception and except
	as provided below. We may, however, perform services that are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of space for occupancy only and are







	 




	51







	Table of Contents






	 





	not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant of the property. Examples of these services include the provision of light, heat, or other utilities, trash removal and general
	maintenance of common areas. In addition, we may employ an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue to provide customary services, or a taxable REIT subsidiary (which may be wholly or partially owned by us) to provide both customary and
	non-customary services to our tenants without causing the rent we receive from those tenants to fail to qualify as rents from real property. Certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our taxable REIT subsidiary (which is our services company)
	provide non-customary services to certain of our tenants at our media and entertainment properties and, from time to time, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries may provide non-customary services to our tenants at these and other properties. Any
	amounts we receive from a taxable REIT subsidiary with respect to the taxable REIT subsidiarys provision of non-customary services will, however, be nonqualifying income under the 75% gross income test and, except to the extent received
	through the payment of dividends, the 95% gross income test.







	We generally do not intend, and as a general
	partner of our operating partnership, do not intend to permit our operating partnership, to take actions we believe will cause us to fail to satisfy the rental conditions described above. However, we may intentionally fail to satisfy some of these
	conditions to the extent we determine, based on the advice of our tax counsel, that the failure will not jeopardize our tax status as a REIT. In addition, with respect to the limitation on the rental of personal property, we have not obtained
	appraisals of the real property and personal property leased to tenants. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not disagree with our determinations of value. Moreover, in connection with granting excepted holder limits to certain
	excepted holders, we have obtained and, in the future, may obtain representations from these entities in order to ensure that we generally will not be deemed to own an interest in any of our tenants, or in the event we are treated as owning such an
	interest as a result of granting such waiver, we will not derive nonqualifying rental income in excess of certain thresholds.




	Some of our leases are in the form of licenses and have terms of less than 30 days (short-term licenses). The treatment of
	rents derived with respect to these short-term licenses for purposes of the gross income tests is not entirely clear. We believe that rents derived with respect to these short-term licenses should qualify as rents from real property for
	purposes of the gross income tests, although there can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a contrary position. If the payments we receive in connection with such short-term licenses do not qualify as rents from real property,
	such payments would not be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests.




	Income we receive that is
	attributable to the rental of parking spaces at the properties generally will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests if certain services provided with respect to the parking spaces are performed by independent
	contractors from whom we derive no revenue, either directly or indirectly, or by a taxable REIT subsidiary, and certain other conditions are met. We believe that the income we receive that is attributable to parking spaces meets these tests and,
	accordingly, will constitute rents from real property for purposes of the gross income tests.




	From time to time, we may enter
	into hedging transactions with respect to one or more of our assets or liabilities. Our hedging activities may include entering into interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, options to purchase these items, and futures and forward contracts. Income
	from a hedging transaction, including gain from the sale or disposition of such a transaction, that is clearly identified as a hedging transaction as specified in the Code will not constitute gross income and thus will be exempt from the 75% and 95%
	gross income tests. The term hedging transaction, as used above, generally means any transaction we enter into in the normal course of our business primarily to manage risk of (1) interest rate changes or fluctuations with respect
	to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets, or (2) currency fluctuations with respect to an item of qualifying income under the 75% or 95% gross income test. To the extent that we do not properly identify such
	transactions as hedges or we hedge with other types of financial instruments, the income from those transactions is not likely to be treated as qualifying income for purposes of the gross income tests. We intend to structure any hedging transactions
	in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.

	Table of Contents




	To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries pay dividends, we generally will derive our
	allocable share of such dividend income through our interest in our operating partnership. Such dividend income will qualify under the 95%, but not the 75%, gross income test.




	We will monitor the amount of the dividend and other income from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and will take actions intended to keep this income, and any other nonqualifying income, within the
	limitations of the gross income tests. Although we expect these actions will be sufficient to prevent a violation of the gross income tests, we cannot guarantee that such actions will in all cases prevent such a violation.




	If we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for
	the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. We generally may make use of the relief provisions if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	following our identification of the failure to meet the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we file a schedule with the IRS setting
	forth each item of our gross income for purposes of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for such taxable year in accordance with Treasury Regulations to be issued; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	our failure to meet these tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.







	It is not possible, however, to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. For
	example, if we fail to satisfy the gross income tests because nonqualifying income that we intentionally accrue or receive exceeds the limits on nonqualifying income, the IRS could conclude that our failure to satisfy the tests was not due to
	reasonable cause. If these relief provisions do not apply to a particular set of circumstances, we will not qualify as a REIT. As discussed above in Taxation of Our CompanyGeneral, even if these relief provisions apply, and
	we retain our status as a REIT, a tax would be imposed with respect to our nonqualifying income. We may not always be able to comply with the gross income tests for REIT qualification despite periodic monitoring of our income.





	Prohibited Transaction Income

	. Any gain that we realize on the sale of property held as inventory or otherwise held primarily for
	sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, including our share of any such gain realized by our operating partnership, either directly or through its subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies, will be treated as income from
	a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. This prohibited transaction income may also adversely affect our ability to satisfy the gross income tests for qualification as a REIT.
	Under existing law, whether property is held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction.
	Our operating partnership intends to hold its properties for investment with a view to long-term appreciation, to engage in the business of




	acquiring, developing and owning its properties and to


	make occasional sales of the
	properties as are consistent with our operating partnerships investment objectives. We do not intend to enter into any sales that are prohibited transactions. However, the IRS may successfully contend that some or all of the sales made by our
	operating partnership or its subsidiary partnerships or limited liability companies are prohibited transactions. We would be required to pay the 100% penalty tax on our allocable share of the gains resulting from any such sales.





	Penalty Tax

	. Any redetermined rents, redetermined deductions or excess interest we generate will be subject to a 100% penalty tax.
	In general, redetermined rents are rents from real property that are overstated as a result of any services furnished to any of our tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours, and redetermined deductions and excess interest represent any amounts
	that are deducted by a taxable REIT subsidiary of ours for amounts paid to us that are in excess of the amounts that would have been deducted based on arms length negotiations. Rents we receive will not constitute redetermined rents if they
	qualify for certain safe harbor provisions contained in the Code.






	Currently, certain wholly owned subsidiaries of our
	taxable REIT subsidiary (which is our services company) provide services to certain of our tenants and pay rent to us and, from time to time, we may enter into




	 




	53







	Table of Contents




	additional leases with our taxable REIT subsidiaries that also provide services to our tenants. We believe we have set, and we intend to set in the future, any fees paid to our taxable REIT
	subsidiaries for such services, and any rent payable to us by our taxable REIT subsidiaries, at arms length rates, although the amounts paid may not satisfy the safe-harbor provisions described above. These determinations are inherently
	factual, and the IRS has broad discretion to assert that amounts paid between related parties should be reallocated to clearly reflect their respective incomes. If the IRS successfully made such an assertion, we would be required to pay a 100%
	penalty tax on the excess of an arms length fee for tenant services over the amount actually paid, or on the excess rents paid to us.






	Asset Tests






	At
	the close of each calendar quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy certain tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets. First, at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets,
	cash, cash items and U.S. government securities. For purposes of this test, the term real estate assets generally means real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) and shares (or
	transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other REITs, as well as any stock or debt instrument attributable to the investment of the proceeds of a stock offering or a public offering of debt with a term of at least five years, but only
	for the one-year period beginning on the date the REIT receives such proceeds.




	Second, not more than 25% of the value of our
	total assets may be represented by securities (including securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test.




	Third, of the investments included in the 25% asset class, and except for investments in other REITs, our qualified REIT subsidiaries and taxable REIT subsidiaries, the value of any one issuers
	securities may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets, and we may not own more than 10% of the total vote or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer except, in the case of the 10% value test, securities satisfying the
	straight debt safe-harbor or securities issued by a partnership that itself would satisfy the 75% income test if it were a REIT. Certain types of securities we may own are disregarded as securities solely for purposes of the 10% value
	test, including, but not limited to, any loan to an individual or an estate, any obligation to pay rents from real property and any security issued by a REIT. In addition, solely for purposes of the 10% value test, the determination of our interest
	in the assets of a partnership or limited liability company in which we own an interest will be based on our proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership or limited liability company, excluding for this purpose certain
	securities described in the Code. From time to time we may own securities (including debt securities) of issuers that do not qualify as a REIT, a qualified REIT subsidiary or a taxable REIT subsidiary. We intend that our ownership of any such
	securities will be structured in a manner that allows us to comply with the asset tests described above.




	Our operating
	partnership currently owns 100% of the securities of a corporation that has elected, together with us, to be treated as our taxable REIT subsidiary. So long as this corporation qualifies as our taxable REIT subsidiary, we will not be subject to the
	5% asset test, the 10% voting securities limitation or the 10% value limitation with respect to our ownership of its securities. We may acquire securities in other taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. We believe that the aggregate value of our
	taxable REIT subsidiary and our other securities (other than those securities which are qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test) has not exceeded, and in the future will not exceed, 25% of the aggregate value of our gross assets.




	No independent appraisals have been obtained to support these conclusions. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
	IRS will not disagree with our determinations of value.




	The asset tests must be satisfied at the close of each calendar
	quarter of our taxable year in which we (directly or through our operating partnership) acquire securities in the applicable issuer, and also at the close of each calendar quarter in which we increase our ownership of securities of such issuer
	(including as a result of




	 




	54







	Table of Contents




	increasing our interest in our operating partnership). For example, our indirect ownership of securities of each issuer will increase as a result of our capital contributions to our operating
	partnership or as limited partners exercise their redemption/exchange rights. Accordingly, after initially meeting the asset tests at the close of any quarter, we will not lose our status as a REIT for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end
	of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values. If we fail to satisfy an asset test because we acquire securities or other property during a quarter (including as a result of an increase in our interest in our operating partnership),
	we may cure this failure by disposing of sufficient nonqualifying assets within 30 days after the close of that quarter. We believe that we have maintained, and we intend to maintain, adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance
	with the asset tests. If we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests within the 30-day cure period, we would cease to qualify as a REIT unless we are eligible for certain relief provisions discussed below.






	Certain relief provisions may be available to us if we discover a failure to satisfy the asset tests described above after the
	30-day cure period. Under these provisions, we will be deemed to have met the 5% and 10% asset tests if the value of our nonqualifying assets (i) does not exceed the lesser of (a) 1% of the total value of our assets at the end of the
	applicable quarter or (b) $10,000,000, and (ii) we dispose of the nonqualifying assets or otherwise satisfy such tests within (a) six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is
	discovered or (b) the period of time prescribed by Treasury Regulations to be issued. For violations of any of the asset tests due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect and that are, in the case of the 5% and 10% asset tests, in
	excess of the

	de minimis

	exception described above, we may avoid disqualification as a REIT after the 30-day cure period by taking steps including (i) the disposition of sufficient nonqualifying assets, or the taking of other actions,
	which allow us to meet the asset tests within (a) six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered or (b) the period of time prescribed by Treasury Regulations to be issued,
	(ii) paying a tax equal to the greater of (a) $50,000 or (b) the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the nonqualifying assets, and (iii) disclosing certain information to the IRS.






	Although we believe we have satisfied the asset tests described above and plan to take steps to ensure that we satisfy
	such tests for any quarter with respect to which retesting is to occur, there can be no assurance that we will always be successful, or will not require a reduction in our operating partnerships overall interest in an issuer (including in a
	taxable REIT subsidiary). If we fail to cure any noncompliance with the asset tests in a timely manner, and the relief provisions described above are not available, we would cease to qualify as a REIT.






	Annual Distribution Requirements






	To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends, other than capital gain dividends, to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to the sum of:



	 





	 




	




	 





	90% of our REIT taxable income; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	90% of our after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property; minus






	 





	 




	




	 





	the excess of the sum of certain items of non-cash income over 5% of our REIT taxable income.







	For these purposes, our REIT taxable income is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital
	gain. In addition, for purposes of this test, non-cash income means income attributable to leveled stepped rents, original issue discount on purchase money debt, cancellation of indebtedness, or a like-kind exchange that is later determined to be
	taxable.




	In addition, our REIT taxable income will be reduced by any taxes we are required to pay on any gain we
	recognize from the disposition of any asset we acquired from a corporation that is or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset, in each case determined as of the date
	on which we acquired the asset, within the ten-year period following our acquisition of such asset.




	 




	55







	Table of Contents




	We generally must pay, or be treated as paying, the distributions described above in the
	taxable year to which they relate. At our election, a distribution will be treated as paid in a taxable year if it is declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such
	declaration, provided such payment is made during the 12-month period following the close of such year. These distributions are treated as received by our stockholders in the year in which paid. This is so even though these distributions relate to
	the prior year for purposes of the 90% distribution requirement. In order to be taken into account for purposes of our distribution requirement, the amount distributed must not be preferential

	i.e.

	, every stockholder of the class of
	stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated other than according to its dividend rights as a class. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our
	net capital gain, or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, as adjusted, we will be required to pay tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. We believe that we have made, and we
	intend to continue to make, timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements and to minimize our corporate tax obligations. In this regard, the partnership agreement of our operating partnership authorizes us, as
	general partner of our operating partnership, to take such steps as may be necessary to cause our operating partnership to distribute to its partners an amount sufficient to permit us to meet these distribution requirements and to minimize our
	corporate tax obligation.




	We expect that our REIT taxable income will be less than our cash flow because of depreciation and
	other non-cash charges included in computing REIT taxable income. Accordingly, we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the distribution requirements described above. However, from time to
	time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet these distribution requirements due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, and the inclusion of income and deduction
	of expenses in determining our taxable income. In addition, we may decide to retain our cash, rather than distribute it, in order to repay debt or for other reasons. If these timing differences occur, we may borrow funds to pay dividends or pay
	dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirements, while preserving our cash.




	Under some circumstances, we may be able to rectify an inadvertent failure to meet the 90% distribution requirement for a year by paying
	deficiency dividends to our stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for dividends paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends, subject
	to the 4% excise tax described below. However, we will be required to pay interest to the IRS based upon the amount of any deduction claimed for deficiency dividends.




	Furthermore, we will be required to pay a 4% excise tax to the extent we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for such year, 95% of our capital gain
	net income for the year and any undistributed taxable income from prior periods. Any ordinary income and net capital gain on which this excise tax is imposed for any year is treated as an amount distributed during that year for purposes of
	calculating such tax.




	For purposes of the 90% distribution requirement and excise tax described above, dividends declared
	during the last three months of the taxable year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date during such period and paid during January of the following year, will be treated as paid by us and received by our stockholders on
	December 31 of the year in which they are declared.






	Like-Kind Exchanges






	We may dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as like-kind exchanges under the Code. Such like-kind exchanges are
	intended to result in the deferral of gain for federal income tax purposes. The failure of any such transaction to qualify as a like-kind exchange could require us to pay federal income tax, possibly including the 100% prohibited transaction tax,
	depending on the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction.

	Failure to Qualify






	If we discover a violation of a provision of the Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT, certain specified cure provisions may be available to us. Except with respect to violations of
	the gross income tests and asset tests (for which the cure provisions are described above), and provided the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, these cure provisions generally impose a $50,000 penalty for each
	violation in lieu of a loss of REIT status. If we fail to satisfy the requirements for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, and the relief provisions do not apply, we will be required to pay tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax,
	on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible by us, and we will not be required to distribute any amounts to our stockholders. As a result,
	we anticipate that our failure to qualify as a REIT would reduce the cash available for distribution by us to our stockholders. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will be taxable as regular corporate
	dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. In such event, corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends-received deduction. In addition, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, may be eligible
	for the preferential tax rates on qualified dividend income. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we would also be ineligible to elect to be treated as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year for which we lose
	our qualification. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to this statutory relief.






	Tax Aspects
	of Our Operating Partnership, the Subsidiary Partnerships and the Limited Liability Companies







	General.

	All of
	our investments are held indirectly through our operating partnership. In addition, our operating partnership holds certain of its investments indirectly through subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies which we believe have been and
	will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes. In general, entities that are treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes are pass-through entities
	which are not required to pay federal income tax. Rather, partners or members of such entities are allocated their shares of the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit of the partnership or limited liability company, and are potentially
	required to pay tax on this income, without regard to whether they receive a distribution from the partnership or limited liability company. We will include in our income our share of these partnership and limited liability company items for
	purposes of the various gross income tests, the computation of our REIT taxable income, and the REIT distribution requirements. Moreover, for purposes of the asset tests, we will include our pro rata share of assets held by our operating
	partnership, including its share of its subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies, based on our capital interests in each such entity. See Taxation of Our Company.





	Entity Classification.

	Our interests in our operating partnership and the subsidiary partnerships and limited liability companies
	involve special tax considerations, including the possibility that the IRS might challenge the status of these entities as partnerships (or disregarded entities). For example, an entity that would otherwise be treated as a partnership for federal
	income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a publicly traded partnership and certain other requirements are met. A partnership or limited liability company would be treated as a publicly traded partnership
	if its interests are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or a substantial equivalent thereof, within the meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations. We do not anticipate that our operating
	partnership or any subsidiary partnership or limited liability company will be treated as a publicly traded partnership that is taxable as a corporation. However, if any such entity were treated as a corporation, it would be required to pay an
	entity-level tax on its income. In this situation, the character of our assets and items of gross income would change and could prevent us from satisfying the REIT asset tests and possibly the REIT income tests. See Taxation of Our
	CompanyAsset Tests and Income Tests. This, in turn, could prevent us from qualifying as a REIT. See Failure to Qualify for a discussion of the effect of our failure to meet these tests. In addition, a
	change in the tax status of our operating partnership or a subsidiary partnership or limited liability company might be treated as a taxable event. If so, we might incur a tax liability without any related cash payment. We believe our operating
	partnership and each of our other partnerships and limited liability companies have been and will continue to be treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for federal income tax purposes.

	Allocations of Income, Gain, Loss and Deduction

	. The operating partnership agreement
	generally provides that allocations of net income will be made first to holders of series A preferred units to the extent of the accrued preferred return on such units and then to us to the extent of the accrued preferred return on our series B
	preferred units. To the extent we issue a new class of preferred stock, we expect to contribute the net proceeds from such issuance to the operating partnership in exchange for a new class of preferred units, which will be entitled to allocations of
	net income in accordance with their terms. Any remaining net income will be allocated to holders of common units. Allocations to holders of common units will generally be made proportionately to all such holders in respect of such units. Certain
	limited partners have guaranteed debt of our operating partnership, indirectly through an agreement to make capital contributions to our operating partnership under limited circumstances. As a result of these guaranties or contribution agreements,
	and notwithstanding the foregoing discussion of allocations of income and loss of our operating partnership to holders of units, such limited partners could under limited circumstances be allocated a disproportionate amount of net loss upon a
	liquidation of our operating partnership, which net loss would have otherwise been allocable to us.






	If an allocation
	of partnership income or loss does not comply with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, the item subject to the allocation will be reallocated in accordance with the partners interests in
	the partnership. This reallocation will be determined by taking into account all of the facts and circumstances relating to the economic arrangement of the partners with respect to such item. Our operating partnerships allocations of taxable
	income and loss are intended to comply with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.





	Tax Allocations With Respect to the Properties

	. Under Section 704(c) of the Code, income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to appreciated or depreciated property that is contributed to a
	partnership in exchange for an interest in the partnership, must be allocated in a manner so that the contributing partner is charged with the unrealized gain or benefits from the unrealized loss associated with the property at the time of the
	contribution. The amount of the unrealized gain or unrealized loss generally is equal to the difference between the fair market value or book value and the adjusted tax basis of the contributed property at the time of contribution, as adjusted from
	time to time. These allocations are solely for federal income tax purposes and do not affect the book capital accounts or other economic or legal arrangements among the partners.






	Our operating partnership may, from time to time, acquire interests in property in exchange for interests in our operating partnership.
	In that case, the tax basis of these property interests generally carries over to the operating partnership, notwithstanding their different book (

	i.e.

	, fair market) value (this difference is referred to as a book-tax difference). The
	partnership agreement requires that income and loss allocations with respect to these properties be made in a manner consistent with Section 704(c) of the Code. Treasury Regulations issued under Section 704(c) of the Code provide
	partnerships with a choice of several methods of accounting for book-tax differences. Depending on the method we choose in connection with any particular contribution, the carryover basis of each of the contributed interests in the properties in the
	hands of our operating partnership (i) will or could cause us to be allocated lower amounts of depreciation deductions for tax purposes than would be allocated to us if any of the contributed properties were to have a tax basis equal to its
	respective fair market value at the time of the contribution and (ii) could cause us to be allocated taxable gain in the event of a sale of such contributed interests or properties in excess of the economic or book income allocated to us as a
	result of such sale, with a corresponding benefit to the other partners in our operating partnership. An allocation described in clause (ii) above might cause us or the other partners to recognize taxable income in excess of cash proceeds in
	the event of a sale or other disposition of property, which might adversely affect our ability to comply with the REIT distribution requirements. See GeneralRequirements for Qualification as a REIT and Annual
	Distribution Requirements.




	Any property acquired by our operating partnership in a taxable transaction will initially
	have a tax basis equal to its fair market value, and Section 704(c) of the Code generally will not apply.

	Federal Income Tax Considerations for Holders of Our Capital Stock and the Operating Partnerships
	Debt Securities





	The following summary describes the principal federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning
	and disposing of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities. This summary assumes you hold shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities as capital assets (generally, property
	held for investment within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code). In addition, in the case of the operating partnerships debt securities, it is limited to persons purchasing such securities for cash at original issue and at their
	original issue price within the meaning of Section 1273 of the Code (

	i.e.

	, the first price at which a substantial amount of the debt securities is sold to the public for cash). This summary does not address all the tax
	consequences that may be relevant to you in light of your particular circumstances. In addition, this discussion does not address the tax consequences relevant to persons who receive special treatment under the federal income tax law, except where
	specifically noted. Holders receiving special treatment include, without limitation:

	advisor concerning the application of federal income tax laws to your particular situation as well as any consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities arising
	under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.




	When we use the term U.S. holder, we mean a
	holder of shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities who, for federal income tax purposes, is:



	 





	 




	




	 





	an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States;

	Table of Contents




	If you are an individual, corporation, estate or trust that holds shares of our capital
	stock or the operating partnerships debt securities and you are not a U.S. holder, you are a non-U.S. holder.




	For purposes of this discussion, a U.S. stockholder is a U.S. holder of our capital stock, and a non-U.S.
	stockholder is a non-U.S. holder of our capital stock.




	If a partnership or other entity treated as a partnership for
	federal income tax purposes holds shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and on the activities of the partnership. Partners
	of partnerships holding shares of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors.






	Taxation of Taxable U.S. Stockholders







	Distributions
	Generally

	. Distributions out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as dividends and, other than with respect to capital gain dividends and certain amounts which have previously been subject to corporate level tax
	discussed below, will be taxable to our taxable U.S. stockholders as ordinary income when actually or constructively received. See Tax Rates below. As long as we qualify as a REIT, these distributions will not be eligible for the
	dividends-received deduction in the case of U.S. stockholders that are corporations or, except to the extent provided in Tax Rates below, the preferential rates on qualified dividend income applicable to non-corporate U.S.
	stockholders, including individuals. For purposes of determining whether distributions to holders of our capital stock are out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, our earnings and profits will be allocated first to our outstanding
	preferred stock and then to our outstanding common stock.






	To the extent that we make distributions on our capital
	stock in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to such stock, these distributions will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to a U.S. stockholder. This treatment will reduce the U.S. stockholders
	adjusted tax basis in such shares of stock by the amount of the distribution, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and in excess of a U.S. stockholders adjusted tax basis in its shares
	will be taxable as capital gain. Such gain will be taxable as long-term capital gain if the shares have been held for more than one year. Dividends we declare in October, November, or December of any year and which are payable to a stockholder of
	record on a specified date in any of these months will be treated as both paid by us and received by the stockholder on December 31 of that year, provided we actually pay the dividend on or before January 31 of the following year. U.S.
	stockholders may not include in their own income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses.




	U.S.
	stockholders that receive taxable stock dividends, including dividends partially payable in our capital stock and partially payable in cash, would be required to include the full amount of the dividend (i.e., the cash and the stock portion) as
	ordinary income (subject to limited exceptions) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for U.S. federal income tax purposes, as described above. The amount of any dividend payable in our capital stock generally is equal to
	the amount of cash that could have been received instead of the capital stock. Depending on the circumstances of a U.S. stockholder, the tax on the distribution may exceed the amount of the distribution received in cash, in which case such U.S.
	stockholder would have to pay the tax using cash from other sources. If a U.S. stockholder sells the capital stock it received in connection with a taxable stock dividend in order to pay this tax and the proceeds of such sale are less than the
	amount required to be included in income with respect to the stock portion of the dividend, such U.S. stockholder could have a capital loss with respect to the stock sale that could not be used to offset such dividend income. A U.S. stockholder that
	receives capital stock pursuant to a distribution generally has a tax basis in such capital stock equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of such capital stock as described above, and has a holding period in such capital
	stock that begins on the day immediately following the payment date for the distribution.

	Table of Contents





	Capital Gain Dividends

	. Dividends that we properly designate as capital gain
	dividends will be taxable to our taxable U.S. stockholders as a gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset held for more than one year, to the extent that such gain does not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year. U.S.
	stockholders that are corporations may, however, be required to treat up to 20% of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income. If we properly designate any portion of a dividend as a capital gain dividend, then, except as otherwise required
	by law, we presently intend to allocate a portion of the total capital gain dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of our capital stock for the year to the holders of each class of our capital stock in proportion to the amount
	that our total dividends, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes, paid or made available to the holders of each such class of our capital stock for the year bears to the total dividends, as determined for U.S. federal income tax
	purposes, paid or made available to holders of all classes of our capital stock for the year.







	Retention of Net
	Capital Gains

	. We may elect to retain, rather than distribute as a capital gain dividend, all or a portion of our net capital gains. If we make this election, we would pay tax on our retained net capital gains. In addition, to the extent we so
	elect, our earnings and profits (determined for federal income tax purposes) would be adjusted accordingly, and a U.S. stockholder generally would:





	 





	 




	




	 





	include its pro rata share of our undistributed net capital gains in computing its long-term capital gains in its return for its taxable year in which
	the last day of our taxable year falls, subject to certain limitations as to the amount that is includable;






	 





	 




	




	 





	be deemed to have paid its share of the capital gains tax imposed on us on the designated amounts included in the U.S. stockholders income as
	long-term capital gain;






	 





	 




	




	 





	receive a credit or refund for the amount of tax deemed paid by it;






	 





	 




	




	 





	increase the adjusted basis of its capital stock by the difference between the amount of includable gains and the tax deemed to have been paid by it;
	and






	 





	 




	




	 





	in the case of a U.S. stockholder that is a corporation, appropriately adjust its earnings and profits for the retained capital gains in accordance
	with Treasury Regulations to be promulgated by the IRS.








	Passive Activity Losses and Investment Interest
	Limitations

	. Distributions we make and gain arising from the sale or exchange by a U.S. stockholder of our shares will not be treated as passive activity income. As a result, U.S. stockholders generally will not be able to apply any
	passive losses against this income or gain. A U.S. stockholder may elect to treat capital gain dividends, capital gains from the disposition of our stock and income designated as qualified dividend income, described in Tax
	Rates below, as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation, but in such case, the stockholder will be taxed at ordinary income rates on such amount. Other distributions made by us, to the extent they do not
	constitute a return of capital, generally will be treated as investment income for purposes of computing the investment interest limitation.







	Dispositions of Our Capital Stock

	. Except as described below under Redemption or Repurchase by Us, if a U.S. stockholder sells or disposes of shares of capital stock, it will
	recognize gain or loss for federal income


	tax purposes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount of cash and the fair market value of any


	property received on the sale or other disposition and the holders adjusted
	basis in the shares. This gain or loss, except as provided below, will be a long-term capital gain or loss if the holder has held such capital stock for more than one year. However, if a U.S. stockholder recognizes a loss upon the sale or other
	disposition of capital stock that it has held for six months or less, after applying certain holding period rules, the loss recognized will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent the U.S. stockholder received distributions from us
	which were required to be treated as long-term capital gains.







	Redemption or Repurchase by Us

	. A redemption or
	repurchase of shares of our capital stock will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a distribution (and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as described above under
	Distributions Generally) unless the redemption






	 




	61







	Table of Contents






	or repurchase satisfies one of the tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares. The redemption or
	repurchase generally will be treated as a sale or exchange if it:





	 





	 




	




	 





	is substantially disproportionate with respect to the U.S. stockholder;






	 





	 




	




	 





	results in a complete termination of the U.S. stockholders stock interest in us; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the U.S. stockholder;







	all within the meaning of Section 302(b) of the Code.




	In determining whether any of these tests have been met, shares of capital stock, including common stock and other equity interests in us, considered to be owned by the U.S. stockholder by reason of
	certain constructive ownership rules set forth in the Code, as well as shares of our capital stock actually owned by the U.S. stockholder, must generally be taken into account. Because the determination as to whether any of the alternative tests of
	Section 302(b) of the Code will be satisfied with respect to the U.S. stockholder depends upon the facts and circumstances at the time that the determination must be made, U.S. stockholders are advised to consult their tax advisors to determine
	such tax treatment.




	If a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is treated as a distribution, the amount of
	the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received. See Distributions Generally above. A U.S. stockholders adjusted tax basis in the redeemed or repurchased shares
	generally will be transferred to the U.S. shareholders remaining shares of our capital stock, if any. If the U.S. stockholder owns no other shares of our capital stock, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related
	person or it may be lost entirely. Proposed Treasury Regulations issued in 2009, if enacted in their current form, would affect the basis recovery rules described above. It is not clear whether these proposed regulations will be enacted in their
	current form or at all. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the federal income tax consequences of a redemption or repurchase of our capital stock.




	If a redemption or repurchase of shares of our capital stock is not treated as a distribution, it will be treated as a taxable sale or
	exchange in the manner described under Dispositions of Our Capital Stock.





	Tax Rates

	. The maximum tax
	rate for non-corporate taxpayers for (1) long-term capital gains, including certain capital gain dividends, is generally 20% (although depending on the characteristics of the assets which produced these gains and on designations
	which we may make, certain capital gain dividends may be taxed at a 25% rate) and (2) qualified dividend income is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend
	income, except to the extent that certain holding period requirements have been met and the REITs dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as its taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject
	to tax at the corporate/REIT level (for example, if the REIT distributed taxable income that it retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). In addition, U.S. stockholders that are corporations may be required to treat up to 20% of some
	capital gain dividends as ordinary income.







	Foreign Accounts.

	Certain payments made to foreign financial
	institutions in respect of accounts of U.S. stockholders at such financial institutions may be subject to withholding at a rate of 30%. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these withholding
	rules on their ownership and disposition of our capital stock. See Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts.

	Table of Contents






	Taxation of Tax-Exempt Stockholders






	Dividend income from us and gain arising upon a sale of our shares generally should not be unrelated business taxable income, or UBTI, to
	a tax-exempt stockholder, except as described below. This income or gain generally will be UBTI, however, if a tax-exempt stockholder holds its shares as debt-financed property within the meaning of the Code. Generally,
	debt-financed property is property the acquisition or holding of which was financed through a borrowing by the tax-exempt stockholder.




	For tax-exempt stockholders that are social clubs, voluntary employee benefit associations, supplemental unemployment benefit trusts, or qualified group legal services plans exempt from federal income
	taxation under Sections 501(c)(7), (c)(9), (c)(17) or (c)(20) of the Code, respectively, income from an investment in our shares will constitute UBTI unless the organization is able to properly claim a deduction for amounts set aside or placed in
	reserve for specific purposes so as to offset the income generated by its investment in our shares. These prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements.




	Notwithstanding the above, however, a portion of the dividends paid by a pension-held REIT may be treated as unrelated
	business taxable income as to certain trusts that hold more than 10%, by value, of the interests in the REIT. A REIT will not be a pension-held REIT if it is able to satisfy the not closely held requirement without relying on
	the look-through exception with respect to certain trusts or if such REIT is not predominantly held by qualified trusts. As a result of restrictions on ownership and transfer of our stock contained in our charter,
	we do not expect to be classified as a pension-held REIT, and as a result, the tax treatment described above should be inapplicable to our stockholders. However, because our common stock and our series B preferred stock are (and, we
	anticipate, will continue to be) publicly traded, we cannot guarantee that this will always be the case.






	Taxation of Non-U.S.
	Stockholders






	The following discussion addresses the rules governing federal income taxation of the acquisition,
	ownership and disposition of our capital stock by non-U.S. stockholders. These rules are complex, and no attempt is made herein to provide more than a brief summary of such rules. Accordingly, the discussion does not address all aspects of federal
	income taxation and does not address state, local or non-U.S. tax consequences that may be relevant to a non-U.S. stockholder in light of its particular circumstances. We urge non-U.S. stockholders to consult their tax advisors to determine the
	impact of federal, state, local and non-U.S. income tax laws on the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares of our capital stock, including any reporting requirements.





	Distributions Generally

	. Distributions (including any taxable stock dividends) that are neither attributable to gains from sales
	or exchanges by us of U.S. real property interests, or USRPIs, nor designated by us as capital gain dividends (except as described below) will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our current or
	accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of federal income tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty, unless the distributions are treated as
	effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. stockholder of a U.S. trade or business. Under certain treaties, however, lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do


	not apply to dividends from a REIT. Certain
	certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied to be exempt from withholding under the effectively connected income exemption. Dividends that are treated as effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business will generally not be
	subject to withholding but will be subject to federal income tax on a net basis at graduated rates, in the same manner as dividends paid to U.S. stockholders are subject to federal income tax. Any such dividends received by a non-U.S. stockholder
	that is a corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate (applicable after deducting federal income taxes paid on such effectively connected income) or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income
	tax treaty.




	 




	63







	Table of Contents




	Except as otherwise provided below, we expect to withhold federal income tax at the rate of
	30% on any distributions made to a non-U.S. stockholder unless:



	 





	(1)




	a lower treaty rate applies and the non-U.S. stockholder files with us an IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or applicable successor form) evidencing eligibility for that
	reduced treaty rate; or





	 





	(2)




	the non-U.S. stockholder files an IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form) with us claiming that the distribution is income effectively connected with the
	non-U.S. stockholders trade or business.






	Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings
	and profits will not be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the stockholders capital stock, but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such stock. To the extent that
	such distributions exceed the non-U.S. stockholders adjusted basis in such capital stock, they will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of such stock, the tax treatment of which is described below. For withholding purposes, we expect
	to treat all distributions as made out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits. However, amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was, in fact, in excess of our current and accumulated
	earnings and profits, provided that certain conditions are met.





	Capital Gain Dividends and Distributions Attributable to a
	Sale or Exchange of U.S. Real Property Interests

	. Distributions to a non-U.S. stockholder that we properly designate as capital gain dividends, other than those arising from the disposition of a USRPI, generally should not be subject to federal
	income taxation, unless:





	 





	(1)




	the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholders U.S. trade or business, in which case the non-U.S.
	stockholder will be subject to the same treatment as U.S. stockholders with respect to such gain, except that a non-U.S. stockholder that is a non-U.S. corporation may also be subject to a branch profits tax of up to 30%, as discussed above; or





	 





	(2)




	the non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions
	are met, in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a 30% tax on the individuals capital gains.






	Pursuant to the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act, which is referred to as FIRPTA, distributions to a non-U.S. stockholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us
	of USRPIs, whether or not designated as capital gain dividends, will cause the non-U.S. stockholder to be treated as recognizing such gain as income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. Non-U.S. stockholders would generally be taxed
	at the same rates applicable to U.S. stockholders, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax. We also will be required to withhold and to remit to the IRS 35% (or 20% to the extent provided in Treasury Regulations) of any distribution to
	non-U.S. stockholders that is designated as a capital gain dividend or, if greater, 35% of any distribution to non-U.S. stockholders that could have been designated as a capital gain dividend. The amount withheld is creditable against the non-U.S.
	stockholders federal income tax liability. However, any distribution with respect to any class of stock that is regularly traded on an established securities market located in the United States is not subject to FIRPTA, and
	therefore, not subject to the 35% U.S. withholding tax described above, if the non-U.S. stockholder did not own more than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution. Instead, such
	distributions will generally be treated as ordinary dividend distributions and subject to withholding in the manner described above with respect to ordinary dividends.





	Retention of Net Capital Gains

	. Although the law is not clear on the matter, it appears that amounts we designate as retained net capital gains in respect of the capital stock held by stockholders
	generally should be treated with respect to non-U.S. stockholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends. Under this approach, the non-U.S. stockholders would be able to offset as a credit against their federal income
	tax liability their proportionate share of the tax that we paid on such retained net capital gains and to receive from the IRS a refund to the extent their proportionate share of such tax that we paid exceeds their actual federal income tax
	liability. If we were to designate any portion of our net capital gain as retained net capital gain, a non-U.S. stockholder should consult its tax advisor regarding the taxation of such retained net capital gain.

	Sale of Our Capital Stock

	. Except as described below under Redemption or
	Repurchase by Us, gain recognized by a non


	-U.S. stockholder upon the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock generally will not be subject to federal income taxation unless such stock constitutes a USRPI. In
	general, stock of a domestic corporation that constitutes a U.S. real property holding corporation, or USRPHC, will constitute a USRPI. We believe that we are a USRPHC. Our capital stock will not, however, constitute a USRPI so long as
	we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. A domestically controlled qualified investment entity includes a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its stock
	is held directly or indirectly by non-U.S. persons. We believe, but cannot guarantee, that we are a domestically controlled qualified investment entity. Because our common stock and our series B preferred stock are (and, we anticipate,
	will continue to be) publicly traded, no assurance can be given that we will continue to be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity.




	Even if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity at the time a non-U.S. stockholder sells our capital stock, gain arising from the sale or other taxable
	disposition by a non-U.S. stockholder of such stock would not be subject to federal income taxation under FIRPTA as a sale of a USRPI if:



	 





	(1)




	such class of stock is regularly traded, as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market (such as the NYSE); and





	 





	(2)




	such non-U.S. stockholder owned, actually and constructively, 5% or less of such class of our stock throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or
	exchange.






	Notwithstanding the foregoing, gain from the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our
	capital stock not otherwise subject to FIRPTA will be taxable to a non-U.S. stockholder if either (a) the investment in our capital stock is treated as effectively connected with the non-U.S. stockholders U.S. trade or business or
	(b) the non-U.S. stockholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions are met. In addition, even if we are a domestically controlled
	qualified investment entity, upon disposition of our capital stock, a non-U.S. stockholder may be treated as having gain from the sale or other taxable disposition of a USRPI if the non-U.S. stockholder (1) disposes of such stock within a
	30-day period preceding the ex-dividend date of a distribution, any portion of which, but for the disposition, would have been treated as gain from the sale or exchange of a USRPI and (2) acquires, or enters into a contract or option to
	acquire, or is deemed to acquire, other shares of that stock during the 61-day period beginning with the first day of the 30-day period described in clause (1), subject to an exception applicable to regularly traded stock if the non-U.S.
	stockholder did not own more than 5% of the stock at any time during the one-year period ending on the date of the distribution described in clause (1).




	If gain on the sale, exchange or other taxable disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, the non-U.S. stockholder would be subject to regular federal income tax with respect
	to such gain in the same manner as a taxable U.S. stockholder (subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals). In addition, if the sale, exchange or other taxable
	disposition of our capital stock were subject to taxation under FIRPTA, and if shares of our capital stock were not regularly traded on an established securities market, the purchaser of such capital stock would generally be required to
	withhold and remit to the IRS 10% of the purchase price.





	Redemption or Repurchase by Us

	. A redemption or repurchase of
	shares of our capital stock will be treated under Section 302 of the Code as a distribution (and taxable as a dividend to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits) unless the redemption or repurchase satisfies one of the
	tests set forth in Section 302(b) of the Code and is therefore treated as a sale or exchange of the redeemed or repurchased shares. See Taxation of Taxable U.S. StockholdersRedemption or Repurchase by Us. If the
	redemption or repurchase of shares is treated as a distribution, the amount of the distribution will be measured by the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received. See Taxation of Non-U.S.
	StockholdersDistributions Generally. If the redemption or repurchase of shares is not treated as a distribution, it will be treated as a taxable sale or exchange in the manner described under Taxation of Non-U.S.
	StockholdersSale of Our Capital Stock.

	Taxation of U.S. Holders of the Operating Partnerships Debt Securities







	Payments of Interest

	. Interest on a debt security generally will be taxable to a U.S. holder as ordinary income at the time such
	interest is received or accrued, in accordance with such U.S. holders method of tax accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.





	Sale or Other Taxable Disposition

	. A U.S. holder will recognize gain or loss on the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security. The amount of such gain
	or loss will generally equal the difference between the amount received for the debt security in cash or other property valued at fair market value (less amounts attributable to any accrued but unpaid interest, which will be taxable as interest to
	the extent not previously included in income) and the U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in the debt security. A U.S. holders adjusted tax basis in a debt security generally will be equal to the amount the U.S. holder paid for the debt
	security. Any gain or loss will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the debt security for more than one year at the time of sale or other taxable disposition. Otherwise, such gain or loss
	will be short-term capital gain or loss. Long-term capital gains recognized by certain non-corporate U.S. holders, including individuals, will be taxable at a reduced rate. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.






	Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of the Operating Partnerships Debt Securities







	Payments of Interest

	. Interest paid on a debt security to a non-U.S. holder that is not effectively connected with the non-U.S.
	holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, or withholding, provided that:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the non-U.S. holder does not, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the operating partnerships capital or profits;






	 





	 




	




	 





	the non-U.S. holder is not a controlled foreign corporation related to the operating partnership through actual or constructive stock ownership; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	either (1) the non-U.S. holder certifies in a statement provided to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it is not a
	U.S. person and provides its name and address; (2) a securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds the debt security on
	behalf of the non-U.S. holder certifies to the applicable withholding agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the financial institution between it and the non-U.S. holder, has received from the non-U.S. holder a statement under penalties of
	perjury that such holder is not a U.S. person and provides a copy of such statement to the applicable withholding agent; or (3) the non-U.S. holder holds its debt security directly through a qualified intermediary (within the
	meaning of applicable Treasury Regulations) and certain conditions are satisfied.







	If a non-U.S. holder does
	not satisfy the requirements above, such non-U.S. holder will be subject to withholding tax of 30%, subject to a reduction in or an exemption from withholding on such interest as a result of an applicable tax treaty. To claim such entitlement, the
	non-U.S. holder must provide the applicable withholding agent with a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E (or other applicable documentation) claiming a reduction in or exemption from withholding tax under the benefit of an income tax
	treaty between the United States and the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.




	If interest paid to
	a non-U.S. holder is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the
	United States to which such interest is attributable), the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS
	Form W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a debt security is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by the non-U.S. holder of a trade or business within the United States.




	 




	66







	Table of Contents




	Any such effectively connected interest generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
	at the regular graduated rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty) on such effectively connected interest, as
	adjusted for certain items.




	The certifications described above must be provided to the applicable withholding agent prior to
	the payment of interest and must be updated periodically. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide the applicable withholding agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced rate under an applicable income tax treaty, may
	obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their entitlement to benefits under any applicable income tax treaty.





	Sale or Other Taxable Disposition

	. A non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain
	realized upon the sale, exchange, redemption, retirement or other taxable disposition of a debt security (such amount excludes any amount allocable to accrued and unpaid interest, which generally will be treated as interest and may be subject to the
	rules discussed above in Taxation of Non-U.S. Holders of the Operating Partnerships Debt SecuritiesPayments of Interest) unless:



	 





	 




	




	 





	the gain is effectively connected with the non-U.S. holders conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an
	applicable income tax treaty, the non-U.S. holder maintains a permanent establishment in the United States to which such gain is attributable); or






	 





	 




	




	 





	the non-U.S. holder is a nonresident alien individual present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the disposition and
	certain other requirements are met.







	Gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be
	subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis at the regular graduated rates. A non-U.S. holder that is a foreign corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable
	income tax treaty) on such effectively connected gain, as adjusted for certain items.




	Gain described in the second bullet
	point above will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not
	considered a resident of the United States), provided the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.




	Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable income tax treaties that may provide for different rules.






	Information Reporting and Backup Withholding







	U.S. Holders

	. A
	U.S. holder may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding when such holder receives payments on our stock or the operating partnerships debt securities or proceeds from the sale or other taxable disposition of such stock or
	debt securities (including a redemption or retirement of a debt security). Certain U.S. holders are exempt from backup withholding, including corporations and certain tax-exempt organizations. A U.S. holder will be subject to backup withholding if
	such holder is not otherwise exempt and such holder:



	 





	 




	




	 





	fails to furnish the holders taxpayer identification number, which for an individual is ordinarily his or her social security number;






	 





	 




	




	 





	furnishes an incorrect taxpayer identification number;






	 





	 




	




	 





	is notified by the IRS that the holder previously failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	fails to certify under penalties of perjury that the holder has furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the IRS has not notified
	the holder that the holder is subject to backup withholding.







	 




	67







	Table of Contents




	Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup
	withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding their
	qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption.





	Non-U.S.
	Holders

	. Payments of dividends on our stock or interest on the operating partnerships debt securities will not be subject to backup withholding, provided the applicable withholding agent does not have actual knowledge or reason to know the
	holder is a U.S. person and the holder either certifies its non-U.S. status, such as by furnishing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN, W-8BEN-E or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. However, information returns are required to be filed with the IRS
	in connection with any dividends on our stock or interest on the operating partnerships debt securities paid to the non-U.S. holder, regardless of whether any tax was actually withheld. In addition, proceeds of the sale or other taxable
	disposition of such stock or debt securities (including a retirement or redemption of a debt security) within the United States or conducted through certain U.S.-related brokers generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information
	reporting, if the applicable withholding agent receives the certification described above and does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person, or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption. Proceeds of a
	disposition of such stock or debt securities conducted through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker generally will not be subject to backup withholding or information reporting.




	Copies of information returns that are filed with the IRS may also be made available under the provisions of an applicable treaty or
	agreement to the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established.




	Backup withholding is
	not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holders U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the
	IRS.






	Medicare Tax on Unearned Income










	Certain U.S. holders that are individuals, estates or trusts are required to pay an additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on stock, interest on debt obligations, and capital gains from the
	sale or other disposition of stock or debt obligations. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of these rules on their ownership and disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt
	securities.






	Additional Withholding Tax on Payments Made to Foreign Accounts












	Withholding taxes may be imposed under Sections 1471 to 1474 of the Code (such Sections commonly referred to as the Foreign Account Tax
	Compliance Act, or FATCA) on certain types of payments made to non-U.S. financial institutions and certain other non-U.S. entities. Specifically, a 30% withholding tax may be imposed on dividends on our capital stock, interest on the operating
	partnerships debt securities, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities, in each case paid to a foreign financial institution or a
	non-financial foreign entity (each as defined in the Code), unless (1) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations, (2) the non-financial foreign entity either certifies it does not
	have any substantial United States owners (as defined in the Code) or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial United States owner, or (3) the foreign financial institution or non-financial foreign entity
	otherwise qualifies for an exemption from these rules. If the payee is a foreign financial institution and is subject to the diligence and reporting requirements in clause (1) above, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Department of
	the Treasury under which it undertakes, among other things, to identify accounts held by certain specified United States persons or United States-owned foreign entities (each as defined in the Code), report certain
	information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on certain payments to non-compliant foreign financial institutions and certain other account holders. Foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement
	with the United States governing FATCA may be subject to different rules.




	 




	68







	Table of Contents




	Under the applicable Treasury Regulations, withholding under FATCA generally applies to
	payments of dividends on our capital stock or interest on the operating partnerships debt securities, and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of such stock or debt securities on or after January 1,
	2017.




	Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application of withholding under FATCA
	to their investment in our capital stock or the operating partnerships debt securities.





	Other Tax Consequences





	State, local and non-U.S. income tax laws may differ substantially from the corresponding federal income tax laws, and this discussion
	does not purport to describe any aspect of the tax laws of any state, local or non-U.S. jurisdiction. You should consult your tax advisor regarding the effect of state, local and non-U.S. tax laws with respect to our tax treatment as a REIT, the
	exercise of redemption rights with respect to the common units, and an investment in our capital stock or our operating partnerships debt securities.

	GLOBAL SECURITIES






	Book-Entry, Delivery and Form





	Unless we indicate differently in a prospectus supplement, the securities initially will be issued in book-entry form and represented by one or more global securities. The global securities will be
	deposited with, or on behalf of, The Depository Trust Company, New York, New York, as depositary, or DTC, and registered in the name of Cede & Co., the nominee of DTC. Unless and until it is exchanged for individual certificates evidencing
	securities under the limited circumstances described below, a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to its nominee or by the nominee to the depositary, or by the depositary or its nominee to a successor
	depositary or to a nominee of the successor depositary.




	DTC has advised us that it is:



	 





	 




	




	 





	a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a banking organization within the meaning of the New York Banking Law;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a member of the Federal Reserve System;






	 





	 




	




	 





	a clearing corporation within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and






	 





	 




	




	 





	a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act.







	DTC holds securities that its participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among its participants of securities
	transactions, such as transfers and pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct
	participants in DTC include securities brokers and dealers, including underwriters, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing
	Corporation, or DTCC. DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries.
	Access to the DTC system is also available to others, which we sometimes refer to as indirect participants, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC
	and its participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.




	Purchases of securities under the DTC system
	must be made by or through direct participants, which will receive a credit for the securities on DTCs records. The ownership interest of the actual purchaser of a security, which we sometimes refer to as a beneficial owner, is in turn
	recorded on the direct and indirect participants records. Beneficial owners of securities will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases. However, beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing
	details of their transactions, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the direct or indirect participants through which they purchased securities. Transfers of ownership interests in global securities are to be accomplished by
	entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the global securities, except under the limited circumstances described below.




	To facilitate subsequent transfers, all global securities deposited by direct participants with DTC will be registered in the
	name of DTCs partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other
	nominee will not change the beneficial ownership of the securities. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities. DTCs records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the securities are
	credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants are responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.

	Table of Contents




	So long as the securities are in book-entry form, you will receive payments and may transfer
	securities only through the facilities of the depositary and its direct and indirect participants. We will maintain an office or agency in the location specified in the prospectus supplement for the applicable securities, where notices and demands
	in respect of the securities may be delivered to us and where certificated securities may be surrendered for payment, registration of transfer or exchange.




	Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct participants, by direct participants to indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will
	be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to time.




	Redemption notices
	will be sent to DTC. If less than all of the securities of a particular series are being redeemed, DTCs practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the securities of such series to be redeemed.




	Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (or such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the securities. Under
	its usual procedures, DTC will mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date. The omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or voting rights of Cede & Co. to those direct participants to whose accounts the securities of
	such series are credited on the record date, identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy.




	So long as securities are
	in book-entry form, we will make payments on those securities to the depositary or its nominee, as the registered owner of such securities, by wire transfer of immediately available funds. If securities are issued in definitive certificated form
	under the limited circumstances described below, we will have the option of making payments by check mailed to the addresses of the persons entitled to payment or by wire transfer to bank accounts in the United States designated in writing to the
	applicable trustee or other designated party at least 15 days before the applicable payment date by the persons entitled to payment, unless a shorter period is satisfactory to the applicable trustee or other designated party.




	Redemption proceeds, distributions and dividend payments on the securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as
	may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTCs practice is to credit direct participants accounts upon DTCs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us on the payment date in accordance with their
	respective holdings shown on DTC records. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered
	in street name. Those payments will be the responsibility of participants and not of DTC or us, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions and dividend
	payments to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC, is our responsibility, disbursement of payments to direct participants is the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of payments to
	the beneficial owners is the responsibility of direct and indirect participants.




	Except under the limited circumstances
	described below, purchasers of securities will not be entitled to have securities registered in their names and will not receive physical delivery of securities. Accordingly, each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of DTC and its
	participants to exercise any rights under the securities.




	The laws of some jurisdictions may require that some purchasers of
	securities take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Those laws may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in securities.




	DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with respect to the securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor

	As noted above, beneficial owners of a particular series of securities generally will not
	receive certificates representing their ownership interests in those securities. However, if:



	 





	 




	




	 





	DTC notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global security or securities representing such series of securities
	or if DTC ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act at a time when it is required to be registered and a successor depositary is not appointed within 90 days of the notification to us or of our becoming aware of DTCs
	ceasing to be so registered, as the case may be;






	 





	 




	




	 





	we determine, in our sole discretion, not to have such securities represented by one or more global securities; or






	 





	 




	




	 





	an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series of securities,







	we will prepare and deliver certificates for such securities in exchange for beneficial interests in the global securities. Any beneficial interest in a
	global security that is exchangeable under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for securities in definitive certificated form registered in the names that the depositary directs. It is expected that these
	directions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities.




	We have obtained the information in this section and elsewhere in this prospectus concerning DTC and DTCs book-entry system from sources that are believed to be reliable, but we take no
	responsibility for the accuracy of this information.
