Restaurant Tablets with Pay at the Table | Buzztime






























































































 
































Restaurant Tablets with Digital Menu and Payment




Buzztime’s tabletop restaurant tablets incorporate a seamless digital menu and payment experience that puts your customers in control and allows for faster table turn rates, simple and secure checkouts and payment, and most importantly, increased customer satisfaction.











 













Digital Menu Flexibility




The Buzztime digital menus are fully customizable:

add your own product descriptions
add-ons
and your brand colors seamlessly

Your customers can easily customize orders, whether choosing gluten-free options or simply requesting the dressing on the side. Provide a large variety and highlight your signature dishes to consistently upsell products and options of your choosing. Customers can always order more rounds of drinks, appetizers, and other items at any time, leading to larger bills per visit with large parties. Digital menus encourage spontaneous purchases, as patrons don’t need to flag down their waiter or waitress to order.







Dynamic menu transitions between complete breakfast, lunch, happy hour, and dinner offerings automatically according to the time of day.
 Backend ordering and payment options allow management to track best-selling items and buying trends, and simplifies targeting relevant promos to specific customers.



Easy to-use interface lets patrons customize their orders. From gluten-free alternatives to dressing on the side, a larger variety of options provide built-in, consistent upselling and enabled promos to the table.






GET BUZZTIME








Accurate orders, higher tips, loyal customers









Group Cart functionality lets parties use more than one tablet to place a collective order.
 “Send to Kitchen” button allows customers to pace out their meals






INSTANT, AUTOMATED PAYMENT




When customers are ready to check out, they can pay conveniently and securely with the Buzztime tablet. They can preset or customize the tip amount for a quick, hassle-free checkout process. Customers can verify their purchases before closing a tab, and swipe their credit cards through the tablet so they don’t have to wait when they’re ready to check out. The touch-screen signature enables manual payment confirmations, and paperless receipts provide an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional receipts.







Order review allows patrons to verify their final bill as soon as they're ready to pay, making for faster table turns.
Preset tip or custom tip options provide a hassle-free gratuity transaction for both patrons and staff members.



Credit card swipe relieves patrons of having to wait to pay their checks by processing cards through the tablet.
 EMV-capable readers leave the card in their possession for extra security against mishandling and fraud.



Touch-screen signature puts a no-fuss, virtual pen at your patron's fingertips for manual payment confirmations.
Paperless receipts are emailed to those who opt-in for instant, ink-free, and environmentally friendly receipts.

NTN Buzztime is a company that produces interactive entertainment across many different platforms. Its most well-known product, simply called Buzztime, and formerly known as the NTN Network, since 1985, broadcasts trivia and other games via broadband over a national network to over 3,800 bars and restaurants in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Operations in the UK were discontinued in 2008.[2] Typically, independently owned bars and restaurants offer Buzztime. It is, however, offered by each outlet of two major U.S. chains, Buffalo Wild Wings and Damon's Grill. It is also carried at limited T.G.I. Friday's and Applebee's locations. Buzztime offers several different kinds of trivia games based on a variety of subjects, including pop culture, entertainment, world history, geography, sports and music, as well as general trivia games with questions in many categories.
NTN Buzztime, Inc. is based in Carlsbad, California. The company was founded as Alroy Industries[3] and formerly went by the name NTN Communications, Inc. from 1985 to 2005.
In January 2008 California-based Buzztime Entertainment filed a legal suit, in the Southern District of California, against Sony Computer Entertainment Europe alleging that Sony had violated several of its trademarks. The suit accused Sony of a "malicious, fraudulent, knowing, wilful, and deliberate" violation of its trademarks. In the suit Buzztime is seeking the recall and destruction of all infringing products and is asking the court for actual damages, punitive damages, legal fees and an order to the US Patent and Trademark Office not to register Sony's pending Buzz trademarks.[4] The case was eventually settled out of court in favor of Sony.[5]

How Buzztime works[edit]




The Playmaker is the wireless device used to play the Buzztime games, which are shown on television screen


Buzztime players use "Playmakers" to answer the questions that are displayed on the television screens. Questions are answered by pressing numbered buttons that correspond to multiple-choice answers. The region on the right side of the Playmaker is known as the "Playzone" and it features a numbered keypad. The row of numbers at the top of the Playmaker can also be used to respond to questions. Players can also log into their account via a personal mobile device and Buzztime Playmaker app, or use a tablet, if provided by the hosting establishment.
After each game, the top 20 individual winners as well as the top 20 establishments on the entire network (based on an average of the five highest scores at that establishment—top six for Showdown) are broadcast in a "Network Rankings" summary for each game. Many teams gather together in their respective establishments to partake in the battle of wits.
Many frequent Buzztime players are enrolled in the "Players Plus" program. Players earn Players Plus points by participating in a game, and can earn additional points by beating a target score that is given before the start of each game. In the past, Buzztime trivia offerings were available over online services such as the now-defunct ImagiNation Network. Now, Buzztime trivia can be found on other platforms, such as an electronic home-system version and a mobile phone version.
In 2004, the company launched the Blast channel that is available to establishments that upgrade to the ITV2 system. (New Buzztime installations use the 2 channel ITV2 system.) This "Channel B" features the games Blackjack, Cutthroat (a form of billiards), Texas hold 'em poker, Shark Attack (similar to hangman) and Crazy Golf, a miniature golf-type game. It also can be used to broadcast some of the QB1 games, allowing the first channel to broadcast the trivia games.
In January 2006, the company renamed the NTN Network "Buzztime." Furthermore, the "Blast" brandname was discontinued. It also launched an expanded players' website, which features more-detailed player statistics and a phpBB-based forum. In 2009 a third "Channel C" all sports trivia channel was added to the system, but only 2 of the 3 channels (Trivia, Games or Sports) can be used simultaneously at a location. The Forum was discontinued in January, 2010 and replaced with a Blog.
Other products[edit]
NTN Buzztime used to produce a variety of wireless paging products, the most common example being a device that vibrates when a food order is ready. The wireless product division was sold in 2006.
NTN Buzztime also once produced and distributed ProHost Seating and Reservations Software for managing door and floor operations in Restaurants, Casinos, Theme Parks, Hotels, in its Arlington, TX office- known as "Software Solutions". Signature customers include Harrah's Entertainment, MGM Mirage, Universal Studios and Hard Rock Cafe. The software solutions division was sold by NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2007 to ESP Digital Media.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1997, a complaint was filed charging NTN for devising an "exit strategy" that would provide certain defendants with millions of dollars of compensation upon their resignation. In 2000, a settlement of $3,250,000 was approved.[6]

NTN Buzztime is a company that produces interactive entertainment across many different platforms. Its most well-known product, simply called Buzztime, and formerly known as the NTN Network, since 1985, broadcasts trivia and other games via broadband over a national network to over 3,800 bars and restaurants in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Operations in the UK were discontinued in 2008.[2] Typically, independently owned bars and restaurants offer Buzztime. It is, however, offered by each outlet of two major U.S. chains, Buffalo Wild Wings and Damon's Grill. It is also carried at limited T.G.I. Friday's and Applebee's locations. Buzztime offers several different kinds of trivia games based on a variety of subjects, including pop culture, entertainment, world history, geography, sports and music, as well as general trivia games with questions in many categories.
NTN Buzztime, Inc. is based in Carlsbad, California. The company was founded as Alroy Industries[3] and formerly went by the name NTN Communications, Inc. from 1985 to 2005.
In January 2008 California-based Buzztime Entertainment filed a legal suit, in the Southern District of California, against Sony Computer Entertainment Europe alleging that Sony had violated several of its trademarks. The suit accused Sony of a "malicious, fraudulent, knowing, wilful, and deliberate" violation of its trademarks. In the suit Buzztime is seeking the recall and destruction of all infringing products and is asking the court for actual damages, punitive damages, legal fees and an order to the US Patent and Trademark Office not to register Sony's pending Buzz trademarks.[4] The case was eventually settled out of court in favor of Sony.[5]

How Buzztime works[edit]




The Playmaker is the wireless device used to play the Buzztime games, which are shown on television screen


Buzztime players use "Playmakers" to answer the questions that are displayed on the television screens. Questions are answered by pressing numbered buttons that correspond to multiple-choice answers. The region on the right side of the Playmaker is known as the "Playzone" and it features a numbered keypad. The row of numbers at the top of the Playmaker can also be used to respond to questions. Players can also log into their account via a personal mobile device and Buzztime Playmaker app, or use a tablet, if provided by the hosting establishment.
After each game, the top 20 individual winners as well as the top 20 establishments on the entire network (based on an average of the five highest scores at that establishment—top six for Showdown) are broadcast in a "Network Rankings" summary for each game. Many teams gather together in their respective establishments to partake in the battle of wits.
Many frequent Buzztime players are enrolled in the "Players Plus" program. Players earn Players Plus points by participating in a game, and can earn additional points by beating a target score that is given before the start of each game. In the past, Buzztime trivia offerings were available over online services such as the now-defunct ImagiNation Network. Now, Buzztime trivia can be found on other platforms, such as an electronic home-system version and a mobile phone version.
In 2004, the company launched the Blast channel that is available to establishments that upgrade to the ITV2 system. (New Buzztime installations use the 2 channel ITV2 system.) This "Channel B" features the games Blackjack, Cutthroat (a form of billiards), Texas hold 'em poker, Shark Attack (similar to hangman) and Crazy Golf, a miniature golf-type game. It also can be used to broadcast some of the QB1 games, allowing the first channel to broadcast the trivia games.
In January 2006, the company renamed the NTN Network "Buzztime." Furthermore, the "Blast" brandname was discontinued. It also launched an expanded players' website, which features more-detailed player statistics and a phpBB-based forum. In 2009 a third "Channel C" all sports trivia channel was added to the system, but only 2 of the 3 channels (Trivia, Games or Sports) can be used simultaneously at a location. The Forum was discontinued in January, 2010 and replaced with a Blog.
Other products[edit]
NTN Buzztime used to produce a variety of wireless paging products, the most common example being a device that vibrates when a food order is ready. The wireless product division was sold in 2006.
NTN Buzztime also once produced and distributed ProHost Seating and Reservations Software for managing door and floor operations in Restaurants, Casinos, Theme Parks, Hotels, in its Arlington, TX office- known as "Software Solutions". Signature customers include Harrah's Entertainment, MGM Mirage, Universal Studios and Hard Rock Cafe. The software solutions division was sold by NTN Buzztime, Inc. in 2007 to ESP Digital Media.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1997, a complaint was filed charging NTN for devising an "exit strategy" that would provide certain defendants with millions of dollars of compensation upon their resignation. In 2000, a settlement of $3,250,000 was approved.[6]

 News provided by
NTN Buzztime, Inc.  
May 03, 2017, 16:05 ET









 Share this article




























































CARLSBAD, Calif., May 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- NTN Buzztime, Inc. (NYSE MKT: NTN) reported financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.








"We are very excited about 2017 as we leverage our unique technology, player base and enhanced guest experience to expand our customers, invest in our technology and grow our distribution channels," said Ram Krishnan, NTN Buzztime CEO. "In March, we achieved a significant milestone winning the Buffalo Wild Wings award to deliver order and pay with EMV functionality where we beat the competition in a head-to-head trial. Also during the quarter, we launched Spaceteam throughout our entire network and it has exceeded expectations with strong engagement and group gaming.  Our plan is to introduce the Buzztime Effect into adjacent vertical markets, which we expect will diversify our revenue streams over time. Combined with our successful equity financings to fund working capital and growth, we are executing our plan to generate long-term shareholder value."
Operational Highlights  

Expanded relationship with Buffalo Wild Wings to include menu, order & EMV functionality. 
Launched Spaceteam, an award-winning multi-player game that creates social engagement between guests at the table, leveraging Buzztime's unique form factor. 
Closed financing, positioning the company to increase shareholder equity to a level that management believes will enable the company to regain NYSE MKT listing compliance. 

Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017 Total revenues were $5.2 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $5.5 million for the first quarter of 2016. The modest decline reflects lower site count, partially offset by increases in other revenues. Direct costs were $1.8 million, down from $2.0 million for the same period in 2016 due to the lower sales-type lease revenues as well as reduced depreciation expense, offset by increased repair expense. Gross margin increased to 65%, up from 63% in the prior year quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.1 million, compared to $4.2 million for the same period in 2016. Net loss, which included non-recurring other income of $750,000, was $90,000, or $0.04 per share, compared to $1.0 million, which included other expense of $154,000, or $0.57 per share, for the first quarter of 2016.  EBITDA was positive at $654,000, up from an EBITDA loss of $138,000 in the same period last year.   
EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP).  Although EBITDA is positive for the first quarter of 2017, EBITDA may not be positive in future quarters. A detailed description and reconciliation of EBITDA and management's reasons for using this measure is set forth at the end of this press release.
Metric Review for the Quarter Ended March 31, 2017The site count was 2,788 venues and, as expected, decreased compared to 2,814 as of December 31, 2016. Management anticipates the net site count will continue to fluctuate. As of March 31, 2017, BEOND platform installations increased to 2,057 locations, or 74% of the installed base, compared to 1,996 locations, or 71% of the installed base, as of December 31, 2016. 
Liquidity Cash and cash equivalents were $6.1 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $5.7 million at December 31, 2016, reflecting $1.6 million of net proceeds raised in an equity offering that closed in March 2017. Working capital, as of March 31, 2017 was $1.1 million compared to $4.0 million as of December 31, 2016. 
Due to an equity raise of approximately $219,000, net of expenses, that closed in April, NTN Buzztime believes it will regain compliance with the NYSE MKT continued listing standard of $6 million in shareholders' equity.  However, NYSE Regulation will need to make such determination, which will then be disclosed publicly.
Conference CallManagement will review the results on a conference call with a live question and answer session today, May 3, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. ET. To access the call, please use passcode 10875098:

Non-GAAP Information
A schedule reconciling the Company's consolidated net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP to EBITDA is included in the supplemental table below. The Company defines EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with GAAP, nor should EBITDA be considered as an alternative to statements of cash flows as a measure of liquidity. EBITDA is included herein because the Company believes it is a measure of operating performance that financial analysts, lenders, investors and other interested parties find to be a useful tool for analyzing companies like Buzztime that carry significant levels of non-cash depreciation and amortization charges in comparison to their net income or loss calculation in accordance with GAAP.
The following table reconciles our net loss per GAAP (in thousands) to EBITDA:
