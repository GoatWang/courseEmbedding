Ouster at AOL, but Where Does Trail End?

BEFORE he came to America Online in 1995, David M. Colburn was a corporate lawyer in Palo Alto, Calif., known for his meticulousness, his aggression and his eccentricity. Commuting from Los Angeles, he shaved once a week, drove a beat-up clunker and slept in a cheap motel. In an office of suits and khakis, he customarily wore cowboy boots with pinstripe suit pants, polo shirts and an earring. He became notorious for screaming and swearing at younger lawyers for offenses like the failure to underline the phrase ''provided, however'' while preparing a contract, lawyers who worked with him said.The same no-holds-barred approach to business helped propel Mr. Colburn's rise at AOL, where he became the chief deal maker, in charge of its business affairs department. It may also have led to his disgrace. Three weeks ago, he was ousted after federal investigators and an internal inquiry by lawyers for AOL Time Warner began looking into the possibility that deals he negotiated may have inappropriately inflated the company's revenue.Now his departure has raised the question of whether investigators will stop at Mr. Colburn or turn their attention to the executives around and above him. It is as yet unclear whether Mr. Colburn concealed financial details from others at America Online. But people who worked with him said he was always more of a builder than an architect, better at details and execution than devising strategy on his own. And at AOL, he collaborated closely with other executives, including those in charge of the company's finances and programming, they said. All signed off on the structure of all his major deals.Mr. Colburn was recruited to AOL by Miles R. Gilburne, a mentor for most of Mr. Colburn's career in the legal world. Mr. Gilburne became AOL's chief corporate strategist, and Mr. Colburn helped him hammer out the details of some of AOL's biggest deals. Robert W. Pittman, the former president of AOL who became chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner, promoted Mr. Colburn to head AOL's business affairs department and supervised his work. J. Michael Kelly signed off on the accounting for all Mr. Colburn's major transactions as the chief financial officer of AOL before it acquired Time Warner and of the combined company afterward.

Each of these executives declined to comment last week on their roles.Some of Mr. Colburn's colleagues at AOL -- and even some who have negotiated against him -- said they felt he had been unfairly singled out, in part because of his sometimes abrasive style. Continue reading the main story

''People turned on him,'' said Dan Borislow, former chief executive of Tel-Save who had sat opposite Mr. Colburn in several negotiations. ''Every single transaction that he did was approved by somebody in finance. David is an excellent, competent person who covers himself very well. And he is a jerk. That is why he is in trouble. If the guy was a nice guy, he wouldn't be in the news.''Mr. Colburn's friends, including some current AOL executives, say he was neither trained as an accountant nor responsible for the company's financial reports, putting him a step removed from potential accounting misdeeds.''David Colburn would not pass an introductory accounting exam,'' said Allan B. Koltin, an old friend who is now a consultant to accounting and law firms. ''He wasn't high enough in the executive ranks to approve the accounting for transactions of any magnitude. What really smells about what AOL is doing is they are trying to say, 'We had one or two bad seeds among us and we have washed our hands of them and now we are clean and pure again.' ''On Aug. 8, AOL Time Warner's top executives asked Mr. Colburn to stop coming to work, and fired him the next day. Company executives said he was asked to leave partly because a tip from an employee had turned up three questionable transactions -- one with WorldCom and two with still-undisclosed companies -- bearing Mr. Colburn's fingerprints. The company said the deals might have overstated its revenue by $49 million over the 18 months ending last March. Lawyers for AOL Time Warner have sealed Mr. Colburn's office to search it for evidence, company executives said.The questionable $49 million that AOL Time Warner has identified is less than 1 percent of the AOL division's annual revenue and, in contrast to companies like Enron or WorldCom, at AOL there is no clear evidence of wrongdoing. But AOL Time Warner is conducting an internal investigation into accounting at its AOL division over the last two years, alongside those by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.Investors are anxious about the investigations in part because AOL has pushed the limits of accounting rules before. In 2000, the company settled an unrelated S.E.C. inquiry by paying a fine and pledging not to violate any securities laws in the future. Securities law experts say such settlements often lead both the S.E.C. and the Justice Department to take a tougher stance the next time a problem occurs.ONE question at issue, people involved with both the S.E.C. and internal inquiries have said, is whether AOL might have overstated its results by trading goods or services with other companies at inflated prices and recording the prices as revenue. The practice is known as round-tripping because money paid out as an expense effectively comes back, recorded as sales and artificially bolstering the top line. It is an especially thorny issue for AOL because the company prided itself on doing reciprocal business -- for example, selling advertising to many of its telecommunications and technology suppliers.

Mr. Colburn, the point man in charge of negotiating advertising sales agreements for AOL, played a crucial role in most of AOL's reciprocal deals, including its transactions with WorldCom. But people who worked with him in the past say his maverick persona did not necessarily extend to his approach to his work.''Here was a really conservative lawyer who knew the law and counseled clients not to take legal risks,'' said Lior Nuchi, a lawyer who worked with Mr. Colburn in the Palo Alto office of Weil, Gotshal & Manges before 1995. ''The other thing I learned about David is he always made himself a strong No. 2. I never saw him as a guy who wanted to be the primary decision maker.''MR. COLBURN spent most of his career as a No. 2 to Mr. Gilburne, who was a close adviser to AOL's chairman, Stephen M. Case. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin Law School, Mr. Colburn began working for Mr. Gilburn at a Los Angeles law firm. When Mr. Gilburne left to start a venture capital firm, Mr. Colburn did his legal work. Then Mr. Colburn followed Mr. Gilburne when he opened a Palo Alto office for Weil, Gotshal and again when he joined AOL.By then, Mr. Colburn had practiced law for about 15 years as an associate, nearly twice as long as it often takes to become a partner. When Mr. Gilburne left for AOL, Mr. Colburn finally had a strong chance to make partner, but he gave it up to follow his mentor, Mr. Nuchi said.At AOL, Mr. Colburn and Mr. Gilburne made an oddly complementary pair, several people who worked with them said. Mr. Gilburne is a broad, strategic thinker with a quiet, professorial demeanor. He is prone to stroking his beard, alluding to Shakespeare and making Delphic comments about the technological future. Mr. Colburn, on the other hand, is as volatile as Mr. Gilburne is sedate. People who worked with them said Mr. Colburn paced conference rooms with bleary eyes and a five o'clock shadow. He was known for wearing Armani suits over black T-shirts depicting cartoon characters. And Mr. Colburn was also as intensely focused on details as his mentor was on the big picture.Mr. Gilburne sometimes joked that his favorite deals were the hardest ones to understand, people who worked with him said, and he worked closely with Mr. Colburn to iron out the structure of AOL's biggest and most esoteric transactions. In November 1998, for example, the two executives shuttled back and forth between the Silicon Valley headquarters of Netscape Communications and Sun Microsystems playing their contemplative good-cop, aggressive bad-cop roles as they worked out a complicated three-way deal for the sale of one company and a partnership with the other. The deal also involved some of the issues now drawing attention from securities regulators.

In one part of the deal, Sun agreed to pay AOL more than $310 million a year as part of a three-year partnership called iPlanet. AOL treated the payments as recurring revenue until last January, when AOL Time Warner announced that the partnership would not continue. In a simultaneous deal, AOL agreed to buy $500 million in computer equipment from Sun at list price, even though companies like AOL usually buy at a discount of more than 30 percent. In turn, Sun agreed to pay AOL $350 million in licensing, marketing and advertising fees, raising the possibility that AOL was effectively getting back some of its expenditures to bolster its own revenue.An AOL Time Warner spokesman declined to comment on specific deals but said the company accounted for the Sun transaction appropriately. A spokeswoman for Sun said it accounted for the deals appropriately.Although Mr. Gilburne recruited Mr. Colburn to AOL, Mr. Pittman beefed up the company's business affairs division and tapped Mr. Colburn to run it. When Mr. Pittman joined America Online in 1996 as president of its America Online Networks division, he quickly set about streamlining its freewheeling management. He introduced a new focus on bottom-line results and increased each executive's accountability, several AOL executives said. He also instilled a rigorous reporting structure, imposing order on fractious fiefs within AOL, and he prided himself on his ability to exhort his employees to greater accomplishments. Those who disappointed him were replaced.

But Mr. Pittman lavishly rewarded executives who did meet their quarterly goals. Mr. Colburn earned enough from AOL stock options to hire 'N Sync and the Dave Matthews Band to perform for the birthday parties of two of his children.At the time, AOL was shifting its business model to selling advertising as well as subscriptions, and Mr. Pittman expanded the business affairs division partly to coordinate the efforts of the company's advertising sales force and the executives who controlled the content on various parts of its service. Analysts and company executives credit Mr. Pittman and Mr. Colburn with orchestrating much of AOL's remarkable success at increasing its advertising revenue during the boom years from 1996 through 1999, partly through Mr. Colburn's bare-knuckled negotiating.Mr. Pittman also championed the idea that it was simply good business for AOL to take equity in its advertisers and sell ads to its suppliers, two-way transactions that became a specialty of Mr. Colburn's business affairs division.In 1996, Mr. Pittman introduced Mr. Colburn to Mr. Borislow, the former chief executive of Tel-Save, which is now called Talk.com. Mr. Pittman had agreed in principle to sell advertising to Tel-Save in exchange for a combination of cash and warrants to buy its stock, AOL's first deal of the kind, then turned the negotiations over to Mr. Colburn to work out. Mr. Colburn managed to wring an upfront payment of $100 million from Mr. Borislow, making him a hero within AOL, and Mr. Pittman trumpeted the victory.The S.E.C. later challenged how AOL accounted for its equity in Tel-Save, forcing AOL to restate its earnings for the last quarter of 1997 downward by $7 million. Harvey L. Pitt, then in private practice and now S.E.C. chairman, represented AOL in settling the matter.After AOL acquired Time Warner, Mr. Pittman again promoted Mr. Colburn, to head of business affairs for the combined company. Executives at the parent company have said that Mr. Pittman personally worked hard supporting Mr. Colburn to push through its major companywide advertising deals, including an agreement to sell advertising from both the AOL division and the Time Warner businesses to WorldCom. In another reciprocal transaction, AOL simultaneously agreed to continue buying telecommunications services from WorldCom, and AOL Time Warner executives have said that a two-way transaction with WorldCom contributed to the questionable $49 million the company discovered.AOL Time Warner executives and Mr. Pittman's friends said, however, that he was seldom personally involved in the details of accounting. One AOL Time Warner executive said the questionable transaction with WorldCom amounted to less than half the $49 million, possibly representing some side deal. Such relatively insignificant sums would be well below Mr. Pittman's review, executives said.MR. KELLY, the chief financial officer of AOL and then AOL Time Warner, was the executive most directly responsible for the accuracy of the company's accounting. He joined AOL in June 1998. The son of an F.B.I. agent, he, like Mr. Colburn, could sometimes be hot-tempered, AOL Time Warner executives said.

AOL Time Warner executives said that it was Mr. Colburn's job to try to do everything possible to post strong results, and it was Mr. Kelly's job to stop him at the limits of accounting rules. Mr. Kelly signed off on all of its major deals and its financial reports until December 2001, when he was demoted to chief operating officer of the AOL division after a burst of anger at a Wall Street analyst.But AOL Time Warner executives noted that Mr. Kelly was no longer chief financial officer for five of the six quarters during which the company has discovered questionable revenue. Executives said Mr. Kelley had instituted a new, stricter program of financial controls at AOL. They added that the internal policing Mr. Kelly initiated helped block a number of creative transactions involving advertising sales. AOL Time Warner executives and friends of Mr. Kelly said he often clashed with Mr. Colburn over business matters. Mr. Pittman was then called in to resolve their disputes.Mr. Kelly's friends add that a chief financial officer is only as good as the information he is given.Last week, with no clear evidence of significant wrongdoing at AOL, lawyers said it was still too soon to assess the wisdom of AOL Time Warner's decision to remove Mr. Colburn. Martin R. Pollner, a defense lawyer who handles white-collar crime cases, said the firing of Mr. Colburn demonstrates that AOL Time Warner is cleaning house. But it may also encourage Mr. Colburn to cooperate with federal investigators looking at AOL.''It sends a signal to the government that this is someone to talk to, and the game of 'let's make a deal' begins,'' Mr. Pollner said.

COLBURN Background 1. My name is David Martin Colburn. I am the Senior Vice President of    Business Affairs for America Online, Inc. ("AOL").     2. I submit this written testimony in the consolidated matter of United States v. Microsoft Corporation. Civ. No. 98-1232, and State or New York et al. v. Microsoft Corporation. Civ. No. 98-1233, in accordance with the Court's Pretrial Order.   My Duties and Responsibilities at AOL 3. I joined AOL in September 1995. At the time, I was the Vice President of    Corporate Development, reporting to Miles Gilburne, who was the Senior Vice   President of Corporate Development. I am currently the Senior Vice President of   Business Affairs, and in that capacity I report to Robert Pittman, AOL's President and   Chief Operating Officer. I have been responsible for the negotiation of many of AOL's   significant contractual relationships since I joined the company. I have also had   primary oversight responsibility for administering and facilitating the implementation of   certain of those contracts.     4. I was the lead negotiator for the various contracts between AOL and    Microsoft during the period 1996 through 1998. I was also the lead negotiator for the   various contracts between AOL and Netscape during that period. Thus, I am familiar   with AOL's goals and interests in negotiating those contractual relationships.    The Business of AOL 5. AOL is a company that is primarily known for providing online services    under the brands America Online and the recently-acquired CompuServe. In   connection with these services, AOL distributes client software (i.e., software that   resides on a customer's computer) through which subscribers to AOL's services, also   known as members, have access to AOL's online content (including e-mail) and to the   Internet. AOL provides a cross-platform software product; its client software can be   used both on Windows-based and Macintosh computers. It is important to AOL that   any software, including a browser, that is used in its client software have cross-platform   capabilities.     6. The AOL Interactive Service currently has in excess of 13 million    subscribers worldwide. The CompuServe Interactive Service, offered by AOL's   CompuServe subsidiary, currently has approximately 2 million subscribers worldwide.   AOL members each day generate over 1 billion web hits and send 34 million e-mails.     7. AOL distributes a browser to its members as part of its client software.    Browsers are software applications that facilitate the viewing of information on the   Internet. AOL adds, or integrates, browsers into its client software to provide its   members with the ability easily to move back and forth between the features of AOL's   online service and the Internet.   Browsers and Desktops 8.	From AOL's perspective, a browser is a software application that is   different from and not a part of the underlying operating system. Browsers are layered  on top of operating systems, and have the ability to act as a platform from which software applications and other programs on the Internet can be launched or driven. Browsers thus provide some of the platform characteristics of an operating system, since they can manage the calls to an operating system, although they are not themselves operating systems. From an application programmer's perspective, browsers can be a platform for which programs can be written, and can provide support across different operating systems.   9.	A "desktop" refers to the first persistent screen typically seen by a  computer user when turning on his or her computer, and to the software which supports  the display and operation of the icons that appear on that screen. By placement of  icons on the desktop, the desktop provider can direct or influence the navigation of a  user to preferred functions and features of the operating system or to particular  application programs or Internet destinations.   AOL's Consideration of Licensing A Third Party Browser 10. Beginning in the 1994 time frame, the Internet became an increasingly    important element of the interactive marketplace. To enhance its members' ability to   use the Internet, AOL needed to provide its members with a browser. In 1994, AOL   purchased a browser company named Booklink and, in early 1995, began to distribute   the Booklink browser to its subscribers as part of AOL's client software.     11. By mid-1995, there were browsers other than Booklink in the marketplace.    Netscape, in particular, had developed a popular browser, known as Navigator.   Netscape's browser was an innovative and widely-used product that had been well  received in the marketplace. As a result, by mid-1995 Netscape had a significant number of users and a strong competitive presence and reputation. At that same time, it was well known that Microsoft was developing a browser (ultimately known as Internet Explorer) for use with its Windows 95 operating system, released in August of that year. Microsoft's browser, however, did not in mid-1995 have the same extensive usage or marketplace position that Netscape enjoyed.   12.	Prior to my arrival at the company in September, 1995, AOL had been  assessing whether to continue to rely exclusively on its Booklink browser or to seek to  license a third party browser. By the time I joined the company, AOL had concluded  that it would require a significant expenditure of resources to improve and upgrade the  Booklink browser to remain competitive with the Netscape browser and with what AOL  believed was likely in the future to be a competitive Microsoft browser. AOL concluded  that, given the difficult and expensive process that would be required to improve and  upgrade Booklink, it was worth exploring the possibility of obtaining a license to  distribute an existing third party browser with AOL's client software.   The Competitive Environment 13. In 1995, Microsoft was, as it is now, the leading supplier of personal    computer operating systems. In August of that year, it launched Windows 95, which   became one of the fastest selling software products in history.     14. In connection with its introduction of Windows 95, Microsoft became a    direct competitor of AOL by launching its own online service known as The Microsoft   Network ("MSN"). Microsoft included MSN code in its Windows 95 operating system,  and placed an MSN icon on the Windows 95 desktop.     15. Because Microsoft was the largest operating system provider, Microsoft    had a potentially decisive strategic advantage in competing against other online service   providers such as AOL through its ability to bundle MSN with the Windows operating   system and to place an MSN icon in a prominent position on the desktop. By August   1995, Microsoft had already begun to include MSN in every copy of Windows 95 that it   shipped, both to personal computer manufacturers (so-called OEMs) and in retail   copies. By doing so, Microsoft was able to ensure that every consumer who purchased   either a new computer or a Windows 95 product at retail had MSN easily available. To   subscribe to the Microsoft online service, a consumer would merely have to click on the   MSN icon that appeared on the desktop when he or she turned on the computer.     16. Because a large majority of the personal computers sold in this country    include the Windows operating system, Microsoft was thus to achieve virtually costless   distribution of MSN to almost every new computer user.     17. By contrast to MSN's virtually cost-free distribution, AOL was forced to    rely on other, more expensive methods of distributing its software. Those methods   included the mailing out of disks or CDs to individual potential subscribers as well as   the distribution of disks and CDs at public events such as sporting events and concerts.   In addition to being more costly than the method used by Microsoft to distribute MSN,   those methods required more effort by the consumer to access AOL than was required   to access MSN. In particular, a consumer who wanted to access the AOL service   would have to take the time to actually load the disc or CD into his or her computer,   install and configure the AOL client software and then access the AOL service.     18. AOL recognized that having its software already loaded on a computer    when it was purchased by a consumer would be a uniquely effective method of   distribution, and that placement of its icon on the desktop would be a uniquely effective   method of promotion and installation. It also recognized that Microsoft's ability to   bundle MSN with its operating system and place an MSN icon on the desktop ensured   that MSN would be immediately available on almost every computer purchased by a   consumer. While AOL sought to obtain a similar form of distribution by entering into   agreements with individual OEMs to have its software preinstalled on their personal   computers, AOL was required to pay acquisition fees, or bounties, to the OEMs for   each new subscriber that AOL obtained in that manner. Microsoft, by contrast, did not   incur such fees when it bundled MSN with its Windows operating systems, and no   single computer manufacturer had the same ubiquitous market position as that held by   the Microsoft operating system.     19. Because of Microsoft's distribution advantages, AOL became very    concerned that the bundling of MSN into the Windows operating system and the   inclusion of an MSN icon on the desktop would put AOL at a severe and unfair   competitive disadvantage to MSN.     20. Moreover, the bundling of MSN with Windows 95 and the inclusion of an    MSN icon on the desktop created a sense in the marketplace that MSN's commercial   success was inevitable, whatever the merits of that service. AOL thus complained   publicly and to the Department of Justice in the summer of 1995 about what it felt was   Microsoft's ability to use its market position in operating systems to gain an unfair advantage in the online services business.   21.	Netscape, on the other hand, had (in 1995) the leading market position in  the browser market. At the time, Netscape was focusing on selling software to end  users, corporations and through partnerships with online and Internet service providers.  It was not at that time a direct competitor to AOL, and that factor, coupled with the  brand name, market position and features of the Netscape browser, made it the  obvious choice for AOL licensing. Indeed, Netscape told AOL that it had no intention of  entering the online services business, but rather planned to license software to other  entities who wanted to enter that business. Those representations were important to  AOL, since AOL believed that it was possible that the Netscape browser could  eventually become a platform comparable in certain respects to an operating system.  Were this to occur, and were the Netscape browser to become as ubiquitous as the  Microsoft operating system, AOL was concerned that such a market position could be  misused to favor affiliated applications, and could create the same kinds of unfair  competitive advantages that AOL was facing with respect to MSN. These concerns  formed the context for the negotiations described below with Netscape and Microsoft in  the latter part of 1995 and early 1996.   AOL's Negotiations With Netscape 22.	AOL entered into active negotiations with Netscape in approximately  October 1995. These negotiations resulted in the Netscape Agreement signed on  March 11, 1996, which created a browser licensing arrangement, a significant aspect of  which was the promise by Netscape to develop, at AOL's request and cost, a componentized browser that AOL could integrate into its client software. (AOL-0003474; AOL-0003240.)   AOL's Negotiations with Microsoft 23. Sometime in late 1995, Microsoft indicated its interest in licensing to AOL    its browser, Internet Explorer. I understood that Microsoft was aware that AOL was   then negotiating with Netscape for a license of the Netscape browser.   (AOL-M-0000163; AOL-M-0000818; AOL-M-0000799.)     24. At some point in AOL's discussion with Microsoft, Microsoft indicated that    it might be willing to consider including AOL in some form in the Windows operating   system.   (AOL-M-0000818.) After substantial discussions, Microsoft offered to put an   "Online Services" folder icon on the desktop, and to include an AOL icon and the code   needed to install AOL's client software in that folder. This offered AOL an opportunity   to achieve a form of distribution and promotion in Windows 95 and on its desktop that,   while not comparable to that accorded to MSN, was nonetheless of immense value to   AOL. The willingness of Microsoft to bundle AOL in some form with the Windows   operating system was a critically important competitive factor that was impossible for   Netscape to match.     25. AOL would not have been willing to negotiate a browser license with    Microsoft had Microsoft not indicated a willingness to bundle and to promote the AOL   client software in some form with Windows. Distribution and promotion on the   Windows desktop was one of AOL's goals -- indeed, the most significant one -- in  negotiating a browser agreement with Microsoft. The value of distribution through and promotion on the Windows desktop was something that Netscape could not provide.     26. As the negotiations with Microsoft and Netscape progressed, there were    four other, less significant considerations in AOL's mind in deciding how to proceed.   First, AOL wanted a browser with the necessary functionality to meet its members'   needs, and to improve its members' experience over that offered by Booklink. Second,   AOL wanted the flexibility of being able to integrate different browsers into its client   software, thus providing its users a choice of browsers.   (AOL-0001131; AOL-0002908;   AOL-0001140; AOL-0002989; AOL-M-0000979; AOL-0002866.)   Third, AOL wanted   the lowest possible cost for a browser. And finally, AOL wanted to ensure that its   browser would remain fully interoperable with the ubiquitous Windows operating   system. Because Microsoft was the leading producer of operating systems as well as a   competitor (through MSN) of AOL, AOL did not want to have any incompatibility   between its products and Microsoft, or any concern in the marketplace that its software   was not fully compatible with Windows.     27. Throughout the negotiations with Microsoft, I was aware that Microsoft    was concerned that AOL might choose instead to complete a deal with Netscape.   Indeed, once Microsoft indicated a willingness to consider desktop placement   somewhere for AOL, I sought in the negotiations to obtain as much prominence as   possible. Microsoft refused to provide placement of an AOL icon on the desktop itself   or to include our software code in its operating system (as it had done with MSN);   however, Microsoft ultimately did agree to provide an AOL icon in the Online Services  Folder (which would reside on the desktop and display a list of Internet access providers when a user clicked on it)     28. During the negotiations, AOL also sought to maintain flexibility in its    browser distribution and promotion. It was AOL's objective to have both Navigator and   Internet Explorer available to its members, allowing them to choose which browser to   use. Microsoft, on the other hand, attempted to secure exclusive distribution and   promotion for Internet Explorer, with no or few exceptions for distribution or promotion   of a competitive browser. AOL ultimately agreed to these restrictions in order to obtain   bundling with Windows and placement in the Online Services Folder. In the end, the   deal struck with Microsoft was a trade-off: AOL obtained a form of bundling with the   Windows 95 operating system and promotion on the Windows 95 desktop, and   Microsoft obtained virtual exclusivity for its browser on AOL, preventing AOL from   providing any significant promotion or distribution of Netscape's Navigator browser.     29. AOL signed its browser agreement with Microsoft on March 12, 1996.    (AOL-0001724.) Pursuant to this agreement, Microsoft licensed Internet Explorer to   AOL, and it became the default browser for use in the AOL client software. The   agreement also provided that the AOL software would be distributed (along with other   online service providers) with Windows 95 and with any subsequent consumer   Windows operating system and also promoted in the Online Services folder. In return,   the agreement provided for virtual exclusivity in favor of Internet Explorer on AOL. AOL   was only permitted to ship another browser when required by a third party provider,   distributor or corporate account, and only after taking all reasonable efforts to cause  the third party to distribute the third party browser on its own; even then, the number of third party browsers that AOL could distribute was limited to less than 15% of AOL's total browser shipments.     30. As a result of the Microsoft agreement, AOL must and does strictly limit    its distribution, promotion and advertising of Netscape Navigator. Microsoft has sought   to strictly enforce these restrictions, and has carefully monitored references to   Navigator or Netscape on the AOL service.     31. AOL was willing to agree to virtual exclusivity with Microsoft -- something    to which AOL would not otherwise have agreed -- because AOL believed that inclusion   in the Windows operating system and on the desktop was essential to mitigate, at least   partially, the adverse competitive effects of Microsoft's bundling of MSN with its   operating system, and because such inclusion had very significant distributional   advantages that could not be obtained in any other way.     32. Thus, AOL was concerned about broader competitive issues in its    negotiations about a browser license, beyond the relative merits of the Microsoft and   Netscape products, in particular, Microsoft (through MSN) was a powerful existing   competitor, seeking what AOL perceived was an unfair competitive advantage through   the bundling of MSN with its operating system. Only Microsoft had the ability to   provide, both for MSN and AOL, essentially ubiquitous distribution through the vehicle   of the Windows operating system. AOL engaged in these negotiations from that   perspective, with its goal to enter into an agreement that met its browser needs and   was overall the most advantageous to AOL and its members.   The Merits of the Two Browsers 33. During the negotiations with Netscape and Microsoft, AOL employees    expressed various views with respect to the merits of the two browsers. Generally   speaking, as I mentioned above, both Navigator and Internet Explorer were viewed   within AOL as comparable and, in any event, superior to AOL's then-existing Booklink   browser.   Netscape had a robust browser that had been tested in the marketplace; it   had more and better features, and was viewed by many as the more important brand in   the Internet space. Microsoft, on the other hand, had a browser that was already   componentized, but which had not been as thoroughly tested and which was not as   robust. During the negotiations with the two companies, each of them promised to fix   the weaknesses that we perceived with their particular browsers. AOL believed that by   the time that AOL was ready to use a browser in its next release of its client software,   the two browsers would be comparable (indeed probably essentially indistinguishable).     34. As I noted above, componentization was important to AOL. AOL wanted    a browser that would connect seamlessly to the AOL software consistent with AOL's   desire to provide an AOL "feel" to its members during their online experience even if   they were using the browser to access the Internet. While both the Netscape and   Microsoft browsers would have required some engineering before they could have   been integrated into the AOL client software, the Microsoft browser was already   componentized. Because it was, AOL could connect it to the AOL software in a   seamless fashion. The Netscape browser, on the other hand, was not yet   componentized, so Netscape would have had to develop such a browser for use by  AOL. In the agreement with Netscape, AOL required that Netscape componentize its browser. At the time it entered into the March 1996 agreement with Netscape, AOL believed that Netscape was capable of creating, and was prepared to create, a componentized browser.   AOL's Relationship With Netscape Following the Microsoft Agreement 35. AOL's relationship with Netscape necessarily has been affected by AOL's    March 1996 and subsequent agreements with Microsoft. Not surprisingly, Netscape did   not complete its development of a componentized browser given the restrictions in the   Microsoft agreement that would have sharply limited AOL's ability to distribute or   promote that browser. Given Microsoft's refusal to allow AOL to give Netscape any   significant distribution and promotion, I understood that Netscape did not want to   expend the resources necessary to develop a componentized browser specifically for   AOL, and AOL did not attempt to enforce that obligation.     36. AOL has nevertheless sought to work with Netscape to the extent    permitted by the Microsoft agreements. While the parties did enter into an agreement   with Netscape for the distribution of AOL's instant messenger e-mail service, known as   "AIM," in October 1997, the restrictions in the Microsoft agreements prevented AOL   from compensating Netscape through distribution or promotion of its browser on the   AOL service. (AOL-0000277.)   AOL's Other Agreements with Microsoft 37.	Since the March 12, 1996 agreement, AOL has entered into several other  agreements with Microsoft. In so doing, AOL has had to take into account the fact that  Microsoft has made various changes in its Windows operating system and desktops that would likely have the effect of diminishing the value to AOL of the terms of the March 1996 agreement, and thus increasing the relative competitive advantages that MSN and Microsoft's other more recent online service offerings enjoy in competition with AOL.     The Promotional Services Agreement38. On October 28, 1996, AOL and Microsoft entered into an additional    promotional agreement for Internet Explorer known as the Promotional Services   Agreement; this agreement was subsequently amended on December 19, 1996.   (AOL-0000135.) (AOL-0000133-0000134.) Pursuant to this agreement, Microsoft   agreed to pay AOL $.25 per member for each member that AOL successfully converted   to Internet Explorer from another browser. In addition, Microsoft agreed to pay AOL   $600,000 if AOL succeeded in converting a substantial portion of its installed base to   Internet Explorer by a certain date. (AOL-0001438.) During these negotiations, I was   told that Microsoft had no limitations on what it could spend to gain market share for   Internet Explorer. (AOL 0002877.)   This agreement added additional obligations for   AOL to exclusively promote the Internet Explorer in particular locations on the AOL   browser, on CD-roms of the AOL client software, and on sales material related to the   AOL 4.0 product.     39. I understood that converting the installed base of AOL users to Internet    Explorer was an important goal for Microsoft.   The Active Desktop Agreement40. AOL entered into the Active Desktop Marketing, Promotion and    Distribution agreement with Microsoft in September 1997. (AOL-0000123.) Release   4.0 of Internet Explorer included a so-called channel bar on the desktop that points to   content and services that were both already available on the computer and that have   links out to the Internet. If a user sought to use one of those links and did not already   have an Internet service provider, the user would automatically be sent to the so-called   Internet Connection Wizard ("ICW"), which takes the user to a referral server that   included promotions for a number of Internet service providers. Because this channel   bar would be present on the desktop, it would make it easier for consumers to reach   certain content and services that were linked to the channel bar, and thus seemed   likely to provide those entities included on the channel bar with a competitive   advantage over those entities that were not included in the channel bar.     41. AOL believed that the practical effect of the active desktop was to reduce    the effectiveness of the Online Services folder by pushing it down to a lower and less   visible level. AOL was concerned that Microsoft's purpose in doing this was at least in   part to dilute the benefits that AOL had bargained for in the March 1996 agreement. At   the time, AOL believed that the channel bar and active desktop would be more   successful than they have been, and believed that since MSN would be immediately   available on the desktop and prominently displayed in the channel bar, it was important   that AOL be included in the channel bar as well. (AOL-0001372; AOL-0001373;   AOL-0000828.)     42. In order to obtain this position in the channel bar, AOL agreed to a variety  of additional restrictions on its ability to promote and distribute certain other browsers, including Navigator. For example, the agreement prohibited AOL from (1) promoting Navigator within AOL Web sites (with a limited exception for paid advertising), and from compensating Netscape for marketing, distributing or promoting AOL content.     The Windows 95 Referral Server Agreement43. In Windows 95, Microsoft introduced the Internet Referral Server ("IRS"),    accessed through the ICW. This placed an icon on the Windows 95 desktop with equal   prominence to the Online Services Folder. If a user clicked on the icon, they would be   directed to the ICW, which would then launch a series of ICW screens to lead a user   through the process of selecting an Internet service provider.     44. AOL and Microsoft negotiated over AOL's inclusion in the Internet    Referral Server, and ultimately signed an agreement in February 1998. (MS98-   0101383.) The agreement secured placement for AOL in the Internet Referral Server   (accessed through the ICW) for Windows 95 (although for various reasons that has not   yet been implemented). AOL was required to pay a per-subscriber bounty to Microsoft   for the right to be included in the IRS.   The Windows 98 ICW Agreement 45.	In Windows 98, when a user first starts a new computer, a welcome  screen appears which includes four links, one of which is to the ICW. That screen will  continue appearing until the user clicks on all four links and completes the tasks related  thereto, or affirmatively prevents the screen from reappearing. As was the case with  Windows 95, the ICW would take the user to a referral server, from which the user  could initiate service with such a provider. The Windows 98 ICW had the effect of further reducing the visibility and value of the Online Services Folder to AOL, since it was interposed before the desktop on which the Online Services Folder resides. In fact, AOL's perception was that one of Microsoft's objectives was to further reduce the distributional protections that AOL had bargained for in March of 1996. For all these reasons, AOL felt that it was even more important to be included as one of the providers in the referral server. This was particularly true because of Microsoft's continuing efforts to promote its own online services businesses, including MSN, on the desktop, and to make it easy for consumers to access them. AOL continued to believe that it needed to have as close to comparable exposure as possible to whatever Microsoft online services Microsoft was seeking to promote.   46.	Because of this concern, AOL entered into the Internet-Sign Up Wizard  Referral Agreement with Microsoft in October 1998. Pursuant to this agreement, AOL  will be one of many Internet service providers included in the ICW, but AOL will have a  slightly different treatment with respect to how a user gets connected to AOL than is the  case for other Internet service providers.   AOL's Present Intentions Regarding Browsers 47.	AOL's March 1996 agreement with Microsoft continues for several years,  but AOL can elect at the end of this year not to continue the exclusivity and Online  Service Folder provisions in the 1996 Microsoft agreement. At this point, Navigator  and Internet Explorer continue to be reasonably comparable browser solutions.  Particularly since Microsoft is a direct and significant competitor to AOL, AOL would be  inclined to license the Netscape browser, at least to provide it as an option to AOL members. Given the importance of continuing to be included in the Windows operating system and desktop, however, AOL's present intention is to opt to continue with the provisions of the 1996 Microsoft agreement, for several reasons. First, Microsoft has demanded that AOL continue with these exclusivity provisions or lose the right of CompuServe to be included in the Online Services Folder and the ICW, and for AOL to continue to be listed in the referral server. Second, Microsoft's increased presence in the browser market has left Netscape, at least at this point, in a weakened state. Third, AOL continues to want to ensure, to the extent possible, that there will be neither real interoperability problems between the Windows operating system and AOL, nor any perception in the marketplace that this could occur.   Conclusion 48.     AOL would not have been willing to negotiate a browser license with Microsoft had Microsoft not been willing to bundle and promote AOL in its Windows operating system and on its desktop. And AOL would not have been prepared to accept the restrictions on its distribution and promotion of Netscape Navigator had Microsoft not insisted on those restrictions as an element of the licensing agreement. While AOL viewed the Netscape and Microsoft browsers as comparable (and in each case an improvement over AOL's Booklink browser), distribution and promotion in the Windows operating systems was something that Netscape simply could not provide.                  _______________/s/________________   David Martin Colburn   WA: 1030525vlPrinted: 10-13-98 21:47

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREMaking Modern Florida: How The Spirit Of Reform Shaped A New State Constitutionby Adkins, Mary E./ Colburn, David R. (Frw)/ Mac Manus, Susan A. (Frw) Adkins portrays a major turning point in the development of modern Florida and has done a great job of bringing to life so many of the people who achieved this massive rewrite of our constitution.  Talbot D Alemberte, former president of the American Bar Association and author of The Florida State Constitution&nbsp; Deftly captures the story of the politics and powerful personalities who created a more modern government structure for Florida.  Neil Skene, former editor and president of Congressional Quarterly, Inc.&nbsp;Mid-twentieth-century Florida was a state in flux. Changes exemplified by rapidly burgeoning cities and suburbs, the growth of the Kennedy Space Center during the space race, and the impending construction of Walt Disney World overwhelmed the outdated 1885 constitution. A small group of rural legislators known as the  Pork Chop Gang  controlled the state and thwarted several attempts to modernize the constitution. Through court-imposed redistribution of legislators and the hard work of state leaders, however, the executive branch was reorganized and the constitution was modernized.In Making Modern Florida, Mary Adkins goes behind the scenes to examine the history and impact of the 1966 68 revision of the Florida state constitution. With storytelling flair, Adkins uses interviews and detailed analysis of speeches and transcripts to vividly capture the moves, gambits, and backroom moments necessary to create and introduce a new state constitution. This carefully researched account brings to light the constitutional debates and political processes in the growth to maturity of what is now the nation's third largest state.&nbsp;20th Century, ConstitutionsCondition: NewHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
