Small Business Insurance for USAA Members







	Small business is our business.


From start-up to established; from zero employees to 10+, every small business needs insurance.
Â 
More than 1,000,000 small businesses have placed their trust in The Hartford.1 Thatâs why USAA3 and The Hartford have partnered to offer insurance solutions that help protect your business so when the unexpected happens, you donât just endure â¦ you prevail.

Whether your small business is just starting out or growing to the next level, you can get flexible coverage to meet your unique needs with The Hartford.
Â 

Learn More About Coverages for USAA Small Business Owners








                          Business Ownerâs Policy (BOP)
                      






Our latest research shows that small business owners view the insurance experience as a balancing act between purchasing coverage thatâs just right â i.e. not too much, not too little â but at a price they can afford. With The Hartford, you can purchase the right amount of coverage for your unique business needs.
Â 
The Hartford offers two critical insurance coverages: business property and business liability in one policy âÂ Business Ownerâs Policy (BOP). This convenient policy can protect your business against fire, theft, lawsuits and more.
Â 
Key optional coverages you should consider:
Â 

	Business Income


		Income loss is the primary reason most businesses do not open after a serious loss

		55% of small businesses report not having business income insurance1

		Provides income for ongoing expenses while your business recovers

		Optional Business Income for Off-Premises Utility Services

		$3,000 a day is the median cost of downtime from a business affected by an extreme weather event2

		Optional coverage includes $25,000 coverage limit and a brief 12-hour waiting period after loss before coverage kicks in



	Data Breach


		1 out of every 3 data breaches investigated in 2012 were from small businesses3

		$188 per breached record was the average cost of a data breach in 20124

		Endorsement includes access to resources to help prevent data breaches and specialized assistance to help if one occurs

Â 
Let The Hartford stand behind your business, call 1-855-829-1682 to talk with an insurance specialist.

                          Workersâ Compensation
                      






Our research shows that there are three things most small business owners worry about when it comes to compensating a disabled employee:
Â 


		The cost to cover expenses

		Navigating the medical and legal system

		Getting their employees healthy and back to work

Â 
With The Hartford, you can purchase coverage that helps you accomplish all three things. Our unique approach to covering injured employees goes beyond the basics and exceeds industry standards:
Â 


		The Hartfordâs Teamâ¢WorkSM program helps gets employees back to work a full week earlier than average â with 50 percent returning within 36 days1

		A broad network of physicians, nurses and pharmacies makes it easier and faster to find quality, trustworthy care

		Outstanding educational tools like eGuides, chalk talks and Loss Prevention solutions help employers learn how to manage costs and help employees prevent injuries before they happen

                          Business Auto Insurance
                      





According to our research, business owners worry about finding the right auto coverage, maintaining their rates over time and avoiding hassles when it comes time to make a claim.
Â 
With The Hartford, you can get the right auto coverage for your business as well as an excellent claims experience if the time comes.
Â 
With business auto coverage from The Hartford, you get:
Â 


		A broad form endorsement âÂ automatically added to every policy at no additional cost â providing critical coverages such as Loan Lease Gap, Hybrid Payment and Electronic Equipment (Existing)

		Accident forgiveness: Fender Bender Forgiveness will eliminate the worry of a small incident driving up rates, and by staying claim free for three years, your next claim will be forgiven

		New discounts for safety features and for use of telematics devices
		Â 

Let The Hartford stand behind your business, callÂ 1-855-829-1682Â to talk with an insurance specialist.

For the first time in more than 20 years I did not receive an auto policy dividend check in the mailÂ this year. Why is that?

						Yes I did not receive one either. If the board didn't approve one why wasn't this at least posted on USAA.com?

Giants fan 22, thank you for yourÂ post and feedback today of notifying those not approved of the insurance dividend.Â  Please keep in mind that dividends are a discretionary return of premium that are not guaranteed.Â  The board of directorsÂ did notÂ approve a dividend for USAA General Indemnity Company (GIC) and Garrison Insurance Company (GAR).Â  Dividends are approved by the board of directors of each company based on the individual and financial performance of each company.Â  It's not only a reflection of the profitability of the automobile insurance product but rather the company as a whole.Â  Your membership is greatly appreciated and well respected.Â  Thanks again for your time.Â  SincerelyÂ  -Â  Justin

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
