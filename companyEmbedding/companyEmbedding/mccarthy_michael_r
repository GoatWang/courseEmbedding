Whenever my parents needed Kim consultation/advice on my case, Kim returned the calls and made herself available as much as she could. In the first meeting with my parents Kimberly discussed the case defense strategy in a lot of detail, explaining and drawing out a time line so we would be prepared. She explained it so my parents could understand how Kim would be handling my cases. The defense strategies were very impressive to my parents and me; they believed Kim will win the immigration deportation case with the wonderful defense strategy. Thanks to her hard work, Kim was finally successful in cancelling the deportation proceedings against me at the Immigration Court. Currently, Kim Trupiano is helping me with some other criminal charges to try to avoid more immigration consequences that would cause me to be deported to Serbia – a country I don’t know at all anymore and where I don’t know anyone and which is away from all of my family here in the United States. I am very happy to recommend attorney Kim Trupiano for whoever needs an experienced criminal and immigration attorney. Kimberly has a lot of experience in both immigration and criminal defense fields; that is what makes it so she can be so successful in immigration cases with criminal history problems. People who have criminal conviction are not always bad people and Kim understands that. Another good thing is Kimberly worked to accommodate the client’s financial capability to pay for legal fees. Kim had worked out a payment plan with a reasonable monthly payment so my parents and I can afford her helping me.Thanks Kim a lot!Emy Cordano, Attorney at LawDebby J. ratedMaybe Emy is the best because she has a perspective from several countries. I was fascinated to know Emy is from south africa, where she saw injustice in families daily. I am just a local woman, never been anywhere other than mexico on vacation or to North Carolina to see my ex-husbands family on a trip so as you can imagine, I haven't seen much hardship here in Utah. I think because of that I didn't know who to turn to, my bishop advised I stay married, so I did for a number of years, unhappily. My ex-husband was mentally abusive, you don't know just how bad it is until you can't leave the house without anxiety and you always doubt yourself and feel terribly about who you are, you hate your reflection. I spoke with Emy and she set me on the path to rediscovering myself. I was able to file divorce and she helped me when my bishop tried to advise me against it. I am still an active member of the church, but I came close to the edge and without Emy holding my hand through the entire ordeal, I may have caved. Emy helped file, finalize and come out a better person from my divorce. I have a home, and can finally get back to finishing my degree and getting a job, something my ex-husband wouldn't let me do. Thank you Emy for saving my life, truly. This isn't me being sappy, it is me being thankful knowing someone was in my corner, for me!   Best wishes to you and yours always, Debby J.Schatz Anderson and Associatesreginaldo.silva ratedTwo years ago today I hired Sc...Two years ago today I hired Schatz, Anderson and Associates.  I hired them out of SLC because I work there, although I live in Cedar City.  Charles Stewart did everything he could to make sure my needs were met and that my concerns with the proceedings were always resolved.  Being in the military this was sensitive case and could have resulted in me losing my security clearance and ultimately my job.  Charles made sure to postpone the hearing long enough to resolve my deployment issues and made sure to push the trial when it needed to be resolved.  Ultimately, I was found NOT GUILTY in front of a Jury Trial.  If you know Cedar City you will understand how hard this is.  Cedar City is a zero tolerance City and the prosecuting attorney would not plea bargain.  Charles drove from SLC for all the hearings and even had a lawyer from St. George that was more familiar with the Cedar City system come in to help smooth things over with the small town locals.  Charles knows all the ins and outs of the DUI legal system.  He was able to break everything down and explain the technicalities of the situation to the jury helping them find me NOT GUILTY.  I am very pleased, and hopefully will never have to go through this again but will make sure to let my friends in Cedar City know about this firm.  Thanks for everything.Liberty Law Grouptimothy.trent.35 rated I highly recommend James, I had him represent me in court to challenge a traffic citation due to a serious collision. Although the violation dictated a judgement against me there were some extenuating circumstances that I felt contributed to the accident that were due to the other drivers neglect and irresponsibility. James was able to convince the prosecutor that the other driver was at fault and the citation was dismissed. I was pretty surprised, I was just hoping for a reduced fine. After the hearing James told me how things played out with the prosecutor and it turned out that there were some circumstances in his meeting with the prosecutor that he was able to take advantage off that swung things in our favor. In other words James knew the system, saw an opportunity and acted on it. I've worked with other attorneys with my divorce and never felt comfortable with them but felt very comfortable working with James and was confident that I was getting the best representation and would have still felt that way if things hadn't worked out as well as they did.Trupiano Law PCyennyp ratedI feel relieved today. It was ...I feel relieved today. It was a long immigration journey I have been going through and finally it was over with the GREAT victory. I hired Kimberly Trupiano representing me in applying for asylum and we got approval from the immigration judge.  The Department of Homeland Security attorney appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals, but Kimberly was also able to win. How amazing!!!! I remained an asylee for a while and USCIS has granted me green card few days ago. Eventually I will be eligible to apply for US citizenship. Thanks Kim and Thanks God! It is no doubt Kimberly is very good handling the toughest immigration cases. She is very knowledgeable, aggressive and has a lot of experience practicing immigration law. She tried her best to get the most positive outcome for my case. I highly recommend Kim for whoever needs a good lawyer. You will be in a good hand. Kim also discounted the legal fees a lot to help me out. She offered me small monthly payments to pay off the case. She really helped me out in the most difficult situation in my life.Law Office of Jonathan MillerRonnie C. ratedWe used the estate planning services of Jonathan Miller in August 2015 to create a family trust. We had not done any estate planning - we didn't know where to begin and were overwhelmed with how much work we thought it would be.Working with Jonathan Miller was the best decision we could have made. He kept the process really simple and tailored it specifically to our needs. We were able to fill out a simple questionnaire before our first meeting so that he had an idea of what we wanted to do. With just a couple of brief office visits and a little information gathering on our own time, we were able to have a trust in place for our family. His price was more than reasonable, and he was up-front with us about what was included. We were pleasantly surprised that the estate planning process wasn't as long and painful as we had anticipated; it was actually very simple to complete. We only wish we had done it sooner. We highly recommend Jonathan Miller for estate planning services.Emy Cordano, Attorney at LawJessic S. ratedEmy helped me keep the roof over my head and that of my children. We had only been married a year but had 3 children together. He didn't cheat, he didn't do anything horrible per se, he simply decided one day not to be married anymore and told me to move out and that I could see my children 50% of the time. I was gobsmacked and turned to Emy for advice. It didn't take long after our first meeting to feel that Emy was on my side. She was very down to Earth, asked a LOT of questions but now I see why, because I got the one thing from the divorce I needed more than child support. I couldn't take my kids out of school, move jobs and find a new home all at once so without Emy I may have found myself homeless, jobless and on the streets! She is worth it! Thank you Emy for a great experience and for a very fast divorce. I hate to say it, to anybody, but if you are thinking about divorce, have kids in the mix, are worried about alimony and child support, please think of Emy. Emy Cordano, Attorney at LawErica L. ratedI was going through the motions of attempting to serve and gain consent from my son's biological father for a name change.  I did all the paperwork on my own but I lost faith when he continued to delay returning the signed consent form back to me.  Emy gave me the courage and tools to stand up to him and let him know that I had her on my side if he delayed another month.  I should note that all I did was an hour consult with Emy.  She provided me her rates if it did end up going to court, but remained confident that I could finish what I started based on her advice.  Emy is a unique lawyer that has a good grasp on the outcomes for family law.  She was compassionate and honest with me and that is greatly appreciated.  I did end up getting the consent form back and was able to change my son's last name to the appropriate one this month.  I couldn't thank her enough and I'm glad I have on my side if anything else should arise and I need an attorney.Trupiano Law PCLily T. ratedI hired Kimberly at Trupiano Law represented me at USCIS and the immigration court. The case was successful closed and I finally became the legal permanent resident. Kimberly is the most aggressive and experienced lawyer I ever met in Salt Lake City. I had some consultations with two lawyers, after that I almost lost the hope in the immigration process to become legal until I found Trupiano Law online. She is very knowledgeable, enthusiastic, and attentive. She always tried her best to come up with the positive outcomes for my case. She was willing to work after hours to accommodate my work schedule in meeting me about the case. She offers the payment plan to help me out financially. I made the great choice in hiring her for this tough immigration matter. I am grateful to her. She and her staff is very professional, friendly and caring in working with me. I would definitely recommend her to anyone needing an immigration lawyer.Berry, David TAnnie B. ratedEight years ago, I got sick and medical bills began piling up. Then our business tanked due to the economy and bad turned to worse.  We had to start paying bills with credit cards; it was downhill from there. Despite our best efforts, bankruptcy became necessary. We ended up going with Berry & Tripp (www.berrytripp.com). David (Dave) Berry is the attorney that helped us through the process and eventually file. Having to file bankruptcy was one of the most difficult and humbling experiences that I do not wish upon anyone. Yet, having Dave as our attorney made the process bearable. He specializes in bankruptcy and truly is an expert in his field. After filing, Dave taught us steps on how to begin rebuilding our credit. The staff at Berry & Tripp was always friendly and helpful. Overall, the bankruptcy was awful but Dave Berry was wonderful. We highly recommend him. Did You Know?Types of AttorneysThe legal profession is vast, with each attorney having his or her specialties. Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
