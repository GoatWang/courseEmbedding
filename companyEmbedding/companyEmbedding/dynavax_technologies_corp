We are committed to utilizing the immune system to prevent and fight disease.
Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with multiple product candidates in development for the prevention of infectious disease, the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, and the treatment of cancer. We develop immunotherapies based on cutting-edge Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) biology and its ability to modulate the immune system.
HBsAg-1018 (HEPLISAV-B™) - Hepatitis B Vaccine
HBsAg-1018 is an adult hepatitis B vaccine in Phase 3 development that utilizes a proprietary TLR9 agonist to elicit a focused immune response designed to provide protection against hepatitis B. We have submitted the Biologics License Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA has established December 15th 2016 as the Prescription Drug User Fee Action date.
SD-101 - Cancer Immunotherapy
We are utilizing our expertise in TLR biology to develop treatments for cancer by focusing the power of the body’s immune response on cancer cells through optimal stimulation of TLR9 signaling. Our lead cancer immunotherapy compound, SD-101, is a TLR9 agonist designed specifically for cancer and capable of maximal type 1 IFN induction and efficient maturation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) to antigen-presenting cells. Our approach provides multiple mechanisms for attacking the tumors along with developing immune memory associated with antigens found in the tumor.
Immune-Mediated Diseases
TLR signaling plays an important role in a variety of immune-mediated diseases including asthma and certain autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Through modulation of TLR signaling we are developing compounds to inhibit stimulation of TLRs that lead to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well using TLR agonist to rebalance the Th1 versus Th2 response in asthma.

					Full Description



Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Dynavax), incorporated on November 6, 2000, is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on leveraging the body's innate and adaptive immune responses through toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation. The Company's product candidates are being investigated for use in multiple cancer indications, as a vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis B and as a disease modifying therapy for asthma. The Company's pipeline of product candidates includes HEPLISAV-B, AZD1419, SD-101, DV281, DV230F and DV1001. DV230F is indicated for the treatment of Liver Tumors. DV1001 targets TLR 7 and 8 agonist for multiple malignancies. DV230F and DV1001 are in pre-clinical stage of development.HEPLISAV-BThe Company's product candidate HEPLISAV-B is an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine. HEPLISAV-B combines 1018, a TLR9 agonist adjuvant, and recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (rHBsAg). HEPLISAV-B is in Phase III of its clinical trials.AZD1419AZD1419 is being developed for the treatment of asthma pursuant to a collaboration with AstraZeneca AB (AstraZeneca). AZD1419 is designed to change the basic immune response to environmental allergens, such as house dust and pollens, leading to prolonged reduction in asthma symptoms by converting the response from one primarily mediated by type-2 helper thymus (T) cells to type-1 helper T cells. AZD1419 is in Phase II of its clinical trials.SD-101SD-101 is an investigational TLR9 agonist designed to elicit a potent and focused immune response to cancer. By targeting TLR9 in both the early and late endosomes of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, SD-101 is intended to stimulate multiple mechanisms of tumor killing. SD-101 is indicated for Melanoma, Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Multiple Malignancies. For melanoma, and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, SD-101 is being tested in Phase II, and for other Multiple Malignancies, it is being tested in Phase I.DV281DV281 is an investigational TLR9 agonist designed specifically for focused delivery to primary lung tumors and lung metastases. DV281 is similar in biological activity and mechanism of action to SD-101, but has been optimized for administration as an aerosol. DV281 targets non-small cell lung cancer.The Company competes with Aduro Biotech, Inc., Idera Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Immune Design Corp. and Checkmate Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Dynavax Announces FDA Advisory Committee Meeting to Review HEPLISAV-B
Advisory Committee Meeting Scheduled for November 16, 2016

BERKELEY, CA -- (Marketwired) -- 08/05/16 --  Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) announced today that the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VBRPAC) will review the Biologics License Application (BLA) for HEPLISAV-B™ [Hepatitis B Vaccine, Recombinant (Adjuvanted)] at its meeting on November 16, 2016. The FDA has indicated it will communicate questions for the VRBPAC to address closer in time to the meeting date. HEPLISAV-B, the company's vaccine candidate for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus in adults ages 18 years of age and older, is currently under FDA review, with a 
December 15, 2016 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date.
"The upcoming VBRPAC meeting is the next step towards our goal of obtaining regulatory approval for HEPLISAV-B and we are prepared for it," said Eddie Gray, chief executive officer of Dynavax. "The company looks forward to discussing HEPLISAV-B with the advisory committee and continuing to work closely with the FDA through the review process." 
The VRBPAC reviews and evaluates data regarding the safety, efficacy, and appropriate use of vaccines and related biological products that are intended for use in the prevention, treatment, or diagnosis of human diseases.

About Hepatitis B

Hepatitis B is a viral disease of the liver that can become chronic and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In the U.S., the CDC estimates that approximately 20,000 hepatitis B infections continue to occur annually, with the vast majority occurring in adults. There is no cure for hepatitis B, and disease prevention through effective vaccination is critical to reducing the spread of the disease. Currently marketed hepatitis B vaccines are administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results of a published Vaccine Safety Datalink study showed that 54 percent of adults completed the currently available three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series in one year. Those who do not complete the series may not be adequately protected against 
hepatitis B.

About HEPLISAV-B

HEPLISAV-B is an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine that combines hepatitis B surface antigen with a proprietary Toll-like Receptor 9 agonist to enhance the immune response. HEPLISAV-B is administered in two doses over one month.
In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated higher and earlier protection with fewer doses than a currently licensed hepatitis B vaccine. It also demonstrated a similar safety profile to the existing vaccine. 
The investigational vaccine's safety profile is based on clinical trials that generated safety data from more than 14,000 participants. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection site pain. The most common systemic reactions were fatigue, headache and malaise, all of which were similar to an existing vaccine.
Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B.

About Dynavax

Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers and develops novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious diseases and oncology. Dynavax's lead product candidates are HEPLISAV-B, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine, and SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in several Phase 1/2 studies.

Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding HEPLISAV-B and FDA review. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, including whether there will be changes in the data or interpretation; whether the final study results will be deemed satisfactory by the FDA; whether additional studies or manufacturing process enhancements will be required or other issues will arise that will delay the BLA review or negatively impact the review and approval by the FDA; initiation, enrollment and completion of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials of our other product candidates, including SD-101; the results of clinical trials and the impact of those results on the initiation or continuation of subsequent trials and issues arising in the 
regulatory process; and other risks detailed in the "Risk Factors" section of our most recent current periodic report filed with the SEC. These statements represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this press release. We do not undertake any obligation to update publicly any such forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available. Information on Dynavax's website at www.dynavax.com is not incorporated by reference in our current periodic reports with the SEC.
