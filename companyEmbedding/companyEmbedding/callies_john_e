Callies Ultra Connecting Rods - American Made Quality

























































































 

 

















Rods



Callies Ultra connecting rods are produced from extremely clean Timken steel that is formulated to our exact specifications.  This proprietary steel is forged in Trenton, Michigan, and manufactured 100% in our Fostoria, Ohio facility.   Pride in workmanship, and attention to detail are qualities you’ll discover during careful examination of our finished product. Each step of the manufacturing history of every Ultra connecting rod is meticulously maintained by our manufacturing team.  You can be confident of the material and workmanship of these quality components.
Ultra I-Beams are available in our standard weight version for extreme duty racing applications of popular Big Block Chevy, Small Block Chevy, Chevy LS, Small Block Ford, Big Block Ford, and Nissan GTR,  as well as liteweight versions for select SBC configurations. For superior clamping, a bolt upgrade to Custom Age 625 material is available for all Callies I-Beams.
The Ultra H-Beam configuration was recently added as part of our expanding connecting rod line. Made from the same premium grade Timken material, the Ultra H is designed to satisfy the requirements of the most demanding racing applications.
Callies latest connecting rod innovation is our unique Ultra XD, designed for extra cam clearance on long stroke applications. The canted fastening system allows the use of a larger base circle cam for increased valvetrain stability, more lift using the same base circle, or longer stroke.  See it here.
 


 
Industry Leading Features Include:
Increased Stroker Clearance – The best bolt to block & rod to cam clearance in the industry for long stoke applications.
Bolt Spotface Gussets – Allow optimized bolt location without loss of strength or defomation of the big end bore.
100% Thread Engagement – Assures no bolt threads are left exposed in the area between the bolt thread and  shank.
Specifically Designed, 260Ksi Ultra Bolts – All Ultra bolts are designed to fit each specific connecting rod. Rolled threads are employed to provide improved engagement for a more consistent clamping load.  Callies provides and recommends the use of ARP Ultra torque lube. For a complete listing of recommended torque & stretch data, please visit our Rod Bolt Torque page.

Ultra I-Beam - Callies Performance Products






















































































 

 

















Ultra I-Beam


Ultra connecting rods are made entirely in the U.S.A. Every Ultra connecting rod is produced from specially formulated Timken 4330V steel. This material is then precision forged in Michigan and fully machined in our Fostoria, Ohio facility. Many geometric nuances have been incorporated into the design of Ultra connecting rods. These design features enhance the Ultra against specific loads and stresses which are applied to connecting rods subjected to high load, high RPM applications. Ultra connecting rods are fastened by high alloy cap screws made specifically for severe duty service by ARP Inc. Produced with rolled threads, these unique bolts offer improved thread engagement for a smoother more consistent net clamping load.  To eliminate deformation and extrusion only AMS 642 bronze alloy is used within the wrist pin housing bore.
Ultra I-Beams are available in our standard weight version for extreme duty racing applications of popular Big Block Chevy, Small Block Chevy, Chevy LS, Big Block Ford, Small Block Ford, RY45, Ford Modular, Nissan GTR, Buick 3.8, as well as lightweight versions for select SBC configurations. For superior clamping, a bolt upgrade to MP 3.5 material is available for all Callies I-Beam connecting rods.

About Callies & Morel
Contact Us



About Us:  John Callies Inc. and Morel Motorsports Inc.
John Callies Inc. is the sales engineering arm of Morel Motorsports, handling all sales of lifters and distributor gears for Morel.  We are a private label company, selling primarily to Cam Companies.  We do sell directly to Nascar Teams.
Morel first entered the racing lifters market in 1992. The plant is 100,000 square feet and has in-house heat treating with a full Metallurgical lab.  The oven is a hermetically sealed unit using different gases for controlling the heat treatment quality.  There are over 100 pieces of specialty equipment in the plant for making lifters and gears.
The plant was started by Ed Morel's uncle over 60 years ago.  Ed has worked there over 30 years and bought the company 20 years ago.  Ed is a graduate mechanical engineer.  The plant manager is also a graduate mechanical engineer.  Our designer is an engineer with 35 years of tool and die, plumbing, electrical, electronic, programming and hydraulic experience.
I am also a graduate mechanical engineer.  I spent 20 years with General Motors in the Pontiac Division, with the last 15 years heading up Ponitac Motorsports Engineering.  I left Pontiac in 1986 and started Callies Crankshaft and sold it in 1994.  I helped Joe Lunati build his company and sell it to Holly Corporation.  Then, I started building performance cam cores with Camshaft Machine Company.  We developed the three-pieces cam core using the Everwear Gear(tm), eliminating the cam gear to distributor wear issue.
Ed and I started getting serious about the lifter business in 1994.  We developed lifter programs for Street Performance lifters through Professional Racing lifters.  We continue development on new or current products every day.  The business has grown to the point that I left Camshaft Machine in 2009 to concentrate with Morel to continue to bring innovative products to the racers.
Thanks,
John Callies
