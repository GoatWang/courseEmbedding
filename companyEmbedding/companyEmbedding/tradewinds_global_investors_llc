NWQ Investment Management Company to Accelerate Growth of Global 
      Product Platform






May 16, 2016 07:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nuveen Investments, an operating division of TIAA Global Asset 
      Management, today announced that it intends to propose a series of fund 
      reorganizations to the Nuveen Funds’ Board at the Board’s upcoming 
      meeting in late May.
    


      The proposals are designed to strengthen Nuveen’s global equity 
      offerings and feature the proposed reorganizations of the Nuveen 
      Tradewinds Global All-Cap Fund (NWGAX) and the Nuveen Tradewinds Value 
      Opportunities Fund (NVOAX) into the Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund 
      (NQGAX). The proposals also include the reorganization of the closed-end 
      Nuveen Global Equity Income Fund (JGV) into the Nuveen NWQ Global Equity 
      Income Fund (NQGAX).
    

      If approved, the proposed fund reorganizations would offer target fund 
      shareholders access to a fund which has generated strong performance and 
      won the 2016 
      Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award for the best performing fund among 
      33 peers in the Global Equity Income Funds category for the three-year 
      period ending November 30, 2015.
    

      Further, if the proposed actions for the funds are approved by the 
      Funds’ Board and shareholders, they would have the effect of adding 
      scale to NWQ’s Global Equity Income Fund.
    

      Additionally, Peter Boardman, who serves as portfolio manager of the 
      Nuveen Tradewinds International Value Fund (NAIGX) and Nuveen Tradewinds 
      Japan Fund (NTJAX), as well as their related strategies, will be 
      rejoining NWQ, reuniting his successful international value investing 
      process and philosophy with that of NWQ. Subject to Board approval, NWQ 
      will replace Tradewinds as the funds’ sub-adviser. Boardman will be 
      joined by several analysts and other key individuals in the transition 
      to NWQ.
    

      “Several years ago we initiated a program to develop our 
      global/international capabilities. This is a fantastic opportunity as it 
      further enhances those capabilities which we believe will help us to 
      better serve our clients. On behalf of all employees at NWQ, I want to 
      express our appreciation to our partners at Nuveen Investments for their 
      support.” said NWQ’s John Conlin.
    

      “At no other point in our firm’s development have we been as well 
      positioned to draw upon the very best investment thinking, portfolio 
      solutions, product management expertise, and client service resources 
      from across the firm,” said Margo Cook, Co-President, Nuveen 
      Investments. “By undertaking these proposals, we ensure our ability to 
      continue to deliver the most innovative and relevant investment 
      solutions to our clients.”
    

      These proposed changes, in conjunction with a recent filing regarding 
      the planned liquidation of the Nuveen Tradewinds Emerging Markets Fund, 
      lay the foundation for the orderly wind down of Nuveen’s Tradewinds 
      Global Investors affiliate. Assuming Board and shareholder approvals for 
      the proposed fund actions are secured, Nuveen anticipates this process 
      to be complete by the end of the year. Throughout the coming months, 
      Nuveen will facilitate an organized transition to ensure clients have a 
      smooth and seamless experience.

Thomson Reuters Lipper Fund Award Calculations


      In calculating the awards, Lipper considered all open-end funds 
      registered for sale in the United States in qualifying classifications 
      with at least 36 months of performance history as of the end of the 
      calendar year. Awards were given to funds with a 3-, 5- and 10-year 
      history as at the end of the evaluation year in equity, bond and 
      mixed-asset Lipper U.S. Classifications with at least ten distinct 
      portfolios. Both group and fund awards were calculated using Lipper’s 
      Consistent Return score. More detailed information on the awards 
      methodology can be found on their website at Lipper 
      Fund Awards Methodology.
    

      Class I Shares have no sales charge and may be purchased only by 
      specified classes of investors. Other fund share class purchases may be 
      subject to a front-end sales load. The total number of funds in a Lipper 
      award classification may include multiple share classes of a single fund.
    

      Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Funds considered in 
      the Lipper Awards may have experienced negative returns during or since 
      the rating period. Mutual fund investing involves risk; principal loss 
      is possible. There is no guarantee that the funds’ investment objectives 
      will be achieved.
    

Before investing, carefully consider fund investment objectives, 
      risks, charges and expenses. For this and other information that should 
      be read carefully, please request a prospectus or summary prospectus 
      from your financial advisor or Nuveen Investments at 800.257.8787 or 
      visit www.nuveen.com.

Tradewinds’ AUM falls 72% in 10 months
 


Lagging performance adds to the bad news for parent Nuveen




    By Randy Diamond



 · December 24, 2012



Assets under management at Tradewinds Global Investors LLC are down more than two-thirds since the announcement in March that star money manager David Iben was leaving. Tradewinds data show the company was managing $10.3 billion as of Sept. 30, compared with $38 billion at the end of February, two weeks before Mr. Iben, the firm's chief investment officer, announced he was leaving. Consultants say two factors are primarily at work: Mr. Iben's strong identification with Tradewinds, and a heavy reliance on natural resources stocks that have underperformed in recent months.

Performance-wise, the firm ranks at the bottom of the heap among value managers. Its asset collapse also has wider implications for Chicago-based Nuveen Investments, Tradewinds' parent. Nuveen, which is made up of seven boutique investment affiliates, had more than $220 billion in assets under management as of Sept. 30. Tradewinds was among the most profitable units, several informed sources say. It was second in AUM among the seven affiliates before the outflow, behind Nuveen Asset, which has more than $100 billion, the sources said. But while Nuveen Asset Management is oriented toward fixed income, Tradewinds is an equity shop, with average fees double those for fixed income. Parent Nuveen has been struggling with its overall debt load, which increased to $4.5 billion from $4.1 billion following a debt restructuring in September. The debt resulted from Madison Dearborn Partners LLC, Chicago, taking the company private in a leveraged buyout in 2007.  The company, however, now faces a new debt maturity  wall of $3.1 billion in 2017.  “It will be difficult to earn their way out of this debt load,” said Rory Callagy, an analyst with Moody's Investors Services, New York. Mr. Callagy said company officials can do an initial public offering that would raise cash to pare debt, or another financing if an IPO isn't feasible. The September refinancing was Nuveen's fourth since the LBO. Nuveen spokeswoman Kathleen Cardoza said no one at Nuveen or Tradewinds would comment.



Change in plans
Several informed sources say Madison Dearborn officials were hoping they could take Nuveen public again this year, but Mr. Iben's departure for Vinik Asset Management scuttled that idea. Glen Richter, chief operating officer at Nuveen, said in a Nov. 12 earnings call that while outflows stabilized somewhat in the third quarter, he still expected more outflows this quarter. He also notedthe two major wire houses that distribute Tradewinds' products to retail investors — 
UBS Financial Services Inc. and Wells Fargo Advisors — were not adding new business while they reviewed Tradewinds. He said the review could take up to a year. UBS officials didn't return phone calls; a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo said no one would comment. Mr. Richter acknowledged that Tradewinds' AUM and revenue were “significantly lower,” but added that inflows at other affiliates offset the Tradewinds declines. Nuveen reported $220 billion in AUM at its seven affiliates as of Sept. 30, flat from the previous quarter and the third quarter of 2011. But last quarter's numbers also include $14 billion from 

Gresham Investment Management LLC, a commodities manager in which Nuveen purchased a 60% stake last December. Investment consultants attribute much of Tradewinds' asset drain to the fact that no other star was waiting in the wings when Mr. Iben left. “It's great to have a star to be the signature person associated with a strategy, but the danger is if the star stumbles or leaves,” said consultant Charlie Waibel, managing director of Sellwood Consulting LLC, Portland, Ore.  Jeffrey MacLean, Los Angeles-based CEO at 
Wurts & Associates, said Tradewinds and Mr. Iben were synonymous. Mr. Iben was the sole portfolio manager for Tradewinds' largest strategies and mutual funds and was also in charge of overseeing the stock selection for all offerings. Nuveen replaced Mr. Iben with other Tradewinds investment staffers, including portfolio managers, but none had amassed the track record of Mr. Iben.  To guard against more turnover, sources say, Nuveen signed the roughly two dozen remaining investment personnel to two-year contracts. They say they believe Nuveen remains committed to Tradewinds for now, but if assets were to continue to drop, other actions might have to be considered.  Tradewinds was spun out of another Nuveen equity-investing affiliate, 
NWQ Investment Management, in 2006. One possibility might be to reunite the two firms, the sources say.Subadviser outflows
While initial asset withdrawals after Mr. Iben's announcement were attributed largely to institutional clients that had a key-man clause in their contracts, companies that had used Tradewinds as a subadviser have followed suit. 
Northern Trust Co. (NTRS), 
ING Investment Management and Guidestone Financial Resources all terminated relationships with Tradewinds in recent months, resulting in the loss of more than $700 million in assets.John O'Connell, a spokesman at Northern Trust, declined comment. Officials at 
ING and Guidestone did not return phone calls.  But the firm's investment performance had been challenged even before Mr. Iben left, according to data provider eVestment Alliance, Marietta, Ga.  Mr. Iben's largest institutional strategy by assets, global all-cap value, had strong performance in 2010. But by the end of 2011, the strategy lagged its benchmark (the MSCI All Country World Index, net of dividends) by 444 basis points, according to eVestment Alliance. Year to date through Sept. 30, the strategy has severely underperformed, returning 0.68% compared with the benchmark's 15.64%. The global all-cap strategy separate account had $12.57 billion in AUM on Feb. 29, according to Nuveen data, but dropped to $1.3 billion as of Sept. 30, eVestment Alliance reported. Wurts' Mr. MacLean said he believes Tradewinds could rebuild its institutional client list if the firm can show a several-year track record of solid performance. Sellwood's Mr. Waibel agreed it will take time for the new team to rebuild performance, but said it's not impossible: “The San Francisco Giants have won two world championships after Barry Bonds retired.”
