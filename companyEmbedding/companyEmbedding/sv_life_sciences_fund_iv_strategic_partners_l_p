	PROXY STATEMENT




	ANNUAL
	MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS




	TO BE HELD ON MAY 25, 2017



	This proxy statement is sent by the Board of Directors (the Board) of TransEnterix, Inc. (the Company), to solicit
	proxies to be voted at our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders (the Annual Meeting) to be held on Thursday, May 25, 2017, beginning at 10:00 a.m. local time, at 635 Davis Drive, Suite 300, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560, and at
	any adjournments thereof, for the purposes stated in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. This proxy statement, the enclosed proxy card, the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the Companys 2016 Annual Report
	will first be mailed to stockholders entitled to vote on or about April 21, 2017.





	QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT THE
	ANNUAL MEETING





	Who can vote?




	Holders of record of our Common Stock as of the close of business on April 10, 2017, the record date, will be entitled to notice of and to
	vote at the Annual Meeting and at any adjournments thereof. Holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to vote on all matters brought before the Annual Meeting.


	As of the record date, there were 123,629,689 shares of Common Stock outstanding and entitled to vote on the election of directors and all
	other matters. Holders of Common Stock will vote on all matters as a class. Holders are entitled to one vote for each share of Common Stock outstanding as of the record date.


	You do not need to attend the Annual Meeting to vote your shares. Instead, you may vote your shares by marking, signing, dating and returning
	the enclosed proxy card.




	How do I vote?




	If you are a stockholder of record (your shares are registered directly in your name with our transfer agent), you may vote in person at the
	Annual Meeting, vote by proxy through the Internet or vote by proxy using the enclosed proxy card. To vote through the Internet, go to

	www.cstproxyvote.com

	and complete an electronic proxy card. You will be asked for the Company Number, Proxy
	Number and Account Number, which are provided on the enclosed proxy card. Stockholders of record who attend the Annual Meeting may vote in person by obtaining a ballot from the inspector of elections.


	If you are a beneficial owner of shares (your shares are held in the name of a brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee), you may vote by
	following the instructions provided in the voting instruction form, or other materials provided to you by the brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares. To vote in person at the Annual Meeting, you must obtain a legal proxy from
	the brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares, and present such legal proxy from the brokerage firm, bank, or other nominee that holds your shares for admittance to the Annual Meeting.


	All stockholders who plan to attend the Annual Meeting in person should be prepared to present photo identification for admittance.


	Whether you plan to attend the Annual Meeting or not, we urge you to vote by proxy to ensure your vote is counted. Voting by proxy will not
	affect your right to attend the Annual Meeting and vote. If you properly complete your paper or electronic proxy and submit it to us in time, the proxy (one of the individuals named on






	Table of Contents



	the proxy card) will vote your shares as you have directed. If you sign the proxy card but do not make specific choices, the proxy will vote your shares as recommended by the Board and, as to any
	other matters properly brought before the Annual Meeting, in the sole discretion of the proxy.




	What are the recommendations of the Board?




	The Board recommends that you vote:


	

	FOR

	the election of all nine nominees for director named in this proxy statement;


	

	FOR

	 the approval, by advisory vote, of the executive compensation of our named executive officers for 2016;


	For 

	EVERY YEAR

	 as the frequency of the stockholders future advisory votes on the compensation paid to the
	Companys named executive officers;


	

	FOR

	 the approval of the amendment of the TransEnterix, Inc. Amended and
	Restated Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the Plan) to increase the number of shares available for awards under the Plan by seven million shares; and


	

	FOR

	 the ratification of the appointment of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm for the 2017
	fiscal year.


	The Board knows of no matters that are likely to be brought before the Annual Meeting other than the matters identified in
	the Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. If any other matters properly come before the Annual Meeting, the proxy will be authorized to vote or otherwise act according to his judgment on those matters.




	What constitutes a quorum at the Annual Meeting?




	The presence in person or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock is necessary to constitute a quorum
	at the meeting. Abstentions in each of the proposals will be counted for the purpose of determining whether a quorum is present at the meeting and as votes cast and will have the effect of a negative vote. Broker

	non-votes

	will be counted for the purpose of determining the existence of a quorum at the Meeting.




	How many
	votes are required to approve the proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting?





	Election of Directors



	With regard to the election of directors under Proposal One, votes may be cast For or Withheld for one or more of the
	nominees being proposed. Directors are elected by a plurality of votes, without respect to either (1) broker

	non-votes

	or (2) proxies as to which authority to vote for one or more of the other
	nominees being proposed is withheld.






	Approval, by Advisory Vote, of Executive Compensation



	With regard to the stockholder advisory vote to approve the executive compensation for our named executive officers for 2016, the affirmative
	vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter at the Annual Meeting is required. You may vote For the proposal, Against the proposal or Abstain with respect to
	the proposal. This vote is advisory in nature and, therefore, not binding on the Company. However, our Board will consider the outcome of this vote in its future deliberations regarding executive compensation. Broker

	non-votes

	are not considered as votes cast and have no impact on the result of the vote. Abstentions are considered as negative votes.


	 


	2






	Table of Contents




	Selection, by Advisory Vote, of the Frequency of Future Say on Pay Votes



	With regard to the frequency of future advisory votes on the compensation paid to the Companys named executive officers, you may vote for
	One Year, Two Years, Three Years or Abstain with respect to the proposal. The frequency choice receiving the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to
	vote on such matter at the Annual Meeting will be deemed the choice of the stockholders. If no one frequency selection alternative receives such majority vote, the alternative receiving the most votes will be deemed the choice of the stockholders.



	Amendment of the Plan



	With regard
	to the vote to approve the amendment of the Plan, the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote on such matter at the Annual Meeting is required. You may vote For the proposal,
	Against the proposal or Abstain with respect to the proposal. Broker

	non-votes

	are not considered as votes cast and have no impact on the result of the vote. Abstentions are considered
	as negative votes.



	Ratification of BDO USA LLPs Appointment



	The ratification of the appointment of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm requires the affirmative vote of a
	majority of the votes cast by all stockholders present in person or represented by proxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal. If the selection of BDO USA LLP as our independent registered public accounting firm is not
	ratified, the Audit Committee of the Board will reconsider its selection. Brokers are permitted to vote for this routine matter without instructions from the beneficial owners of the securities. Abstentions are considered as negative votes.




	Can I revoke my proxy?




	Yes. If
	you return your proxy card or vote via the Internet, you may revoke your proxy at any time before it is exercised. You may revoke your proxy in any one of the following ways:


	 




	 


	


	 


	by voting in person at the Annual Meeting;




	 




	 


	


	 


	by delivering a written notice of revocation before the Annual Meeting with a date later than your previously delivered proxy to our principal offices at 635 Davis Drive, Suite 300, Morrisville, North Carolina 27560,
	Attention: Corporate Secretary; or




	 




	 


	


	 


	by timely delivering another electronic or paper proxy dated after the date of the proxy that you wish to revoke. Your most current proxy is the one that is counted.






	Do I have dissenters rights of appraisal with respect to any proposal to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting?




	No. Neither Delaware law nor the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws entitle stockholders to any appraisal or similar rights
	of dissenters with respect to any of the proposals to be acted upon at the Annual Meeting.




	Who is paying for this proxy solicitation?




	We will pay for this proxy solicitation. Our officers and other regular employees may solicit proxies by mail, in person or by telephone or
	telecopy. These officers and other regular employees will not receive additional compensation. The Company does not currently intend to retain a third party proxy solicitor for the Annual Meeting, but may later elect to do so. We will reimburse
	banks, brokers, nominees, custodians and fiduciaries for their reasonable


	out-of-pocket


	expenses incurred in sending the proxy materials to beneficial owners of the
	shares.

	Exosome Diagnostics, a privately-held molecular diagnostics company. Mr. Slattery received a B.S. degree in Accountancy from Bentley University and is a Certified Public Accountant.






	Director Independence




	The Board, in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment, has determined that each of our current directors qualify as independent
	directors pursuant to the applicable NYSE MKT and SEC rules and regulations, except Mr. Pope, who is currently employed as our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mr. Biffi, who is currently employed as the Chief Executive Officer
	and member of the Board of Directors, of Sofar S.p.A. (Sofar), an affiliate of TransEnterix owning approximately 15.5% of the Companys outstanding Common Stock.






	Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Management




	The Company has a separate Chairman of the Board, Mr. LaViolette, and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Pope. We believe that having an
	independent director serve as our Chairman allows our Chief Executive

	Table of Contents



	Officer to focus on our daily business, while allowing the Chairman of the Board to fulfill the fundamental Board leadership role, which includes providing advice to and independent oversight of
	our management.


	The Chairman of the Board role requires significant additional commitment, particularly as the Boards oversight
	responsibilities continue to grow due to our expanding business operations. Our Board is committed to good corporate governance and believes that it is appropriate for an independent, highly-qualified, director to serve as its Chairman.


	Our Chairman of the Board is responsible for the orderly functioning of our Board and enhancing its effectiveness. Our Chairman guides Board
	processes, provides input on agenda items and presides at Board meetings. Additionally, our Chairman acts as a liaison between our Board members and our executive management team, consulting regularly and providing guidance on Board-related matters.


	The Boards role in the risk oversight process includes receiving regular reports from members of senior management on areas of
	material risk to the Company, including operational, financial, legal and regulatory and strategic and reputational risks. In connection with its reviews of the operations of the Companys business and its corporate functions, the Board
	considers and addresses the primary risks associated with these operations and functions. Our full Board regularly engages in discussions of the most significant risks that the Company is facing and how these risks are being managed.


	In addition, each of the Boards Committees, and particularly the Audit Committee, plays a role in overseeing risk management issues that
	fall within such Committees areas of responsibility. Senior management reports on at least a quarterly basis to the Audit Committee on the most significant risks facing the Company from a financial reporting perspective and highlights any new
	risks that may have arisen since the Audit Committee last met. The Audit Committee also meets regularly in executive sessions with the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and reports any findings or issues to the full Board.
	In performing its functions, the Audit Committee and each standing committee of the Board has full access to management, as well as the ability to engage advisors. The Board receives regular reports from each of its standing committees regarding
	each committees particularized areas of focus.






	Meetings of the Board and Committees and Description of Committees





	Board of Directors



	The
	Companys Board of Directors held eight meetings and acted by written consent on five occasions during the year ended December 31, 2016. Such meetings consisted of meetings at which a quorum of the directors was present in person or by
	telephone. Each of our directors attended at least 75% of the meetings of the Board and the committees on which they served during 2016. The Company does not have a formal policy with regard to board members attendance at annual meetings, but
	encourages them to attend each stockholders meeting. All of the then-current directors attended our most recent annual meeting of stockholders, held on June 8, 2016, with the exception of Dr. Hsiao.



	Audit Committee



	The current members of
	the Companys Audit Committee are Mr. Pfenniger, Chair, Mr. Milne and Dr. Kherani. Mr. Pfenniger serves as the Chair of the Audit Committee. Due to each members extensive experience in serving operating companies in
	both managerial and director capacities, the Board determined that each member has the requisite knowledge of financial statements and general understanding of financial and reporting matters to allow each such member to serve on the Audit
	Committee. The Audit Committee Charter is available on our website at

	www.transenterix.com

	.


	The Board, in the exercise of its
	reasonable business judgment and utilizing the general standards it applies for determining the independence of directors, has determined that each of the current and incoming Audit Committee members qualifies as independent pursuant to NYSE MKT
	Rule 803.

	Finally, the Board has determined that Mr. Pfenniger is an audit committee financial expert
	as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation

	S-K.

	The Board made this determination based on Mr. Pfennigers extensive career and background serving as an accountant and auditor as well as his
	serving various operating companies in both managerial and director capacities.


	The Audit Committee held seven meetings and acted by
	written consent on one occasion during the year ended December 31, 2016.


	The following constitutes the report the Audit Committee
	has made to the Board of Directors:






	REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE



	To the Board of Directors of TransEnterix, Inc.


	The Audit
	Committee has reviewed and discussed with management the Companys audited financial statements contained in its Annual Report on Form

	10-K

	for fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the Annual
	Report), and has discussed with the Companys independent registered public accounting firm the matters required to be discussed by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Auditing Standard No. 16 (as of December 31, 2016,
	codified as Auditing Standard No. 1301) (Communications with Audit Committees). Additionally, the Audit Committee has received the written disclosures and the letter from the Companys independent registered public accounting firm
	concerning its independence as required by applicable requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding communications with the Audit Committee, and has discussed with the Companys independent registered public accounting
	firm its independence.


	In performing its functions, the Audit Committee acts in an oversight capacity. The Audit Committee relies on the work and
	assurances of the Companys management, which has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and reports, and of the independent registered public accounting firm, which, in its report, expresses an opinion on the conformity of the
	Companys annual financial statements to generally accepted accounting principles. In reliance on these reviews and discussions, and the report of the independent registered public accounting firm, the Audit Committee recommended to the Board
	of Directors, and the Board of Directors approved, the inclusion of the Companys audited financial statements in the Annual Report.

	There have been no material changes to the procedures by which security holders may recommend
	nominees to the Companys Board of Directors. Please see Board Nominations by Security Holders on pages 14 and 15 of this Annual Report for a description of such procedures. The specific process for evaluating new directors,
	including stockholder-recommended nominees, will vary based on an assessment of the then-current needs of the Board and the Company. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee will determine the desired profile of a new director, the
	competencies we are seeking, including experience in one or more of the following: highest personal and professional integrity, demonstrated exceptional ability and judgment and who shall be most effective in conjunction with the other nominees to
	the board, in collectively serving the long-term interests of the stockholders. Candidates will be evaluated in light of the target criteria chosen. The Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee does not have a formal diversity policy; in
	addition to the foregoing, it considers race and gender diversity in selection of qualified candidates.


	The Corporate Governance and
	Nominating Committee held two meetings and acted by written consent on one occasion during the year ended December 31, 2016. On April 10, 2017, the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee nominated the nine nominees identified in

	EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION







	Compensation Discussion and Analysis




	This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) describes our compensation program for our named executive officers
	(Named Executive Officers) during the year ended December 31, 2016. The following discussion focuses on our compensation program and

	compensation-related

	decisions for 2016 and also addresses
	why we believe our compensation program is appropriate for the Company.




	Business Overview for 2016




	The Company is a medical device company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical
	challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options. The Company is focused on the commercialization and further development of its Senhance System, a multi-port robotic system that brings the advantages of robotic surgery to
	patients while enabling surgeons with innovative technology. The Company also developed the SurgiBot System, a single-port, robotically enhanced laparoscopic surgical platform. The Senhance System has been granted a CE Mark in Europe for
	laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery, as well as limited thoracic operations excluding cardiac and vascular surgery, but is not available for sale in the U.S. The SurgiBot System is not available for sale in any market.


	The Senhance System is a multi-port robotic surgery system which allows multiple arms to control robotic instruments and a camera. The system
	features advanced technology to enable surgeons with haptic feedback and the ability to move the camera via eye movement. The system replicates laparoscopic motion that is familiar to experienced surgeons, and features 3DHD vision technology. The
	Senhance System also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery.


	The SurgiBot System is designed to utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly by the surgeon, with robotic
	assistance, while the surgeon remains patient-side within the sterile field. In June 2015, the Company submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA for the SurgiBot System. On April 19, 2016, the FDA notified the Company that the SurgiBot System
	did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based on the data and information submitted by TransEnterix in the 510(k) submission. After interactions with the FDA, the Company determined that a new 510(k) application would need to be
	submitted in order to obtain clearance for the SurgiBot System. Based on this fact, the Company evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two 510(k) applications in parallel and elected to primarily focus the Companys
	near term regulatory efforts on the 510(k) submission for the Senhance System, and its current strategy is to focus the Companys resources on the commercialization of and regulatory clearance for the Senhance System.


	Consequently, in May 2016, the Company implemented a restructuring plan. The restructuring plan resulted in: 1) reducing the Companys
	workforce; 2) abandoning certain equipment; 3) cancelling certain contracts; 4) writing off inventory related to the SurgiBot System; and 5) writing off certain patents.




	Compensation philosophy




	The
	Company believes it is vital to link executive compensation to corporate performance and to create incentives for management to enhance Company value. In accordance with its compensation philosophy, the Company seeks to attract and retain employees
	through salary levels that are competitive with the local market and similarly situated companies but generally to follow the market rather than lead the market, particularly with respect to cash compensation, and offer attractive equity and
	cash-based incentive components to align compensation with Company performance objectives. The Company desires, over time, to move total direct compensation toward the median of comparable companies, while remaining more aggressive in the use of
	equity-based compensation, but not in a market leader position. The Company believes this approach allows it to attract and retain candidates that support the Company culture of being motivated by aggressive goals and optimism about the future,
	while permitting the Company to preserve the use of cash for incentive compensation.

	Table of Contents



	The Company is the result of a reverse merger of a privately held,

	venture-backed

	company and a publicly traded company, consummated on September 3, 2013 (the Merger), and the subsequent acquisition of the Senhance System in 2015. The Compensation
	Committees focus for 2016 was to establish a program to provide compensation to the executives aligned with the Companys need to integrate the Senhance System development and early commercialization activities and the SurgiBot System
	development activities, with a focus on

	performance-based

	incentive compensation designed to incentivize the Named Executive Officers to pursue regulatory approval for the SurgiBot System in the United States,
	finance the Company through such development stage and support the early commercialization activities related to the Senhance System in identified countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.




	Procedures for determining compensation




	Our Compensation Committee has the overall responsibility for designing and evaluating the compensation policies and programs for our Named
	Executive Officers. In 2016, the Compensation Committee reviewed updated information procured, aggregated and summarized from public sources regarding similarly situated companies, and compensation of the Named Executive Officers in prior years. The
	Compensation Committee also relied on input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding the Named Executive Officers (other than himself), and on its analysis of our corporate performance. With respect to the compensation for the Chief Executive
	Officer, each year the Compensation Committee evaluates the Chief Executive Officers performance, sets his compensation and approves his compensation. In 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the salary, annual incentive bonus and the
	long-term equity awards for the Chief Executive Officer.


	Our Chief Executive Officer plays a significant role in the compensation-setting
	process of the other Named Executive Officers and makes recommendations to the Compensation Committee concerning performance objectives and salary and bonus levels for the other Named Executive Officers and executive team. The Compensation
	Committee, at least annually, discusses such recommendations with the Chief Executive Officer. The Compensation Committee may, in its sole discretion, approve, in whole or in part, the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer. In 2016, the
	Compensation Committee approved the Chief Executive Officers recommendations for salary, bonus and

	long-term

	equity awards for each of the other Named Executive Officers.


	At each of the annual meetings of stockholders held in 2014, 2015 and 2016, stockholders holding approximately 98% of the votes cast approved,
	on an advisory basis, the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers for the prior calendar year. The Compensation Committee monitors and considers these advisory vote results in making compensation decisions. The Compensation Committee will
	continue to monitor the annual


	say-on-pay


	results and include such results in its annual executive compensation analysis.




	Elements of compensation




	The
	compensation of our Named Executive Officers consists primarily of four major components:


	 




	 


	


	 


	base salary;




	 




	 


	


	 


	annual cash-based incentive awards;




	 




	 


	


	 


	long-term equity awards; and




	 




	 


	


	 


	other benefits.







	Base salary





	The base salary of each of our Named Executive Officers is determined based on an evaluation of the responsibilities of that particular
	position, each Named Executive Officers historical salary earned in similar management positions with the Company or other companies, and a review of the information procured by the Committee as described above. A significant portion of each
	Named Executive Officers total compensation is in


	 


	17






	Table of Contents



	the form of base salary. The base salary component is designed to provide the Named Executive Officers with consistent income and to attract and retain talented and experienced executives capable
	of leading our product development, operations and strategic growth.


	In February 2016, Messrs. Pope and Slattery received merit increases
	in their base salary, retroactive to January 1, 2016, and Mr. Fernando was determined to be an executive officer of the Company. At such time, Mr. Fernandos received an increase to his base salary in connection with his
	promotion to Chief Technology Officer. The 2016 base salaries for the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table following this CD&A.





	Annual incentive plan





	The Compensation Committee established the 2016 annual cash incentive plan for management (the Incentive Plan) at its February 2016
	meeting, and finalized 2016 Incentive Plan goals in June 2016. The Incentive Plan is designed to recognize and reward our executives, including the Named Executive Officers, for contributing towards the achievement of our annual corporate business
	plan. The annual Incentive Plan awards are designed to reward near-term operating performance and the achievement of milestones critical to the Companys success. The Compensation Committee believes the Incentive Plan serves as a valuable
	short-term incentive program for providing cash bonus opportunities for executives upon achievement of targeted product development and operating results. The maximum annual cash incentive plan award opportunity was 75% for Mr. Pope and 50% of
	base salary for each of Messrs. Slattery and Fernando. For the Named Executive Officers, the 2016 goals were 100% weighted on the approved corporate goals. The 2016 Incentive Plan corporate goals, which were each weighted by the Committee, were:


	1. Receipt of FDA clearance for the SurgiBot System;


	2. Achievement of revenue goals for early commercialization of the Senhance System in Europe and, if cleared in the U.S., of the SurgiBot
	System;


	3. Regulatory milestones for the Companys products; and


	4. Development and execution of financing strategies to fund the Companys operations during development and early commercialization
	periods.


	Additional stretch goals related to regulatory clearances and commercialization were also established.


	At a meeting held in February 2017, the Compensation Committee reviewed the achievement of the corporate goals under the 2016 Incentive Plan.
	The Compensation Committee noted the FDAs decision not to provide clearance for the SurgiBot System, which occurred in April 2016, and the impact of such event on the Companys business and operations. The Compensation Committee reviewed
	the impact of the FDA decision on the Companys strategic focus, the 2016 activities of the management team following the FDA decision, including the decisions made to

	re-focus

	the Companys U.S.
	regulatory strategy on the Senhance System, the financial status of the Company at the end of the year, the results of the early commercialization activities for the Senhance System, and the integration of the Senhance Acquisition during 2016. The
	Compensation Committee also considered the bonuses that had been paid under the 2015 incentive plan. After considering the foregoing factors, the Compensation Committee approved annual incentive plan payouts at 30% of the target bonus levels under
	the 2016 Incentive Plan. The 2016 Incentive Plan bonuses for the Named Executive Officers are set forth in the Summary Compensation Table following this CD&A. The incentive compensation awarded was paid in the first quarter of 2017.

	Long-term equity awards





	The Compensation Committee believes that it is essential to align the interests of the Named Executive Officers with the interests of our
	stockholders, and believes the best way to accomplish this alignment is through awards of long-term, equity-based compensation. Such awards are made under the Companys Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the
	Plan).


	For 2016, the Compensation Committee discussed the form such equity-based grants should take and determined that
	providing a mixture of time-based stock options and restricted stock units (RSU) best met the needs of the Company and its executives as a retention incentive. Such stock option and RSU awards were granted under the Plan in February
	2016. The time-based stock option awards typically vest over a four year period with the first 25% cliff vesting on the first anniversary of the date of grant and then vesting monthly thereafter. For the RSU awards, the awards vest

	one-third

	on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. In October 2016, the Compensation Committee made additional stock option grants to the Named Executive Officers as a retention incentive.


	The grant date value of the awards made to the Named Executive Officers is set forth in the Summary Compensation Table following this
	CD&A.


	The Compensation Committee periodically reviews long-term incentives to assure that our executive officers and other key
	employees are appropriately motivated and rewarded in a way that is aligned with our long-term financial results.





	Other benefits






	Perquisites and other benefits 

	We offer our Named Executive Officers modest perquisites and other personal
	benefits that we believe are reasonable and in our best interest and generally in line with benefits we offer to all of our employees. See the disclosure in the Summary Compensation Table for more information.



	Employment agreements and severance benefits 

	We have entered into employment agreements with each Named Executive Officer. These
	agreements provide our Named Executive Officers with certain severance benefits in the event of involuntary termination. See Executive Compensation  Agreements with Named Executive Officers.



	Pension benefits 

	The Company has no defined benefit plans, supplemental executive retirement plans or actuarial plans.



	Nonqualified defined contribution and other deferred compensation plans 

	The Company does not have a defined contribution plan
	and has not contributed to a deferred compensation plan.

	Agreements with Named Executive Officers





	Todd M. Pope



	On February 3, 2015,
	the Company entered into an employment agreement with Todd M. Pope regarding Mr. Popes continued employment with the Company as its President and Chief Executive Officer. The initial employment period under the employment agreement
	commenced on September 3, 2013 and continued until December 31, 2015. The term of the employment agreement automatically renews for successive

	one-year

	terms, unless terminated in accordance with the
	terms of the employment agreement. Mr. Popes annual base salary under the employment agreement for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $453,200. Mr. Popes salary is subject to increase in accordance with the employment
	agreement. He is eligible to receive annually, or otherwise, an incentive compensation award opportunity, payable in cash, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board, and he is eligible for long term incentive equity compensation.
	Mr. Popes target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity will not be less than 50% of his base salary for the portion of the employment period falling within a given fiscal year, and performance goals are based on both Company
	performance metrics and personal performance metrics, as established and approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board annually. The equity-based compensation will be awarded under the Companys Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation
	Plan, or any successor thereto, in the discretion of the Compensation Committee or the Board. Mr. Pope is entitled to severance benefits, paid by the Company or any successor, as follows. If the employment agreement is terminated without cause
	or for good reason, or if the employment agreement is not extended at the end of the then-current term, Mr. Pope will receive severance and continued health and welfare benefits for twelve months following termination. If Mr. Popes
	employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the employment agreement), his severance benefits would be expanded to twenty-four (24) months. The severance payable is the sum of (a) his
	annual rate of base salary immediately preceding his termination of employment, and (b) his target annual bonus for the fiscal year in which the termination occurs. In addition, Mr. Pope would continue to receive payment for health care
	benefits for such period. Such severance benefit can be paid in a lump sum in the Change in Control context, subject to a payment delay required by applicable law. In addition, in the event of termination of his employment in connection with a
	Change in Control, to the extent not previously accelerated, all of Mr. Popes unvested outstanding equity awards shall accelerate and vest upon the date of termination. Mr. Pope is subject to

	non-solicitation

	and

	non-competition

	covenants during the terms of the employment agreement and for one (1) year immediately following the termination of his
	employment.



	Joseph P. Slattery



	In
	connection with his hiring, we entered into an offer letter, which constituted an employment agreement, with Mr. Slattery in September 2013. Under the employment agreement, Mr. Slattery is entitled to receive a base salary and an annual
	bonus, as determined by the Compensation Committee. Mr. Slattery also received a grant of 200,000 RSUs, which vested

	one-third

	(1/3) per year on the first three anniversaries of Mr. Slatterys
	start date with the Company (the Initial RSU Grant). As of October 2016, the Initial RSU Grant vested fully.


	Under the
	employment agreement, Mr. Slattery was entitled to a stock option grant exercisable for 500,000 shares of the Companys common stock (the Fundraising Option Grant) following the successful closing of a Company fundraising in
	which at least $20.0 million in proceeds was raised for the Company and where at least 50% of the funds raised come from

	non-insiders

	(the Fundraising). The Fundraising Option Grant was
	awarded on April 21, 2014, with an exercise price of $4.02 per share, with vesting of 25% on the one (1) year anniversary of Mr. Slatterys start date and thereafter vesting in

	thirty-six

	(36) equal monthly installments. Mr. Slattery was prohibited from exercising any the Fundraising Option Grant for a period of six (6) months following the date of grant.


	Any remaining unvested portion of the Fundraising Stock Option Grant will accelerate and vest in the event of Mr. Slatterys
	involuntary termination from employment with the Company at the time of or within twelve (12) months following a change of control.


	 


	24






	Table of Contents



	In the event that there is a change of control of the Company affecting his employment,
	Mr. Slattery shall be entitled to receive a lump sum payment, paid by the Company or any successor, equal to 12 months of his base salary and reimbursement for COBRA premiums for a period of up to 12 months, subject to signing a
	release of claims in favor of TransEnterix.



	Anthony Fernando



	On August 14, 2015, Mr. Fernando entered into an employment agreement with the Company as its Vice President, International
	Development. The initial employment period under the employment agreement commenced on August 16, 2015 and continued until December 31, 2016. The term of the employment agreement automatically renews for successive

	one-year

	terms, unless terminated in accordance with the terms of the employment agreement. Under the agreement, Mr. Fernando is entitled to receive a base salary and annual bonus, as determined by the
	Compensation Committee, and a

	one-time

	signing bonus.


	Mr. Fernando will be eligible to
	receive annually or otherwise any incentive compensation awards, payable in cash, which the Company, the Compensation Committee or such other authorized committee of the Board determines to award. For each fiscal year of the Company falling in whole
	or in part during the Employment Period, Mr. Fernandos target annual cash incentive compensation opportunity will be no less than 25% of his base salary for the portion of the Employment Period falling within that fiscal year. With
	respect to the annual cash incentive compensation award, the performance goals shall be based on performance metrics approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board annually.


	Mr. Fernando also received an initial stock option grant of 200,000 shares of TransEnterix common stock. These options will vest 25% one
	year following the grant date and 1/48 per month thereafter for the next three years. After four years, the full amount of this option grant will be vested. The grant date for this initial option grant was August 17, 2015.


	In the event of termination of Mr. Fernandos employment by the Company without Cause or by Mr. Fernando for Good Reason, each
	as defined in the employment agreement, Mr. Fernando shall be entitled to his base salary and any other compensation and benefits to the extent actually earned by him under the agreement or under any benefit plan or program of the Company as of
	the date of such termination at the normal time for payment of such salary, compensation or benefits; business reimbursements; and severance and continued health and welfare benefits for a

	six-month

	period. If
	Mr. Fernandos employment is terminated in connection with a Change in Control of the Company (as defined in the employment agreement), his severance benefits will be expanded to twelve (12) months. In addition, in the event of
	termination of his employment in connection with a Change in Control, to the extent not previously accelerated, all of Mr. Fernandos unvested outstanding equity awards shall accelerate and vest upon the date of termination.


	Mr. Fernando is subject to

	non-solicitation

	and

	non-competition

	covenants during the terms of the employment agreement and for one (1) year immediately following the termination of his employment.

	The named executive officers get no compensation, other than accrued obligations, in other
	termination events, including voluntary termination by the executive or termination on death or disability of the executive. The following table calculates what the severance compensation would have been for the named executive officers if a
	qualifying termination had occurred at December 31, 2016:

	Equity Compensation Plan




	The Company currently has one equity compensation plan under which it makes awards, the TransEnterix, Inc. Amended and Restated Incentive
	Compensation Plan, as amended (the Plan). The Plan was originally approved by the Board of Directors and adopted by the majority of our stockholders on November 13, 2007, and amended and restated and approved by the Board of
	Directors and approved by the majority of our stockholders on May 7, 2015 to increase the number of shares of common stock authorized under the Plan to 11,940,000 shares, and to make other changes. The Plan was amended on June 8, 2016 to
	increase in the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan to 18,940,000 shares. The Plan is used for plan-based awards for officers, other employees, consultants, advisors and

	non-employee

	directors. The Company can issue stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards under the Plan. In connection with the Merger, we assumed all of the options that were issued and outstanding immediately
	prior to the Merger as issued by TransEnterix Surgical, and adjusted based on the Merger at the exchange ratio, which are now exercisable for approximately 1,870,892 shares of common stock. Such options were granted under the TransEnterix, Inc. 2006
	Stock Plan (the 2006 Plan) which was assumed by the Company in the Merger. The 2006 Plan is maintained solely for the purpose of the stock options granted under such 2006 Plan that remain outstanding; no future awards are authorized to
	be made under the 2006 Plan.

	Compensation Arrangements




	On May 28, 2014, the Board approved a plan of compensation for its

	non-employee

	directors. Under the compensation plan, each new

	non-employee

	director receives a stock option grant to purchase 30,000 shares of Common Stock, vesting in
	equal installments on the first three anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, each

	non-employee

	member of the Board receives an annual stock option grant to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock; the
	Chair of the Board receives an annual stock option grant to purchase an additional 10,000 shares of Common Stock; and the Chair of each of the Audit, Compensation and Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee receives an annual additional stock
	option grant to purchase 5,000 shares of Common Stock. The annual stock option grants vest quarterly over one year. The term of each stock option is ten years and all such stock options are awarded under, and subject to the provisions of, the Plan.






	REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE



	The
	Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with the Companys management. Based on this review and discussion, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board of

	PROPOSALS TO BE ACTED UPON AT THE ANNUAL MEETING









	PROPOSAL ONE  ELECTION OF DIRECTORS



	The Board has nominated the nine incumbent directors for

	re-election

	as directors to serve until our
	next annual meeting and until each directors successor is duly elected and qualified. Each director nominee has consented to being named as a director nominee in this proxy statement and to serving as a director, if elected. Please see pages 6
	through 9 of this proxy statement under the heading Directors for information regarding the nine nominees for election as a director.




	Nominees for election of directors




	The persons named in the enclosed form of proxy will vote the shares represented by such proxy for the election of the nine nominees for
	director named below. If, at the time of the Meeting, any of these nominees shall become unavailable for any reason, which event is not expected to occur, the persons entitled to vote the proxy will vote for such substitute nominee or nominees, if
	any, as they determine in their sole discretion. If elected, Paul A. LaViolette, Todd M. Pope, Andrea Biffi, Jane H. Hsiao, William N. Kelley, Aftab R. Kherani, David B. Milne, Richard C. Pfenniger, Jr. and William N. Starling, Jr. will each hold
	office for a term of one year, until their successors are duly elected or appointed or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.




	Vote required and recommendation





	The Board of Directors recommends a vote


	


	For


	


	the election of Messrs. LaViolette, Pope, Biffi, Milne,
	Pfenniger and Starling and Drs. Hsiao, Kelley and Kherani to the Board of Directors.

	Directors are elected by a plurality of votes. Unless otherwise specified, the enclosed proxy will be voted For the election of the Board of
	Directors slate of nominees. Discretionary authority may be exercised by the proxy holders named in the enclosed proxy to vote for a substitute nominee proposed by the Board of Directors if any nominee becomes unavailable for election.








	PROPOSAL TWO  ADVISORY VOTE ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION (SAY ON PAY)



	In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) was enacted. Under the
	Dodd-Frank Act, the Company is providing the stockholders a vote to approve, on an advisory (nonbinding) basis, the compensation paid to our Named Executive Officers in 2016 as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the SECs
	rules.


	This proposal, commonly known as a


	say-on-pay


	proposal, gives the stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our Named Executive Officers compensation. This vote is not
	intended to address any specific element of our executive compensation programs, but rather to address our overall approach to the compensation of our Named Executive Officers as described in this proxy statement. The Board is asking the
	stockholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation program, as described in this proxy statement, by voting For the following resolution:


	RESOLVED, that the stockholders approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of the Named Executive Officers for 2016, as disclosed in this
	proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Compensation Discussion and Analysis, the Summary Compensation Table and the other compensation tables and disclosure.




	Advisory Nature of the Vote




	Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Compensation
	Committee and the Board value the opinions of the stockholders and, to the extent there is any significant vote against the Companys compensation practices for the Named Executive


	 


	28






	Table of Contents



	Officers as disclosed in this proxy statement, the Board will consider this stockholders vote and the Compensation Committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the
	stockholders concerns when considering future executive compensation arrangements.




	Vote required and recommendation




	Proposal Two requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote.



	The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote For the proposal.

	Unless otherwise specified, the enclosed proxy
	will be voted For approval of Proposal Two.








	PROPOSAL THREE  ADVISORY VOTE ON THE FREQUENCY OF SAY ON PAY



	The Dodd-Frank Act also requires us to provide the stockholders with an advisory vote on how frequently in the future the Company
	should seek an advisory vote approving the compensation of our Named Executive Officers, as disclosed pursuant to the SECs compensation disclosure rules. In voting on this Proposal Three, stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer an
	advisory vote on Named Executive Officers compensation once every one, two, or three years. If desired, as set forth in the attached proxy, a stockholder may abstain from voting on Proposal Three.


	The Board has considered the Dodd-Frank Act requirements for such


	say-on-pay


	frequency vote and has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate alternative for
	the Company. The appropriate frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation is the subject of diverging opinions and views, and the Board believes there is reasonable basis for each of the three options. Less frequency would encourage a
	more long-term, rather than short-term, analysis of our executive compensation programs and would avoid the burden that annual votes would impose on stockholders required to evaluate the executive compensation program each year. On the other hand,
	greater frequency provides stockholders the opportunity to react promptly to emerging trends in compensation and gives the Board and the Compensation Committee the opportunity to evaluate the compensation program each year in light of timely input
	from stockholders.




	Advisory Nature of the Vote




	Because this vote is advisory, it will not be binding upon the Company, the Compensation Committee or the Board. However, the Compensation
	Committee and the Board of Directors values the stockholders opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation.




	Vote required and recommendation




	The alternative of One Year, Two Years or Three Years that receives the affirmative vote of the majority of
	shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote will be deemed the choice of the stockholders. If no one frequency selection alternative receives such majority vote, the alternative receiving the most votes will be deemed the choice of the
	stockholders.



	The Board of Directors recommends that stockholders vote for One Year in Proposal Three.

	Unless
	otherwise specified, the enclosed proxy will be voted for One Year.

	PROPOSAL FOUR  AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDED AND RESTATED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION
	PLAN



	The purpose of the TransEnterix, Inc. Amended and Restated Incentive Compensation Plan, as amended (the Plan) is to
	assist us in attracting, motivating, retaining and rewarding high-quality executives and other employees, officers, directors, consultants and other persons who provide services to us and our subsidiaries and affiliates. We are proposing to amend
	the Plan as described in this proposal. The form of Amendment approved by the Board is attached to this proxy statement as Annex A. The Plan is intended to enable those persons to acquire or increase an ownership interest in us in order to
	strengthen the mutuality of interests between them and our stockholders, and to provide those such persons with performance incentives to expend their maximum efforts in the creation of stockholder value.


	As of March 31, 2017, 18,940,000 shares of Common Stock were authorized for issuance under the Plan, of which 3,220,372 shares remain
	available for future issuance.




	Changes Proposed to be made to the Plan




	In order to continue to provide the appropriate equity incentives to plan participants in the future, on February 2, 2017, the Board of
	Directors approved, subject to stockholder approval at this Annual Meeting, an amendment of the Plan to increase the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Plan by 7,000,000 shares from 18,940,000 shares to 25,940,000
	shares.




	Reasons for the Proposed Changes




	The Company desires to have sufficient shares available for incentive and compensation awards to be made under the Plan for at least the next
	18 months as it pursues regulatory approvals for initial commercial launch activities in the U.S. related to the Senhance System. In conjunction with the acquisition of the Senhance System, the Company increased its employee base, including adding a
	number of members of its senior management team. In anticipation of the need for additional senior management team members to assist in commercialization of the Companys products and products in development, management recognizes that
	additional employees, advisors and consultants may be hired or retained. The Company wants to position itself to be able to provide equity awards to such newly hired officers and other employees, and believes it is prudent to maintain sufficient
	authorized shares to allow it to make new hire, promotion and annual equity awards to employees, advisors and consultants. Therefore, the Company is seeking approval to add an additional 7,000,000 shares to the Plan. The Company believes that such
	additional shares will be sufficient to provide available shares for approximately one to two years.


	The Amendment to the Plan to provide
	for the increase in the number of authorized shares available for future awards is attached to this proxy statement as

	Annex A

	.




	Description of the Plan




	The following is a summary of the principal features of the Plan.




	Shares Available for Awards; Annual

	Per-Person

	Limitations




	Under the Plan, 18,940,000 shares of Common Stock are reserved for issuance, of which 3,220,372 remain available for new issuances, as of
	March 31, 2017. If the Amendment to the Plan is approved at this Annual Meeting, the total number of shares of Common Stock reserved under the Plan would be increased by 7,000,000 shares to an aggregate of 25,940,000 shares. Any shares that are
	subject to awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, deferred stock or other awards count against this limit as one share for every share granted.


	 


	30






	Table of Contents



	If any shares subject to an award are forfeited, expire or otherwise terminate without issuance
	of shares, or are settled for cash or otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares, then the shares subject to such forfeiture, expiration, termination, cash settlement or

	non-issuance

	will again become
	available for awards under the Plan. If any option or other award is exercised through the tendering of shares (either actually or by attestation) or withheld upon exercise of an award to pay the exercise price or any tax withholding requirements,
	then only the net of the shares tendered or withheld count towards the limit. Awards issued in substitution for awards previously granted by a company acquired by us or one of our subsidiaries or affiliates, or with which we or one of our
	subsidiaries or affiliates combines, do not reduce the limit on grants of awards under the Plan. If the amendment and restatement of the Plan is approved by stockholders, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be issued under the Plan
	as a result of the exercise of incentive stock options is 25,940,000 shares, subject to the adjustments described in the Plan.


	The Plan
	imposes individual limitations on the amount of certain awards. Under these limitations, during any fiscal year of the Company, no eligible person may be granted (i) stock options or stock appreciation rights with respect to more than 1,000,000
	shares of Common Stock, or (ii) shares of restricted stock, shares of deferred stock, performance shares and other stock based-awards with respect to more than 500,000 shares of Common Stock, in each case, subject to adjustment in certain
	circumstances. The maximum amount that may be paid out as performance units (which are described below) with respect to any

	12-month

	performance period is $2,000,000

	(pro-rated

	for any

	12-month

	performance period that is less than 12 months), and for any performance period that is more than 12 months, is $2,000,000 multiplied by the
	number of full

	12-month

	periods that are in the performance period.


	The Compensation Committee
	(referred to in this description as the committee) administers the Plan and is authorized to adjust the limitations described above and is authorized to adjust outstanding awards (including adjustments to exercise prices of options and
	other affected terms of awards) in the event that an extraordinary dividend or other distribution (whether in cash, shares of Common Stock or other property), recapitalization, forward or reverse split, reorganization, merger, consolidation,

	spin-off,

	combination, repurchase, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or other similar corporate transaction or event affects our Common Stock so that an adjustment is appropriate. The committee is also
	authorized to adjust performance conditions and other terms of awards in response to these kinds of events or in response to changes in applicable laws, regulations or accounting principles.

	non-employee

	directors, employees and current consultants were eligible to participate in
	the Plan.

	Administration




	The Plan is administered by the committee; provided, however, that except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the Board may exercise
	any power or authority granted to the committee under the Plan. Subject to the terms of the Plan, the committee is authorized to select eligible persons to receive awards, determine the type, number and other terms and conditions of, and all other
	matters relating to, awards, prescribe award agreements (which need not be identical for each participant), and the rules and regulations for the administration of the Plan, construe and interpret the Plan and award agreements, correct defects,
	supply omissions or reconcile inconsistencies therein, and make all other decisions and determinations as the committee may deem necessary or advisable for the administration of the Plan.




	Stock Options and Stock Appreciation Rights




	The committee is authorized to grant stock options, including both incentive stock options, which we refer to as ISOs, which can
	result in potentially favorable tax treatment to the recipient, and

	non-qualified

	stock options, and stock appreciation rights entitling the recipient to receive the amount by which the fair market value of a
	share of the Common Stock on the date of exercise exceeds the grant price of the stock appreciation right. The exercise price per share subject to an option and the grant price of a stock appreciation right are determined by the committee, but the
	exercise price of a stock option that is intended to qualify as an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code, and the grant price of a stock appreciation right, may not be less than the fair market value of a share of the Common
	Stock on the date of grant. For purposes of the Plan, the term fair market value means the fair market value of the Common Stock, awards or other property as determined by the committee or under procedures established by the committee.
	Unless otherwise determined by the committee, the fair market value of a share of the Common Stock as of any given date is the closing sales price per share as reported on the principal stock exchange or market on which the Common Stock is traded on
	the date as of which such value is being determined or, if there is no sale on that date, then on the last previous day on which a sale was reported. The maximum term of each option or stock appreciation right, the times at which each option or
	stock appreciation right will be exercisable, and provisions requiring forfeiture of unexercised options or stock appreciation rights at or following termination of employment generally are fixed by the committee, except that no option or stock
	appreciation right may have a term exceeding ten years. Methods of exercise and settlement and other terms of the stock appreciation right are determined by the committee. The committee, thus, may permit the exercise price of options awarded under
	the Plan to be paid in cash, shares, other awards or other property (including loans). Options may be exercised by payment of the exercise price in cash, shares of Common Stock, outstanding awards or other property having a fair market value equal
	to the exercise price, as the committee may determine from time to time.




	Restricted and Deferred Stock




	The committee is authorized to grant restricted stock and deferred stock. Restricted stock is a grant of shares of Common Stock which may not
	be sold or disposed of, and which will be subject to any risks of forfeiture and other restrictions as the committee may impose. An eligible person granted restricted stock generally has all of the rights of a Company stockholder, unless otherwise
	determined by the committee. An award of deferred stock confers upon the recipient the right to receive shares of Common Stock at the end of a specified deferral period, subject to any risks of forfeiture and other restrictions as the committee may
	impose. Prior to settlement, an award of deferred stock carries no voting or dividend rights or other rights associated with share ownership, although dividend equivalents may be granted, as discussed below.




	Dividend Equivalents




	The committee is authorized to grant dividend equivalents conferring on recipients the right to receive, currently or on a deferred basis,
	cash, shares of Common Stock, other awards or other property equal in value to dividends paid on a specific number of shares of Common Stock or other periodic payments. Dividend


	 


	32






	Table of Contents



	equivalents may be granted alone or in connection with another award, may be paid currently or on a deferred basis and, if deferred, may be deemed to have been reinvested in additional shares of
	Common Stock, awards or otherwise as specified by the committee.




	Bonus Stock and Awards in Lieu of Cash Obligations




	The committee is authorized to grant shares of Common Stock as a bonus, free of restrictions, or to grant shares of Common Stock or other
	awards in lieu of obligations of us to pay cash under the Plan or other plans or compensatory arrangements, subject to any terms that the committee may specify.




	Other Stock-Based Awards




	The committee is authorized to grant awards that are denominated or payable in, valued by reference to, or otherwise based on or related to
	shares of Common Stock. The committee determines the terms and conditions of those awards.




	Performance Awards




	The committee is authorized to grant performance awards to eligible persons on terms and conditions established by the committee. The
	performance criteria to be achieved during any performance period, and the length of the performance period, are determined by the committee upon the grant of the performance award. Performance awards may be valued by reference to a designated
	number of shares of Common Stock (in which case they are referred to as performance shares) or by reference to a designated amount of property, including cash (in which case they are referred to as performance units). Performance awards may be
	settled by delivery of cash, shares or other property, or any combination of those things, as determined by the committee. Performance awards granted to persons whom the committee expects will, for the year in which a deduction arises, be
	covered employees (as defined below) will, if and to the extent intended by the committee, be subject to provisions that should qualify those awards as performance-based compensation not subject to the limitation on tax
	deductibility by us under section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). For purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, the term covered employee means our chief executive officer and each other
	person whose compensation is required to be disclosed in the companys filings with the SEC by reason of the employee being among our most highly-compensated officers for the taxable year (other than our chief financial officer), and such other
	persons as need to be considered a covered employee pursuant to section 162(m). If and to the extent required under section 162(m) of the Code, any power or authority relating to a performance award intended to qualify under section 162(m) of
	the Code is to be exercised by the committee and not the Board.


	If and to the extent that the committee determines that these provisions
	of the Plan are to be applicable to any award, one or more of the following business criteria for us and our subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, and/or for any of our subsidiaries or affiliates, or for business or geographical units of us and/or
	any of our subsidiaries or affiliates (except with respect to the total stockholder return and earnings per share criteria), will be used by the committee in establishing performance goals for awards under the Plan: (1) earnings per share;
	(2) revenues or margins; (3) cash flow; (4) operating margin; (5) return on net assets, investment, capital or equity; (6) economic value added; (7) direct contribution; (8) net income; pretax earnings; earnings
	before interest and taxes; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; earnings after interest expense and before extraordinary or special items; operating income; income before interest income or expense, unusual items and
	income taxes, local, state or federal and excluding budgeted and actual bonuses which might be paid under any ongoing bonus plans of the company; (9) working capital; (10) management of fixed costs or variable costs;
	(11) identification or consummation of investment opportunities or completion of specified projects in accordance with corporate business plans, including strategic mergers, acquisitions or divestitures; (12) total stockholder return;
	(13) debt reduction; (14) market share; (15) entry into new markets, either geographically or

	by business unit; (16) customer retention and satisfaction; and (17) strategic plan development and implementation, including turnaround plans. Any of the above goals may be determined
	on an absolute or relative basis (

	e.g.

	, growth in earnings per share) or as compared to the performance of a published or special index deemed applicable by the committee including, but not limited to, the Standard & Poors 500
	Stock Index or a group of companies that are comparable to us. The committee will exclude the impact of an event or occurrence which the committee determines should appropriately be excluded, including without limitation (i) restructurings,
	discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other unusual or

	non-recurring

	charges, (ii) an event either not directly related to our operations or not within our managements reasonable control
	or (iii) a change in accounting standards required by generally accepted accounting principles. To the extent a performance-based award is made to a covered employee and intended to comply with the provisions of section 162(m) of the Code, the
	committee will select section 162(m)-compliant performance goals for such performance-based awards.


	In determining the payout of any
	performance awards, the committee may use its discretion to decrease the amount payable pursuant to a performance award but, for awards to covered employees subject to section 162(m) of the Code, cannot increase the payout of any performance awards.


	The composition of the committee meets the requirements of section 162(m) of the Code, and the committee determinations with respect to
	performance awards are documented in the certification required for the performance awards to qualify as performance based compensation under section 162(m) of the Code.




	Other Terms of Awards




	Awards may be settled in the form of cash, shares of Common Stock, other awards or other property, in the discretion of the committee, and may
	be made in a single payment or transfer, in installments or on a deferred basis. The committee may make provision for the payment or crediting of interest on installment or deferred payments or the grant or credit of dividend equivalents or other
	amounts in respect of installment or deferred payments denominated in shares of Common Stock. The committee may condition any payment relating to an award on the withholding of taxes and may provide that a portion of any shares of Common Stock or
	other property to be distributed will be withheld (or previously acquired shares of Common Stock or other property be surrendered by the participant) to satisfy withholding and other tax obligations. Awards granted under the Plan generally may not
	be pledged or otherwise encumbered and are not transferable except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution, or to a designated beneficiary upon the participants death, except that the committee may, in its discretion, permit
	transfers for estate planning or other purposes subject to any applicable restrictions under Rule

	16b-3.



	Awards under the Plan are generally granted without a requirement that the recipient pay consideration in the form of cash or property for the
	grant (as distinguished from the exercise), except to the extent required by law. The committee may, however, grant awards in exchange for other awards under the Plan, awards under other company plans, or other rights to payment from the company,
	and may grant awards in addition to and in tandem with other rights or awards.




	Acceleration of Vesting; Change in Control




	The committee may provide in an award agreement, or otherwise determine, that upon a change in control as defined in
	the Plan, (i) options and stock appreciation rights that previously were not vested or exercisable become immediately exercisable, or (ii) that any restrictions applicable to restricted stock, deferred stock or other stock based awards
	immediately lapse. In addition, the committee may provide in an award agreement that the performance goals relating to any performance award will be deemed to have been met upon the occurrence of any change in control.

	Amendment and Termination




	The Board may amend, alter, suspend, discontinue or terminate the Plan or the committees authority to grant awards without further
	stockholder approval, except that stockholder approval must be obtained for any amendment or alteration if that approval is required by law or regulation or under the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our shares of Common
	Stock are then listed or quoted. Thus, stockholder approval may not necessarily be required for every amendment to the Plan which might increase the cost of the Plan or alter the eligibility of persons to receive awards. Stockholder approval will
	not be deemed to be required under laws or regulations, such as those relating to ISOs, that condition favorable treatment of participants on such approval, although the Board may, in its discretion, seek stockholder approval in any circumstance in
	which it deems such approval advisable. Unless earlier terminated by the Board, the Plan will terminate at the earliest of (a) when no shares of Common Stock remain available for issuance under the Plan, (b) termination of the Plan by the
	Board or (c) the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the Plan. Awards outstanding upon expiration of the Plan will remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated, or have expired.




	Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences of Awards




	The following is a summary of material U.S. federal income tax considerations relating to the Plan. The summary is based on U.S. federal income
	tax laws and regulations presently in effect, which are subject to change, possibly retroactively. Tax laws are complex and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality. This discussion does not purport to be a
	complete description of the U.S. federal income tax aspects of the Plan and does not address state, local or foreign tax consequences. All participants in the Plan are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal, state, local,
	and foreign income and other tax consequences of participating in the Plan based on the participants personal circumstances.




	Nonqualified Stock Options




	Under the Code, the grant of a nonqualified stock option is generally not taxable to the optionee. On exercise of a nonqualified stock option
	granted under the Plan, an optionee will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price. The optionees tax basis in those shares will be equal to their fair market
	value on the date of exercise of the option, and the optionees holding period for those shares will begin on that date. Upon an optionees sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a nonqualified stock option, any difference
	between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the date when the stock option was exercised will be treated as long-term or short-term capital gain or loss.


	If an optionee pays for shares of stock on exercise of an option by delivering shares of Common Stock, the optionee will not recognize gain or
	loss on the shares delivered, even if the fair market value of such shares differs from the optionees tax basis in such shares. The optionee, however, will be taxed on the exercise of the option in the manner described above as if he had paid
	the exercise price in cash. The tax basis of the shares received upon exercise will be the tax basis of the shares delivered as payment, share for share, to the extent the number of shares received equals the number of shares delivered as payment.
	In addition, the holding period of the shares received will include the holding period of the shares delivered as payment. The optionees tax basis and holding period for any shares received in excess of the number of shares delivered by the
	optionee will be the same as if the optionee had exercised the option solely in exchange for cash.


	Upon an optionees exercise of a
	nonqualified stock option, the Company or the applicable subsidiary will generally be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes at such time and in the same amount recognized as ordinary income to the optionee, subject to the
	possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.

	Incentive Stock Options




	The Plan provides for the grant of stock options that qualify as incentive stock options (ISOs) as defined in section 422 of the
	Code. Under the Code, an optionee generally is not subject to tax upon the grant or exercise of an ISO. In addition, if the optionee holds a share of stock received on exercise of an ISO for at least two years from the date the option was granted
	and at least one year from the date the option was exercised (the Required Holding Period), the difference, if any, between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that share and the holders tax basis in that
	share will be long-term capital gain or loss.


	If, however, an optionee disposes of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an ISO before
	the end of the Required Holding Period, (a Disqualifying Disposition) the optionee generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of the Disqualifying Disposition equal to the excess, if any, of the fair market value of the share
	on the date the ISO was exercised (or, if less, the amount realized on such Disqualifying Disposition) over the exercise price. If the amount realized on a Disqualifying Disposition exceeds the fair market value of the share on the date of exercise
	of the option, the excess gain recognized will be short-term or long-term capital gain, depending upon the length of time the shares have been held after the date of exercise.


	If an optionee exercises an ISO by delivering shares of stock acquired by an earlier exercise of an ISO, and the previously acquired shares
	have not been held for the Required Holding Period, the optionee will recognize ordinary income on the Disqualifying Disposition.


	For
	purposes of the alternative minimum tax, the amount by which the fair market value of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an ISO exceeds the exercise price of that option generally will be an adjustment included in the optionees
	alternative minimum taxable income for the year in which the option is exercised. If, however, there is a Disqualifying Disposition of the share in the year in which the option is exercised, there will be no adjustment with respect to that share. If
	there is a Disqualifying Disposition in a later year, no income with respect to the Disqualifying Disposition is included in the optionees alternative minimum taxable income for that year.


	The Company is not entitled to take a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes with respect to the grant or exercise of an incentive
	stock option or the disposition of a share acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option after the Required Holding Period. However, if there is a Disqualifying Disposition of a share, the Company is entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to
	the ordinary income includible in income by the optionee, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company
	effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.




	Restricted Stock




	Generally, the recipient of a stock award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the stock is received equal to the excess, if
	any, of the fair market value of the stock received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock. If, however, the stock is not vested when it is received under the Plan (for example, if the employee is required to work for a
	period of time in order to have the right to sell the stock), the recipient generally will not recognize income until the stock becomes vested, at which time the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess, if any, of
	the fair market value of the stock on the date it becomes vested over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock. A recipient may, however, file a section 83(b) election with the Internal Revenue Service, within 30 days
	of his or her receipt of the stock award, to recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the shares are awarded in an amount equal to their fair market value at that time, notwithstanding that such share are not vested and may be subsequently
	forfeited. If you make such an election, you will not recognize any additional taxable income at the time the shares become vested, but if the shares are later forfeited, you will not be allowed a tax deduction for the forfeited shares.


	 


	36






	Table of Contents



	The recipients basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition
	of shares acquired as stock awards will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the stock is received or when the stock becomes vested. Upon the disposition of any stock received as a stock award under the
	Plan, the difference between the sales price and the recipients basis in the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be characterized as long-term capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one
	year from the date as of which he or she would be required to recognize any compensation income.


	The Company will be entitled to a
	deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the recipient, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives
	designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.




	Deferred
	Stock




	A participant who receives an award of deferred stock will generally not recognize any income on the grant of such award.
	However, the participant will recognize ordinary compensation income on the receipt of the actual stock equal to the fair market value of the stock received. If at the time of transfer, the stock received is subject to a substantial risk of
	forfeiture, the tax treatment will be the same as the tax treatment of Restricted Stock, as discussed above.


	The Company will be entitled
	to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the recipient, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives
	designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.




	Other
	Stock Awards




	The U.S. federal income tax consequences of any other stock awards will depend upon the specific facts and
	circumstances of each award, including, in particular, the nature of any restrictions imposed with respect to the awards.




	Bonus
	Stock and Awards in Lieu of Obligations




	A participant who receives a stock payment in lieu of a cash payment that would otherwise
	have been made will generally be taxed as if the cash payment has been received, and the Company generally will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount.




	Performance-based Awards




	A participant who has been granted a performance-based award generally will not recognize taxable income at the time of grant, and the Company
	will not be entitled to a deduction for U.S. federal income tax purposes at that time. When an award is paid, whether in cash or shares of Common Stock, the participant generally will recognize ordinary income, and the Company will be entitled to a
	corresponding deduction. The recipients tax basis in any shares acquired pursuant to a performance-based award is the amount recognized by him or her as income attributable to such shares. Upon a subsequent disposition of the shares, the
	recipient will generally realize a capital gain or loss, as applicable.




	Stock Appreciation Rights




	The Company may grant stock appreciation rights (SARs) separate from any other award or in tandem with options under the Plan.
	Generally, the recipient of an SAR will not recognize any taxable income at the time


	 


	37






	Table of Contents



	the SAR is granted. When the SAR is exercised, the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the SARs in cash and such cash will be taxable as ordinary compensation income to the recipient
	at the time that the cash is received. If the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the SARs in shares of stock, the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock on the day
	it is received over any amounts paid by the recipient for the stock. The Company will be entitled to a deduction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the amount recognized by the recipient as ordinary income, subject to the
	possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.


	SARs may be issued in tandem with a stock option. Under this type of arrangement, the exercise of a SAR will result in the cancellation of an
	option, and the exercise of an option will result in a cancellation of a SAR. If the recipient of a tandem SAR elects to surrender the underlying option in exchange for cash or shares of stock equal to the appreciation inherent in the underlying
	option, the tax consequences to the recipient will be the same as discussed above relating to the SARs. If the recipient elects to exercise the underlying option, the holder will be taxed at the time of exercise as if he or she had exercised a
	nonqualified stock option, as previously discussed above. As a result, the recipient will recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the then fair market value of the shares of stock over the exercise price.




	Dividend Equivalents




	Generally, the recipient of a dividend equivalent award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the dividend equivalent award
	is received equal to the fair market value of the amount received. The company generally will be entitled to a deduction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the employee is required to recognize as a
	result of the dividend equivalent award, subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under Sections 280G and 162(m) of the Code for compensation paid to executives designated in those Sections, and provided that the Company effects
	withholding with respect to the deemed compensation.




	Tax Withholding




	Ordinary income recognized in connection with the receipt or exercise of an award under the Plan is subject to income and employment tax wage
	withholding, unless the participant is not an employee of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate. The Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate, may deduct from all payments made under the Plan, an amount (which may include shares of Common
	Stock) to satisfy any federal, state, local or foreign withholding obligations with respect to any award.




	Section 409A of the Code




	Section 409A of the Code governs the taxation of deferred compensation. Awards received under the Plan are intended to be exempt
	from the requirements of Section 409A where possible. However, there can be no assurance that awards designed to be exempt from Section 409A will in fact be exempt. An award that is subject to Section 409A and fails to satisfy its requirements will
	subject the holder of the award to immediate taxation, an interest penalty and an additional 20% tax on the amount underlying the award.




	Section 162 Limitations




	In general, under Section 162(m) of the Code, income tax deductions of publicly-held corporations may be limited to the extent total
	compensation for certain executive officers exceeds $1,000,000 in any one year. Under Section 162(m), the deduction limit does not apply to certain performance-based compensation established by an independent compensation committee that
	is adequately disclosed to, and approved by, stockholders. In particular, stock options will satisfy the performance-based compensation exception if the awards are made by

	Table of Contents



	a qualifying compensation committee, the Plan sets the maximum number of shares that can be granted to any person within a specified period, the compensation is based solely on an increase in the
	stock price after the grant date, and certain other requirements are met. The Company has attempted to structure the Plan in such a manner that the remuneration attributable to stock options and other awards which meet the requirements of Section
	162(m) will not be subject to the $1,000,000 limitation. The Company has not, however, requested a ruling from the IRS or an opinion of counsel regarding this issue


	.






	Section 280G of the Code




	Under certain circumstances, the accelerated vesting or exercise of options or the accelerated lapse of restrictions on stock awards in
	connection with a change in control could be deemed an excess parachute payment for purposes of the parachute tax provisions of Section 280G of the Code. In that event, the grantee could be subject to a 20% excise tax and the Company or
	applicable subsidiary could be denied a tax deduction with respect to a portion of the grants.




	Importance of Consulting Tax Adviser





	The information set forth above is a summary only and does not purport to be complete. In addition, the information is based
	upon current U.S. federal income tax rules and therefore is subject to change when those rules change. Moreover, because the tax consequences to any recipient may depend on his or her particular situation, each recipient should consult his or her
	tax adviser as to the Federal, state, local and other tax consequences of the grant or exercise of an award or the disposition of stock acquired as a result of an award.

	PROPOSAL FIVE
	 RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTING FIRM





	Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm




	On April 10, 2017, the Board unanimously approved the Audit Committees recommendation to appoint BDO USA, LLP (BDO) as
	the Companys independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, and directed that the selection of BDO be submitted to the stockholders for ratification at the Annual Meeting. Although the Company
	is not required to submit the selection of independent registered public accountants for stockholder approval, if the stockholders do not ratify this selection, the Board may reconsider its selection of BDO. The Board considers BDO to be well
	qualified to serve as the independent auditors for the Company; however, even if the selection is ratified, the Board may direct the appointment of a different independent registered public accounting firm at any time during the current or
	subsequent fiscal year if the Audit Committee and Board determine that the change would be in the Companys best interests.

	Pre-Approval

	Policies and Procedures




	Our Audit Committee has a policy in place that requires its review and

	pre-approval

	of all audit and
	permissible

	non-audit

	services provided by our independent auditors. The services requiring

	pre-approval

	by the audit committee may include audit services, audit-related
	services, tax services and other services. The

	pre-approval

	requirement is waived with respect to the provision of

	non-audit

	services if (i) the aggregate amount of
	all such

	non-audit

	services provided to us constitutes not more than 5% of the total amount of revenues paid by us to our independent auditors during the fiscal year in which such

	non-audit

	services were provided, (ii) such services were not recognized at the time of the engagement to be

	non-audit

	services, and (iii) such services are promptly
	brought to the attention of the Audit Committee or by one or more of its members to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee. All audit-related services, tax services and all other services provided by BDO are

	pre-approved

	by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has considered and determined that the provision of all

	non-audit

	services set forth in the table above is
	compatible with maintaining BDOs independence.




	Attendance at Annual Meeting




	Representatives of BDO intend to be present at the Annual Meeting and will be available to respond to questions.
