Investment Strategies



Private EquitySpotlightPortfolioSpecial SituationsPerforming Credit




Littlejohn’s investment platform is focused on our integrated core strategies—private equity and credit. Each strategy employs the same disciplined investment philosophy, and we seek to capitalize on the related synergies. This approach is particularly powerful in the middle market.

Private Equity
investments that Littlejohn targets range from solid performing
middle market companies, to complicated corporate carve-outs, to
businesses facing operating difficulties, inadequate capital
resources or an inability to drive growth.  Littlejohn focuses
on a limited number of situations and looks to develop a strong
partnership with management to drive a step-change in growth,
performance, and enterprise value.
Special Situations
that the Fund will consider include leveraged loans, second lien
debt, mezzanine debt, high yield bonds, equities, and related
securities, and obligations of leveraged or financially distressed
companies and/or other special situations. A key element of the
Firm's investment strategy with respect to Distressed Investments
is to become active in the restructuring process in order to drive
increases in enterprise value for all company stakeholders.
Performing
Credit  investments are generally investments
in secured term loan obligations of non-investment grade corporate
borrowers.  These investments are in loans to borrowers not
experiencing financial distress that are rated and sourced by
Littlejohn in the broadly syndicated loan market. 
Investments focus on generating income while avoiding credit
losses.

        Littlejohn & Co. | Our Story
    























Our StoryInvestment Strategies








Our Story



Building ValueLeadership




Littlejohn utilizes its unique culture and capabilities to make transformative equity and debt investments in a broad range of middle market companies. We complement this effort through our investments in the performing credit of large corporate borrowers.

The Firm is a private equity and
special situations investor focused on investing in companies
through all economic cycles.  The Firm has a long track record
of successfully investing in the middle market where it can help
management teams to drive meaningful improvements in strategy,
growth, and operations.
Littlejohn has always invested
exclusively in middle market companies, which it defines as
businesses, with revenues typically between $100M and $800M. 
The companies we invest in are all facing the opportunities and
challenges of significant change, and we partner with management to
transform these businesses.  Our approach includes:

Expand All | Collapse All

Transforming good companies into great companies












Littlejohn has extensive experience
in partnering with management teams who are leading companies with
solid performance at the time of the transaction. We work with
management to drive a step-change in sustainable growth and
operating performance through both organic initiatives and
strategic acquisitions.








Carving out divisions of large corporations












Littlejohn has acquired many
operating divisions from some of the world's most well-known
multinational corporations.  We have deep experience in
managing an efficient and confidential acquisition process,
negotiating and performing appropriate transition arrangements, and
executing the carve-out to minimize disruption for the parent while
maximizing the potential of the newly independent
business. 








Operational and financial restructurings












Littlejohn has a unique perspective
on companies dealing with financial and operational distress. 
We have deep experience dealing with the complicated and often
contentious, multi-party financial restructuring process.
 Given our experience in building long term value at our
companies, however, we focus beyond short-sighted recovery actions
in order to rebuild corporate momentum and maximize enterprise
value for the benefit of all stakeholders.








Rescue financings












Littlejohn's primary goal in
structured capital transactions is to deliver a solution that
provides business owners and management with the liquidity, time,
and capital for success.  In these situations, however,
Littlejohn looks to bring more to the table than capital.  Our
culture and experience in working closely with management teams to
drive long-term commercial and operational success differentiates
us from many players in structured capital investments.








Distressed securities investing












Littlejohn takes positions in the
securities of stressed and distressed middle market
companies.  We do this with an eye toward taking a leadership
role in working with management and all other stakeholders to craft
a financial solution that provides adequate "runway" for long term
strategic recovery and growth.








Performing credit investing












Littlejohn makes investments in performing debt instruments,
principally syndicated leveraged loans of corporate
borrowers.  Through active portfolio management, we seek to
generate attractive risk adjusted returns through a combination of
current income, capital appreciation and preservation of
principal.

Littlejohn & Co. Announces Final Close of $650 million Fund III
May 4, 2005

GREENWICH, CT, May 4, 2005 --
Littlejohn & Co., a private investment firm that applies an
operational approach to building middle market companies, today
announced that it has completed the final closing of Littlejohn
Fund III, L.P. with capital commitments of $650 million. The firm
was targeting $600 million in limited partner commitments, but
placed a hard cap of $650 million on Fund III after finding itself
significantly oversubscribed.
Littlejohn Fund III is the firm's
largest fund to date, and together with two other funds raised
since inception in 1996, aggregates a total of approximately $1.4
billion of capital under management. Littlejohn will continue to
implement its operationally oriented investment approach as with
its two predecessor funds and target companies that are
underperforming their potential due to the lack of management
resources, capital or experiencing market changes.
"We are extremely pleased with the
overwhelming success of our fundraising effort to have exceeded our
expectations," said Angus Littlejohn, Chairman and CEO of
Littlejohn & Co. "We are gratified by the market's response and
to have completed a very quick fund raising process largely based
on the strength of our existing associations. Our Fund has the
representation of investors from around the world who see value in
our ability to develop businesses through operational enhancements
and our team remains focused on the opportunities where we can add
value."
Investors in existing and past
Littlejohn funds have included some of the leading public and
corporate pension funds, endowments, and domestic and foreign
insurance companies and fund of funds. The firm's marketing of Fund
III was limited to existing Fund II investors as well as investors
with which it had longstanding communications. Littlejohn did not
use a placement agent in the marketing of Fund III. Littlejohn
closed on its inaugural fund, the Littlejohn Direct Investment
Program, in 1997 with $205 million in commitments. The second,
Littlejohn Fund II, LP was closed in 2000 with committed capital of
$530 million from limited partners.
"We made tremendous progress last
year in enhancing the operations of our portfolio investments,"
said Michael Klein, President of Littlejohn. "We have been
successful at building stand alone companies from corporate spin
offs and believe that there are additional investment opportunities
for us as restructuring continues both in the U.S. and Europe."
In addition to Angus Littlejohn and
Michael Klein, the Littlejohn team includes two other partners;
Edmund Feeley and Brian Ramsay, as well as eight additional
investment professionals. Among the firm's more recent investments
is the acquisition of the Aeronautics business of General dynamics
by Littlejohn's portfolio company Wyle Laboratories.

Co., LLC is a private equity firm that makes control equity
investments in mid-sized companies that can benefit from its

History[edit]
JLL traces its roots back to Gilliam Joseph & Littlejohn, a merchant bank founded in 1987 by William J. Gilliam, Peter A. Joseph and Angus C. Littlejohn Jr.[2] The three founders met in the mid-1980s at the Quadrex Corporation, a small New York brokerage. They initially leased their office space from Bennett S. LeBow, a 1980s corporate raider and fellow Drexel Burnham Lambert client. At Quadrex, Gilliam, the youngest of the three, managed the mergers and acquisitions unit, and the other two reported to him. After a series of successful investments, the three decided to leave Quadrex and set up their own small private equity firm. In 1988, Paul S. Levy, formerly a managing director, at Drexel Burnham Lambert who focused on corporate restructurings and exchange offers, was recruited to join the firm, which was renamed Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. Levy helped his new partners secure $150 million of capital for buyout transactions from his former firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
JLL experienced an early success with the leveraged buyout of Rexene Corp, a Texas-based chemical company, which made the partners multi-millionaires. Gilliam would eventually set up his own small investment firm Gilliam & Company to focus on investments in chemicals and plastics and would serve as chairman of Rexene. In 1991, Gilliam, faced a similar falling out with the board of Rexene and abruptly resigned.[3]
JLL's investment funds have experienced mixed results. According to data from Private Equity Intelligence, JLL Partners Fund III and V have proven to be top-performing for their respective vintage years, however funds I and IV were slightly below the median for their vintage years and the returns on fund II were in the bottom quartile of 1994 vintage funds.
In 1996, Angus Littlejohn resigned from Joseph Littlejohn & Levy to form a new private investment firm, Littlejohn & Co. The following year, in 1998, Peter Joseph left and joined Palladium Equity Partners, a middle-market private equity firm with a specialization in investments in the U.S. Hispanic market and also in Mexico, Spain, and Brazil, founded the prior year.
In 2002, after a lengthy and difficult fund-raising process, the rechristened "JLL Partners" was able to close a new private equity fund, JLL Partners Fund IV LP., with $750 million of investor commitments, representing a 25% decrease from its previous fund.[4][5]
Funds raised[edit]
Since its founding, JLL has raised six private equity funds with investor commitments totaling $7.2 billion:

1989 — Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Fund I ($221 million)
1994 — Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Fund II ($400 million)
1998 — JLL Partners Fund III ($1.0 billion, first fund raised after departure of Joseph and Littlejohn)
2002 — JLL Partners Fund IV ($751 million)
2005 — JLL Partners Fund V ($1.5 billion)
2008 — JLL Partners Fund VI ($3.3 billion, currently in fundraising)

History[edit]
JLL traces its roots back to Gilliam Joseph & Littlejohn, a merchant bank founded in 1987 by William J. Gilliam, Peter A. Joseph and Angus C. Littlejohn Jr.[2] The three founders met in the mid-1980s at the Quadrex Corporation, a small New York brokerage. They initially leased their office space from Bennett S. LeBow, a 1980s corporate raider and fellow Drexel Burnham Lambert client. At Quadrex, Gilliam, the youngest of the three, managed the mergers and acquisitions unit, and the other two reported to him. After a series of successful investments, the three decided to leave Quadrex and set up their own small private equity firm. In 1988, Paul S. Levy, formerly a managing director, at Drexel Burnham Lambert who focused on corporate restructurings and exchange offers, was recruited to join the firm, which was renamed Gilliam Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. Levy helped his new partners secure $150 million of capital for buyout transactions from his former firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert.
JLL experienced an early success with the leveraged buyout of Rexene Corp, a Texas-based chemical company, which made the partners multi-millionaires. Gilliam would eventually set up his own small investment firm Gilliam & Company to focus on investments in chemicals and plastics and would serve as chairman of Rexene. In 1991, Gilliam, faced a similar falling out with the board of Rexene and abruptly resigned.[3]
JLL's investment funds have experienced mixed results. According to data from Private Equity Intelligence, JLL Partners Fund III and V have proven to be top-performing for their respective vintage years, however funds I and IV were slightly below the median for their vintage years and the returns on fund II were in the bottom quartile of 1994 vintage funds.
In 1996, Angus Littlejohn resigned from Joseph Littlejohn & Levy to form a new private investment firm, Littlejohn & Co. The following year, in 1998, Peter Joseph left and joined Palladium Equity Partners, a middle-market private equity firm with a specialization in investments in the U.S. Hispanic market and also in Mexico, Spain, and Brazil, founded the prior year.
In 2002, after a lengthy and difficult fund-raising process, the rechristened "JLL Partners" was able to close a new private equity fund, JLL Partners Fund IV LP., with $750 million of investor commitments, representing a 25% decrease from its previous fund.[4][5]
Funds raised[edit]
Since its founding, JLL has raised six private equity funds with investor commitments totaling $7.2 billion:

1989 — Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Fund I ($221 million)
1994 — Joseph Littlejohn & Levy Fund II ($400 million)
1998 — JLL Partners Fund III ($1.0 billion, first fund raised after departure of Joseph and Littlejohn)
2002 — JLL Partners Fund IV ($751 million)
2005 — JLL Partners Fund V ($1.5 billion)
2008 — JLL Partners Fund VI ($3.3 billion, currently in fundraising)
