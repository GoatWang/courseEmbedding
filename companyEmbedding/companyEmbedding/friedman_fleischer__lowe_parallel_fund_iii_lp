Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D
This Amendment No. 2 amends and supplements the Schedule 13D filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on October 13, 2015, as amended by the Schedule 13D/A filed with the SEC on November 7, 2016 (the “Schedule 13D”). Except as set forth herein, the Schedule 13D is unmodified and remains in full force and effect. Each capitalized term used but not defined herein has the meaning ascribed to such term in the Schedule 13D.
This Amendment No. 2 amends Item 5 as set forth below. The filing of this Amendment No. 2 represents the final amendment to the Schedule 13D and constitutes an exit filing for the Reporting Persons.
Item 5.          Interest in Securities of the Issuer
Items 5(a) and (c) of the Schedule 13D are hereby amended and restated as follows:
(a) In the aggregate, the Reporting Persons beneficially own 973,988 shares of Common Stock, constituting approximately 2.9% of the issued and outstanding Common Stock, which consists of 571,800 shares of Common Stock held by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe Capital Partners III, L.P., 378,924 shares of Common Stock held by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe Parallel Fund III, L.P., 12,113 shares of Common Stock held by FFL Individual Partners III, L.P. and 11,151 shares of Common Stock held by FFL Executive Partners III, L.P. The FFL Funds are controlled by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe GP III, L.P., their general partner, which is controlled by Friedman Fleischer & Lowe GP III, LLC, its general partner.
All ownership percentages of the securities reporting in this Schedule 13D are based upon 33,424,524 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of October 31, 2016, as reported on the Company’s Quarterly Report filed on Form 10-Q for the period ending September 30, 2016, as filed with the SEC on November 7, 2016.
(c) Information concerning transactions in the shares of Common Stock effected by the Reporting Persons since the filing of Amendment No. 1 to the Schedule 13D is set forth in Annex A hereto and is incorporated herein by reference. All of the transactions in shares of Common Stock listed in Annex A hereto were effected in the open market or through a brokered block trade.
(e) As a result of the transactions described on Annex A hereto, on November 18, 2016, each of the Reporting Persons ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of the outstanding Common Stock.

Availability of CRA Public Evaluations
The Community Reinvestment Act is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  It was enacted by the Congress in 1977 (12 U.S.C. 2901) and is implemented by Regulation BB (12 CFR 228).  The regulation was revised in May 1995.

The CRA requires that each depository institution's record in helping meet the credit needs of its entire community be evaluated periodically.  That record is taken into account in considering an institution's application for deposit facilities.

A copy of an institution's CRA evaluation may be obtained directly from the institution or Reserve Bank.

Federal bank regulators use the following performance levels to rate an institution's performance under CRA:

O = Outstanding
S = Satisfactory
NI = Needs to improve
SN = Substantial noncompliance

The following state member banks have been examined and their CRA public evaluations are now available.
