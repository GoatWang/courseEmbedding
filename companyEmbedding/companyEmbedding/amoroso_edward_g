Description

                    Cyber Attacks takes the national debate on protecting critical infrastructure in an entirely new and fruitful direction. It initiates an intelligent national (and international) dialogue amongst the general technical community around proper methods for reducing national risk. This includes controversial themes such as the deliberate use of deception to trap intruders. It also serves as an attractive framework for a new national strategy for cyber security, something that several Presidential administrations have failed in attempting to create. In addition, nations other than the US might choose to adopt the framework as well. This book covers cyber security policy development for massively complex infrastructure using ten principles derived from experiences in U.S. Federal Government settings and a range of global commercial environments. It provides a unique and provocative philosophy of cyber security that directly contradicts conventional wisdom about info sec for small or enterprise-level systems. It illustrates the use of practical, trial-and-error findings derived from 25 years of hands-on experience protecting critical infrastructure on a daily basis at AT&T. Each principle is presented as a separate security strategy, along with pages of compelling examples that demonstrate use of the principle. Cyber Attacks will be of interest to security professionals tasked with protection of critical infrastructure and with cyber security; CSOs and other top managers; government and military security specialists and policymakers; security managers; and students in cybersecurity and international security programs.show more

Review quote

                            "Amoroso's advice takes the art out of the debate onwhether security is art or science. He brings a high level goal oriented approach to practical situations in order for the `right' security decisions to appear obvious to the reader. However, no book is a single solution, and this one is no exception. Some readers may be disappointed not to find comprehensive references for further reading. It is apparent that the book surveys a great deal of literature, but there is no bibliography. Readers may also be disappointed that there is no step-by-step guaranteed path to cyber security solutions. The book provides no procedures or checklists. Nevertheless, those who allow Amoroso to influence their view of the security problem at the level he chooses to present it should more easily be able to recognize cyber security solutions."--Computers and Security "Ed Amoroso has again given the policy community a thoughtful roadmap. Cyberthreats are becoming more sophisticated, but thankfully Ed is well abreast of the problem and leading with solutions."-John Hamre, Deputy Secretary of Defense (1997-2000), president and CEO of the Center for Strategic and Informational Studies, Washington, DC "Dr. Amoroso's fifth book Cyber Attacks: Protecting National Infrastructure outlines the challenges of protecting our nation's infrastructure from cyber attack using security techniques established to protect much smaller and less complex environments.  He proposes a brand new type of national infrastructure protection methodology and outlines a strategy presented as a series of ten basic design and operations principles ranging from deception to response.  The bulk of the text covers each of these principles in technical detail.  While several of these principles would be daunting to implement and practice they provide the first clear and concise framework for discussion of this critical challenge.   This text is thought-provoking and should be a `must read' for anyone concerned with cybersecurity in the private or government sector."-Clayton W. Naeve, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, Endowed Chair in Bioinformatics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN "Dr. Ed Amoroso reveals in plain English the threats and weaknesses of our critical infrastructure balanced against practices that reduce the exposures.  This is an excellent guide to the understanding of the cyber-scape that the security professional navigates.  The book takes complex concepts of security and simplifies it into coherent and simple to understand concepts."-Arnold Felberbaum, Chief IT Security & Compliance Officer, Reed Elsevier "The national infrastructure, which is now vital to communication, commerce and entertainment in everyday life, is highly vulnerable to malicious attacks and terrorist threats. Today, it is possible for botnets to penetrate millions of computers around the world in few minutes, and to attack the valuable national infrastructure.  "As the New York Times reported, the growing number of threats by botnets suggests that this cyber security issue has become a serious problem, and we are losing the war against these attacks.  "While computer security technologies will be useful for network systems, the reality tells us that this conventional approach is not effective enough for the complex, large-scale national infrastructure.  "Not only does the author provide comprehensive methodologies based on 25 years of experience in cyber security at AT&T, but he also suggests `security through obscurity,' which attempts to use secrecy to provide security." -Byeong Gi Lee, President, IEEE Communications Society, and Commissioner of the Korea Communications Commission (KCC) "Amoroso has laid the much needed foundation for a solid Critical Infrastructure plan. Security professionals now have the basis to apply his ideas to solve an incredibly complex problem. "-Howard Israel, Corporate Security Officer, Fidessa Corporation "Cyber Attacks: Protecting National Infrastructure is a captivating journey through cyber security policy development for complex infrastructures by one of today's foremost experts on large-scale network security. It is a must read technological roadmap for anyone interested in what we must do to strengthen our national network security systems."-Ken Xie, CEO, Fortinet, Inc.  "Some of his ideas are controversial and bound to incite debates about privacy and practice. For instance in his book, Cyber Attacks: Protecting National Infrastructure,"  Amoroso suggests using large-scale and coordinated collection of network-traffic data as well as security information from end-user desktops to pinpoint botnet-compromised computers, identify suspicious anomalies and trace attack paths."--Network World Magazine "In his new book Cyber Attacks: Protecting National Infrastructure, Amoroso takes a hard look at common information security practices that have failed to protect individuals, organizations, and ultimately US critical infrastructure. Amoroso offers a new way of looking at information security and some "common sense" strategies to thwart cyberattackers, who are becoming more sophisticated, organized, and advanced."--Infosecurity Magazine (an Elsevier publication) "Amoroso offers a technical, architectural, and management solution to the problem of protecting national infrastructure. This includes practical and empirically-based guidance for security engineers, network operators, software designers, technology managers, application developers, and even those who simply use computing technology ikn their work or home. Each principle is presented as a separate security strategy, along with pages of compelling examples that demonstrate use of the principle. A specific set of criteria requirements allows any organization, such as a government agency, to integrate the principles into their local environment.... The book takes the national debate on protecting critical infrastructure in an entirely new and fruitful direction."--The Journal of Law Enforcement, Spring 2011 "What sets this effort apart is that it offers a comprehensive list of local enterprise-level suggestion and remedies as well as a plan that is scalable to protect national level infrastructure.  What's more, the material is well-written and concisely presented.  The author sets out his plan in sufficient detail but without miring the reader in technical details...I highly recommend this book for all intermediate-level and above security practitioners in IT and non-IT positions."--Security Management Magazine, September 2011, p. 168show more

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
