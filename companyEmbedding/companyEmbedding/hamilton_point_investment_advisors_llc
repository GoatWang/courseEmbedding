The HP Difference & FAQ



The Hamilton Point Difference
Because we are not affiliated with any banks, brokerage firms, or insurance companies, Hamilton Point is able to focus exclusively on managing money and not on selling insurance, annuities or other financial “products.”  As a registered investment advisor, our legal and fiduciary obligation is to put the interests of our clients first.  The firm’s principals align their interests with those of their clients by “eating their own cooking”, i.e. the firm’s principals manage their personal portfolios in the same fashion as Hamilton Point does for clients.
Our boutique size and in-house research allow us to be more selective than large financial institutions that control far more money than we believe can be invested with a high-quality focus.  This problem is often compounded by an excessive marketing and investment focus on benchmarks by industry participants.   At Hamilton Point, our foremost concern is the preservation of capital — not benchmarks.  We also believe our hybrid approach, which combines individually-purchased securities with selective use of outside managers and funds, is the best way to fulfill the investment objectives of our clients.  Hamilton Point’s approach strives to maximize control over critical factors such as quality, diversification, expenses and, if needed, taxes.
We have built a strong reputation around our firm culture, which emphasizes client service and interaction.   Clients are always serviced by investment professionals, and during business hours calls are answered by a human being – not a machine.  New clients come to our firm almost exclusively from referrals by current clients or professionals (e.g. accountants and attorneys), and we pride ourselves on developing close relationships with all of our clients.  This growth through relationship building allows us to further strive to minimize expenses for clients, since no “middle-man” or salesperson is compensated.

Who are your clients?
Our clients are located in seventeen states, with concentrations in North Carolina, Virginia, and New York, and include high net worth families and non-profit institutions. Among our clients are individuals who have sold businesses, inherited assets, and/or saved money throughout successful careers. Our nonprofit clients look to us for advice in customizing an appropriate investment and spending policy that we implement using in-house research to build high quality, endowment-like, diversified portfolios.

Who does your firm and its clients use for custodial, trading and reporting services?
Hamilton Point’s custodial relationship with Fidelity Investment’s Institutional Wealth Services Group links clients with a partner providing service, support and protection¹. Investments you entrust for Hamilton Point’s management are typically placed in custody of Fidelity’s clearing firm, National Financial Services LLC – one of the largest clearing providers in the industry. Fidelity Investments is a privately-owned firm, founded in 1946, with over $3 trillion in custodial assets. Our relationship with Fidelity gives us access to portfolio trading tools and provides clients with user-friendly online access to their personal accounts. Clients can — and some do — direct us to use custodians other than Fidelity.  Trades are done with Fidelity and with outside brokerages when needed.  Fidelity does not impose an account custodial fee. Their compensation is primarily via commissions/fees earned on the account from trades initiated by Hamilton Point.
Hamilton Point also employs the services of Advent Software for client and account reporting.

What are the fees and expenses involved?
For portfolios of $5,000,000 or less:  1.00% on the first $1,000,000 and 0.75% on the next $4,000,000.  For portfolios of greater than $5,000,000 and less than or equal to $20,000,000, the fee is 0.60% on all assets.  For portfolios of greater than $20,000,000, the fee is 0.50% on all assets.
Many portfolios managed by Hamilton Point have exposure to selected mutual funds (typically around 30%), all of which are no-load and have relatively low expenses.  When evaluating fees, it is important to ensure an appropriate “all-in” expense ratio is reported when comparing advisors.  We believe our utilization of in-house research to individually purchase securities for a majority allocation in most client portfolios, rather than using a pure “manager of managers” or “fund of funds” advisory approach, allows us much greater control over expenses.  We welcome the opportunity to review all expenses associated with a Hamilton Point managed account and compare them with the expenses of other investment options.

Does your firm construct portfolios using individually purchased securities or mutual funds?
The answer is that in most cases we use both.
A fully diversified balanced account will consist primarily of individually purchased securities, including corporate and treasury bonds, up to forty Global Core stocks, and up to thirty Equity Income stocks. These individually purchased securities generally comprise 70% of a client portfolio, and are selected based on in-house research conducted by the firm’s investment team.
Individually purchased securities are typically supplemented by appropriate exposure to selected asset classes using funds. Examples of asset classes accessed through the use of externally-managed funds include inflation-protected bonds, small capitalization equities, and international equities. For smaller accounts, Hamilton Point may use funds exclusively in order to accomplish diversification objectives.  Hamilton Point’s hybrid approach strives for greater control over quality, expenses, and, if needed, tax planning and/or other customized client investment preferences.

What sort of client contact and reporting should clients expect?
For Hamilton Point, listening to clients through regular interaction is a core value. Personal meetings are encouraged at least quarterly, and more frequent communication is welcomed. For daily account management and other inquiries, each client is assigned a member of the investment committee as the primary relationship contact.
For reporting, in addition to being able to view account activity on a daily basis online, clients receive monthly statements from Fidelity or their chosen custodian. Hamilton Point also provides concise summary reports on a quarterly basis to include appraisals, contribution and withdrawals, tax reports, and performance.

Do you provide financial planning services?
Yes, although we provide such services to existing investment clients and do not collect separate fees for services related to financial planning. Collectively, the Hamilton Point team has formal training and substantial experience in nearly all aspects of wealth management. In addition, Nathan Byrd holds the Certified Financial Planner designation, and Rick Woods holds the Certified Private Wealth Advisor designation, both of which are advanced wealth management certification programs.
Planning conversations and in-depth analysis are often a significant part of our highly customized value proposition. We most often work with clients on matters related to the sale of a private company, retirement income forecasting, or tax and estate planning. We have experience working with Annuity Trusts, Charitable Remainder Trusts, Private Foundations, etc. We typically coordinate work with clients’ existing attorneys and CPAs, but can facilitate introductions with other tax and estate planning professionals as needed. Our goal is to help coordinate all aspects of each client’s financial picture, including the components that we do not specifically manage as part of our investment services.
Read more about our holistic approach to wealth management here.

How is performance measured and reported?
Every client has a separate account or accounts, managed on a customized basis, for which we are able to provide performance on both a before and after-fee basis.
In addition, we maintain a performance composite for each of our Global Core Equity, Equity Income, Diversified Equity, and Balanced investment strategies.  A performance composite is an aggregation of actual client portfolios which follow similar investment strategies, objectives, or mandates, and is used to document the performance history of an investment strategy.   Strategy performance reported by Hamilton Point is from our composites and is never hypothetical, back tested, or simulated – a practice which we believe is too common and disingenuous.  Please contact us for more information.

Do you have minimums?
Relationships typically have the ability to be at least $1 million over time, though smaller initial accounts are considered.  Our larger family and non-profit relationships can exceed $30 million.

Investment Philosophy



Hamilton Point manages portfolios on a fee-only basis for individuals and nonprofit organizations. We are an independent, registered investment advisor with a fiduciary responsibility to act in our clients’ best interests at all times.
Our primary objective is to preserve capital, for clients who trust us to identify opportunities to achieve growth in portfolio principal and income over the long term. We believe that our hybrid approach, combining individually-purchased securities with selective use of outside managers, is the best way to fulfill the investment objectives of our clients. The intended result is a high-quality, diversified investment portfolio where clients understand what they own and why.
Most clients engage us to invest their assets on a fully diversified, balanced basis while others prefer a focused portfolio of individually purchased stocks and/or bonds. Portfolios can be highly customized to accommodate low-cost basis securities or other unique considerations.

We serve individuals who have sold businesses, inherited assets and saved money throughout successful careers. We also serve non-profits with endowments to invest.


We have clients in 17 states across the nation, with concentrations in North Carolina, Virginia and New York.


Typically our clients have the potential for investment assets to exceed $1 million over time, though smaller initial accounts are considered; larger relationships exceed $40 million.

We listen carefully as we seek to understand the life circumstances for which each client must plan, and undertake comprehensive, scrupulously monitored management of wealth.

Will Washington Drain the Amazon?Posted Jul 18 2017 by  Andrew Burns  in Newsletter 


In our internet connected world, great ideas and dashes of capitalism are a recipe for rip-roaring increases in revenue, and few compare with Amazon. With Amazon’s proposed purchase of Whole Foods, we assess what investors might be thinking when owning companies producing little in cash profits, often with risks that aren’t immediately apparent. At Hamilton Point we have done well sticking to businesses that produce sufficient cash to justify owning the shares, and Amazon is not one of them. Just-the-same, we mustn’t ignore Amazon’s disruptive approach and its potential effect on investment decisions we make.

Venture a Guess?Posted Mar 27 2017 by  Andrew Burns  in Newsletter 


In the late 1970s, one of your writers started working his first white-collar job at One Wall Street for Irving Trust Company. In this newsletter, we reminisce about a lesson learned at a two-day Irving Trust corporate finance seminar in 1979 that featured expert views on subjects ranging from newfangled money market funds and commercial paper (imagine such exotica!) to deeper topics such as venture capital and buyouts. One lasting and simple concept about investing was discussed and will be recalled here since it has timeless application for any investment opportunity—especially as we witness a spate of so-called “unicorn” Initial Public Offerings, the latest being Snap, Inc. (d.b.a. Snapchat).

The Equity Round TripPosted Dec 21 2016 by  Andrew Burns  in Newsletter 


Many public companies generate more cash from their operations than reasonably needed for future business investments, and an increasing number have been returning excess cash to shareholders via share buybacks. Hamilton Point’s quality-focused investment philosophy leads us to own certain of these publicly-traded companies that are, if you look closely, slowly “going private” by regularly buying back a portion of their shares. The incidence of share repurchases by public companies has been significant in size of late and worth discussing since buybacks can either be a great idea or altogether unwise.

Maybe You Can Drive My CarPosted Sep 26 2016 by  Andrew Burns  in Newsletter 


Recent data revealed that Americans drove just over three trillion miles in 2015, an increase of 3.5% over the prior year. Disturbingly, deaths due to highway accidents rose 7.2% over the same period(1). Paralleling this news is heavy experimentation with autonomous/driverless cars that may change transportation as we know it. As we explore this subject, we learn that driverless cars—like many innovations, including those in finance—offer benefits as well as risks in the effort to protect humans from our bad behavior.

So Hot it Must Be a Quarter of 380 DegreesPosted Jun 24 2016 by  Andrew Burns  in Newsletter 


One of our passions at Hamilton Point is to lay bare insincere Wall Street habits—one of which is for firms to brag about how many assets they manage. One such trick is to express assets managed as a fraction of something much larger—like, “we manage half of a trillion dollars.” Our point goes beyond the unnecessary embellishment and includes our strong belief that many firms—when boasting about their size—are actually advertising their biggest weakness, which is that they are too big to serve clients effectively.

What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (3.64% upside)
