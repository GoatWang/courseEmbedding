Gamma for Public Sector




Shrinking budgets. Increased scrutiny. They’re shaking up Government and public sector IT spending. But making economies must never compromise public services.
So there’s a real need to work with suppliers who can innovate and help liberate the true value of existing IT and telecoms investments. Because doing more with less has never been as important.
That’s why public sector procurements are now all about achieving specific outcomes. Not the technologies, products and solutions used to achieve them. It’s an approach that favours alert and quick thinking vendors. Those not afraid to be disruptive. Those prepared to take a different path to the entrenched legacy suppliers.




“During clearing we were able to answer far more concurrent calls due to the extra SIP channels and had no issues whatsoever. The fact Gamma could provide SIP via JANET was a huge factor for us. As well as getting scalable capacity we’re saving money on telecoms too.”
Jon O’Grady,
Senior Technical Analyst,
De Montfort University

An introduction to Gamma in the Public Sector




 





Procurement Frameworks





























Our public sector team provides specialist sales, ongoing relationship management and delivery focus for central and local government, education, health and housing organisations throughout the UK. We deliver next generation communication services via our own award winning UK fibre network. We have built a strong reputation for listening to our customers, providing the solutions they need and, most importantly, delivering the services they require. All this means our core service teams are uniquely placed with the experience, control and ‘know how’ to meet the specific support and provisioning requirements your organisation needs.
As an approved provider on key network communications frameworks including Crown Commercial Services (Network Services – RM1045), we seek to engage with your long term ICT strategy and provide a transparent route to procurement, delivery and ongoing management. We understand the budget pressures that you are facing and will work with you to increase the impact of every pound you spend, making your budget go further.
We are underpinned by an ethos of quality and singular systems across our network, operations and billing teams. This philosophy meets a range of recognised ISO standards to deliver you the highest quality of service.
We are proud to offer our services to the public sector though a number of procurement frameworks: Crown Commercial Service Network Services – RM1045, G-Cloud, Scottish Procurement, JANET purchasing service and Procurement for Housing. It means there is a framework you can use to make buying from us that much easier and provides peace of mind that you are dealing with a supplier that will provide the right communications solutions for your organisation at the best possible price.





Crown Commercial Services Network Services RM1045 is the cornerstone of public sector frameworks. We are now appointed under the following ‘lots’ providing comprehensive access to tenders for voice, data, mobile and IP communications:
Lot 1: Data access services
Lot 3: Traditional telephony services
Lot 4: Inbound telephony services
Lot 5: IP telephony services
Lot 6: Mobile voice and data services
Lot 8: Videoconferencing services
Lot 9: Audioconferencing services
Lot 10: Integrated Communications
*The RM1045 framework replaces three existing agreements: RM860 PSN Connectivity, RM1498 PSN Services and RM1035 Telephony Services.  It is also recognised under its pre-launch project headings Public Services Network 2 (PSN2) and Public Sector Telecommunication Services (PSTS).

Controlling Costs




We can rationalise existing disparate network and telecoms estates, helping you make the most of existing budgets and investments while reducing your unpredictable, variable costs. We can go even further, moving you from a capital to an operational expenditure model by migrating away from expensive and inflexible technology such as ISDN and moving to our next generation SIP services or our hosted Horizon telephony platform.










Return On Investment




Cost of ownership can be a hard sell to management. With our solutions you’ll always get complete, accurate billing and management information in real time. To guide on-the-spot decision making while providing positive proof points for the board. We provide tools like Inbound that can ensure business continuity, and provide irrefutable evidence of tangible business improvement.










Flexibility




Gamma’s solutions are natural enablers for mobility and flexibility in business. Hot-desking, home working and mobile working are just the start.










Productivity




Flexible working is one factor in driving staff productivity. Gamma’s solutions go one step further with intelligent call routing, fixed/mobile integration and unified communications compliance tested and able to integrate with Microsoft Skype for Business and leading CRM tools such as Salesforce, to help your staff work and collaborate smarter and more effectively.










How does Gamma ensure quality?




More than 98% of our customers have remained with us after the first year of service. This retention rate is one of the highest in the marketplace, thanks to our excellent customer service.
Satisfaction is our priority.
To maintain and enhance our standards, we have an ongoing programme to measure satisfaction:

We interview a randomly-selected sub-set of around 100 customers every quarter. We ask them how we are solving their telecoms and data solutions challenges. This provides us with our NPS (Net Promoter Score) which is an independent survey based on how likely you would be to recommend us to other businesses.
We use visual management tools to provide real-time account status for all our staff to make sure that we’re always on track with your account.
We carry out our own quality-of-service audits, checking key performance indicators (KPIs) for ordering, speed of service restoration/fault repair and billing accuracy.

About you





You’re a successful, specialist organisation – expert in your particular field. You have loyal customers, service users, partners and stakeholders who all respect what you do for them, because you’re not afraid go the extra mile. Take that little bit more trouble.  Just to be sure the people you deal with are 100% happy, 100% satisfied with your service delivery.
Naturally you want to deal with suppliers who think and work the same way you do. Who respect the same values and standards and whose hard-won reputation comes from a dogged determination to do a good job and offer the best possible best value for its customers too.





Now here’s where we’d normally start singing our own praises. But we’d prefer not to do that. We’d much rather you did.
We think it’s more important that we’re judged on our own merits, by our own customers and partners. Not by a few words on our website that tell you how great we ourselves think we are.
Read our case studies. Talk to our existing users. Then talk to us. Put us to the test. See if we measure up.
Because this is about you. Not us.

Sector’s global healthcare team comprises six investment professionals, who together have more than 50 years’ experience of
                                 investing in the global healthcare sector. The two portfolio managers, Trond Horneland and Trond Tviberg, have worked together
                                 for over 10 years, managing top-quartile long-only healthcare funds and an award-winning hedge fund.
                              
The team is organised as a separate investment company, Sector Gamma AS, which is owned by the investment professionals and the Group’s holding company (Sector Asset Management AS). Sector Gamma
                                 AS is a regulated investment firm, authorised by the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to provide active management
                                 services and investment advice.
                              
The team currently manages two products. A market-neutral equity hedge fund, Sector Healthcare, was launched in September 2005. This was followed by a long-only UCITS fund, Sector Healthcare Value Fund, which was launched in November 2010.
                              
The healthcare sector is dominated by company-specific factors such as new product launches, as well as the inherent cyclicality
                                 caused by individual patent expirations. Given the dynamic nature of the industry, it has historically been an attractive
                                 universe for active stock selection strategies.
                              
The team seeks to add value through fundamental research, a rigorous investment process and an adaptive portfolio construction
                                 process.  As a bottom-up value-based investor our portfolios often have a contrarian tilt and early-stage biotech investments
                                 are largely avoided due to risk considerations.
                              
The team comprises the following professionals:
Trond Horneland, born 1972, is an investment manager at Sector. Before joining Sector in 2005, he was Head of Global Healthcare at DnB NOR
                                 Asset Management in Norway, where he was responsible for managing all DnB NOR global healthcare investments. He joined DnB
                                 NOR in 1998 as an analyst/portfolio manager covering the healthcare sector. Mr Horneland holds a Master’s degree from the
                                 Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration.
                              
Trond Tviberg, born 1968, is an investment manager at Sector. Before joining Sector in 2005, he was Portfolio Manager in the Global Healthcare
                                 team at DnB NOR Asset Management in Norway. Mr Tviberg joined DnB NOR in 1999 after five years in US Equity Sales at S.G.

Thomas McKeon, born 1968, joined Sector in 2009. Before joining Sector he was Head of Global Healthcare at DnB NOR Asset Management in
                                 New York, where he had been responsible for managing DnB NOR global healthcare investments since 2005. Mr McKeon joined DnB
                                 NOR in 2003 as a portfolio manager in the Global Healthcare team at DnB NOR Asset Management after working for four years

                                 6 years handled currency trading, profit/loss reporting, risk monitoring and various projects across Sector’s funds. Mr. Søberg
