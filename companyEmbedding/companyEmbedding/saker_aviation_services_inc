NEW YORK, Oct. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Saker Aviation Services, Inc. (SKAS), an aviation services company specializing in ground-based services to the general aviation marketplace, today announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, FBO Air Garden City, Inc. d/b/a Saker Aviation Services, has acquired 100% of the stock of Aircraft Services, Inc., ("Aircraft Services") an aircraft maintenance services firm located in Garden City, Kansas.








"We are excited to welcome Aircraft Services, its owners, Gary and Kim Keller, and their skilled staff into the Saker Aviation family," stated Ron Ricciardi, Saker's President.  "Aircraft Services has provided outstanding aircraft maintenance services to its customers at and around the Garden City Regional Airport ("GCK") for the over 20 years.  We are also very happy that Gary has agreed to continue in his role, which will ensure a seamless transition.  The acquisition also provides a perfect complement to our FBO operations at GCK and enables us to more fully service both based and transient aircraft."
Under the terms of the transaction, Saker made a $150,000 cash payment at closing and will make installment payments totaling an additional $150,000 over the next two years.  The closing cash payment for the transaction was funded with internal resources.
About Saker Aviation Services, Inc. Saker Aviation Services (www.SakerAviation.com), through our subsidiaries, operates in the aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation ("FBO"), as a provider of aircraft maintenance services, and as a consultant for a seaplane base that we do not own.  FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft, and other miscellaneous services.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementThis press release may contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "estimates," "expects" and similar references to future periods.   These statements may include projections of revenue, provisions for doubtful accounts, income or loss, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, other financial items, statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, statements of future economic performance, statements of the assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing statements and statements other than statements of historical fact.  
Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. The Company therefore cautions readers of this press release against relying on any of these forward-looking statements because they are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the Company's services and pricing, general economic conditions, its ability to raise additional capital, its ability to obtain the various approvals and permits for the acquisition and operation of FBOs and the other risk factors contained under Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.
Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause the Company's actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

NEW YORK, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Saker Aviation Services, Inc. (SKAS), an aviation services company specializing in ground-based services to the general aviation marketplace, today announced its financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Revenue and net loss in the three months ended March 31, 2017 of $2,041,261 and $152,119, respectively, were down 31.2 percent and $338,485, respectively, as compared to revenue of $2,967,080 and net income of $186,366 in the three months ended March 31, 2016.  








"The first quarter of 2017 was challenging, as anticipated." stated Ron Ricciardi, the Company's President.  "The final phase of air tour reductions, which occurred on January 1st and is now at the full 50 percent, was the primary driver of our results.  The reductions are targeted against 2015 activity while Q1 2016 enjoyed full and unfettered activity, which negatively impacted the year-over-year comparisons.  In fact Q1 2016 tour activity exceeded 2015 by over 36 percent.  Further burdening results was the Easter holiday, which occurred in Q1 in 2016 but in Q2 in 2017.  Given that these are extraordinary factors, we anticipate that future quarters will not be influenced to the same extent as Q1, though the reductions will continue to challenge year-over-year comparisons."  
The Company also reported Adjusted EBITDA1 of $87,180 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $383,069 or 81.7 percent as compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $475,249 in the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Please see footnote 1 below for the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA, a description of why the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and important disclaimers regarding Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the appropriate GAAP measure is also included in footnote 1.
About Saker Aviation Services, Inc.Saker Aviation Services (www.SakerAviation.com), through our subsidiaries, operates in the aviation services segment of the general aviation industry, in which we serve as the operator of a heliport, a fixed base operation ("FBO"), and as a consultant for a seaplane base that we do not own.  FBOs provide ground-based services, such as fueling and aircraft storage for general aviation, commercial and military aircraft, and other miscellaneous services.
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statement
This press release contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as "anticipates," "intends," "plans," "seeks," "believes," "estimates," "expects" and similar references to future periods.   These statements may include projections of revenue, provisions for doubtful accounts, income or loss, capital expenditures, repayment of debt, other financial items, statements regarding our plans and objectives for future operations, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions, statements of future economic performance, statements of the assumptions underlying or relating to any of the foregoing statements and statements other than statements of historical fact.  
Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and assumptions regarding its business, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. The Company's actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. The Company therefore cautions readers of this press release against relying on any of these forward-looking statements because they are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include the Company's services and pricing, general economic conditions, its ability to raise additional capital, its ability to obtain the various approvals and permits for the acquisition and operation of FBOs and the other risk factors contained under Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Any forward-looking statement made in this press release speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Factors or events that could cause the Company's actual results to differ may emerge from time to time and it is not possible to predict all of them. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.
-FINANCIAL TABLES TO FOLLOW -
1 Explanation of Adjusted EBITDA, a Non-GAAP Financial Measure
The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted for stock based compensation expense and other income and expense items.  The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA, which is a financial measure that is not defined by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP"), is a useful performance metric because it eliminates non-cash and/or non-recurring charges to earnings.  It is important to note that non-GAAP measures such as Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net income, cash flows, or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.  A reconciliation of net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.
