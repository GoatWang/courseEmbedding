1 review for Sweet and Sour Asian Rice






5 out of 5


rachael.d.compton – July 7, 2017

Of the packs we ordered, this is by far our favorite! It’s got a great sweet and sour flavor, even with pieces of pineapple that you find in your bites! Ugh, so ridiculously good. If you love putting sweet and sour sauce on your fried rice when you get cheap Chinese take out, this will scratch that itch so hard for you.

Mountain House Pouches
All Mountain House entrees are fully cooked and then freeze dried to retain all important nutrients and flavor. Just add boiling water, and you will have a hot, tasty meal in less than 10 minutes (cold or room temperature water can be used, but it will increase the rehydration/reconstitution time to about 20 minutes). Click on the Additional Info tab for more product information.

Mountain House freeze dried foods are the top choice for backpacking, hiking, camping, and RV trips, and great for emergencies too!
We are a stocking distributor for the entire Mountain House brand product line. Our inventory is current and fresh stock. We receive regular shipments direct from the manufacturer, OFD Foods LLC (formerly Oregon Freeze Dry), located in Albany, Oregon (about 45 minutes north of our warehouse facility in Eugene).
Storage and Handling
DO NOT OPEN UNTIL READY TO USE. Store your food in dry, sanitary conditions, avoiding any environment that could cause damage to the packaging. Pouches should be stored unopened. Avoid prolonged exposure to temperatures above 75°F to maximize shelf life.

                        Mountain House Sweet & Sour Pork with Rice                    


                                TheEpicenter-Staff-Review posted on 27 Jul, 2017                            






            High Rating. Some of us here at TheEpicenter gave this 5 stars! This dish is a very nice blend of diced pork, rice, red pepper, and onions with a hint of soy flavor surrounded in a perfectly sweet pineapple sauce. This is very good. Not too sweet, not too salty, just right.

Mountain House Pouches



Best Tasting, Top Rated Freeze Dried Food for Camping, Hiking, Backpacking, and Emergency & Disaster Preparedness
Mountain House® freeze dried food packaged in compact, lightweight, and convenient pouches with a 30+ year shelf life* when stored as recommended (except for the novelty Ice Cream and Cheesecake products, which have a 2-year shelf life, and the SPECIAL SILVER MYLAR POUCHES have a stated 1-year shelf life).
The Pro-Pak pouches are vacuum sealed for compactness and will not expand at high altitude, and contain fewer servings than the standard size pouches. Mountain House pouches are the top choice for outdoor enthusiasts and the perfect food for your outdoor activities such as camping, backpacking, hiking, hunting, fishing. We highly recommend Mountain House freeze dried food for grab and go bags because they are so convenient for emergency survival supply kits. 
* Shelf Life: Mountain House food will taste virtually undistinguishable from new for the stated shelf life, and perhaps even longer when stored as recommended. Store your freeze dried food in dry, sanitary conditions without prolonged exposure to temperatures above 75°F, and avoid any environment that could cause damage to the packaging. See the Mountain House Shelf Life and Taste Guarantee for additional information.

 Quaker Popped - Sour Cream and Onion is rated    4.6 out of    5 by    1027.               Rated 5 out of            5  by        dani4813 from        My favorite!! We received our Quaker Popped bags yesterday as our first BzzAgent campaign. We opened and taste tested each bag as a family. My daughters preferred the caramel flavor the best while my husband preferred the cheddar and my favorite was the sour cream and onion - we are very different when it comes to tastes!! We all agreed that they were great snacks and I even had to take the bag away from my daughter so she would eat her dinner! My only complaint is that we only received one bag of caramel! I can see us taking these on road trips or packing in lunches for school. We obviously were pleased with the product.

I received 5 bags of Quaker Popped Rice Crisps to try and share as part of a Bzz Campaign. I've tried rice cakes before and, while they were okay, they were never a family favorite. Rice cakes may not be a favorite, but rice crisps sure are! All three flavors were a hit in our house, the caramel corn being the favorite. The sour cream and onion and the cheddar are also very good. The fact that they are gluten free and are are chocked full of whole grains in each serving make them our go to healthy snack. This light, crispy treat is sure to win your family over too. The only drawback is they are so good, it's hard to stop with just one serving. Date published: 2015-02-07                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        MommaWeigle from        My kids went crazy over these! I have very picky eaters.....my kids range in age from 19 months to 6 1/2 years old. Getting them to eat a healthy snack isn't the hard part, it's getting them to finish the snack. We received these Quaker popped from being a #BzzAgent, which allowed for us to try them for free. We had the sour cream and onion, cheddar cheese, and caramel. My son ate an entire bag by himself!! He absolutely loves them. My daughters love them too but missed out on eating too many because my son loved them so much ha ha. I highly recommend these for parents with younger children who are looking for a healthy snack!! Kudos to you Quaker!! #BzzAgent #Gotitfree Date published: 2015-02-21                 Rated 4 out of            5  by        mikescatherine from        No guilt snacking :) I received a sample of the quaker popped sour cream and onion rice snacks to try out and provide my honest review.First off, i liked the texture of the quaker popped sour crean and onion rice snacks, they are crunchy without being too hard, the flavour is good as well. They aren't too salty either, i think there make a great replacement for chips any day. My kids even liked them, which is hard to find a gluten-free snack that they enjoy. Overall i give them 4 out of 5 stars, great texture, flavors, availability is good too. Just don't forget to use a bag clip as they get stale quickly.Bzzagent and quaker provided me with free samples of this product to review. Date published: 2015-02-18                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        ajerickson from        Sour Cream and Chive please I tried Quaker Popped rice krisps for free from Quaker and I was surprised! I thought for sure this gluten free rice snack would be grainy and hard like all the other rice snacks on the market out there. But I was wrong! The sour cream and chive was a delicious treat...didn't make me feel like I was eating anything gluten free! The krisps were a good texture and the flavor was yummy! I could of ate the entire bag...but I refrained myself so my kids could share in the yumminess. My nephew has Celiac so I try to keep a gluten free snack in the house when he visits....looks like I 'll have to pick up more since they are all gone now:) Thanks Quaker! Date published: 2015-02-16                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        missrugby from        Addicted to Popped I was a little skeptical that Popped would be a tasteful snack, and I was pleasantly surprised. As a bzzagent I received five bags in the mail to try. These are my new favorite snack. I have made a vow that I would live a healthier lifestyle, and Quaker Popped are a huge help. I love to snack on things, but there aren't many healthy alternatives. My six year old son even loves them. The Sour Cream are our favorite, but they are all wonderful! I have told everyone about these little gems. I do wish the Sour Cream flavor were easily found in stores like the other flavors, but apparently they are everyone else's favorite as well. Date published: 2015-02-02                 Rated 4 out of            5  by        Haustin from        A hit with family! I was excited to try this product when I got it free from BzzAgent. My family really likes Quaker Popped Rice Crisps. We like them for snacking since they are the perfect size and I feel good about offering them as a healthier alternative to chips or crackers. We love the flavors and the crunch. The sour cream and onion is my 8-year old son's favorite and he has turned down chips to eat these.The taste is light and feels like a modern take on the rice cake. I remember rice cakes as tasting like cardboard, but Popped Rice Crisps do not taste like cardboard. Popped rice crisps have good flavor and contain whole grains. We'll be eating these again. Date published: 2015-02-08                 Rated 5 out of            5  by        SandraTWP from        A BIG hit at our house I received these Sour Cream & Onion Popped Rice Crisps free, as a BzzAgent, in order to promote the brand. I'm going to be honest. This was NOT my favorite flavor. I didn't hate it, I think I was just really looking forward to a sour cream and onion snack, and found this one to be a bit mild, without enough "tang" for what I was hoping for.That said, my husband DEVOURED the entire bag. He generally eats sour cream & onion snacks more often than I, and I have to say, I think that maybe my palate is just off the mark. He thoroughly enjoyed these Popped Rice Crisps, and I have no doubt would be VERY happy to see them in the cabinet again!
