Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 1.25%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

About Risk: 
Investment in mutual funds involves risk, including possible loss of principal invested. You could lose money on your investment in the Fund or the Fund could underperform because of the following risks: the market prices of bonds held by the Fund may fa ll; individual investments of the Fund may not perform as expected; and/or the Fund's portfolio management practices may not achieve the desired result. Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. When interest rates rise, the value of  fixed-income securities will generally fall. In addition, the credit quality of the securities may deteriorate, which could lead to default or bankruptcy of the issuer where the issuer becomes unable to pay its obligations when due. Because a significant  portion of securities held by the Fund may have variable or floating interest rates, the amount of the Fund's monthly distributions to shareholders are expected to vary. Generally when market interest rates fall, the amount of the distributions will dec rease. Investments in high-yield, high risk bonds can involve a substantial risk of loss. An active trading style can result in higher turnover (exceeding 100%), may translate to higher transaction costs, may increase your tax liability, and may affect F und performance. Investing primarily in responsible investments carries the risk that, under certain market conditions, the Fund may underperform funds that do not utilize a responsible investment strategy. In evaluating a company, the Advisor is depende nt upon information and data that may be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable, which could cause the Advisor to incorrectly assess a company’s ESG performance.



1. Bloomberg Barclays 9-12 Months Short Treasury Index measures the performance of U.S Treasury bills, notes, and bonds with a maturity between nine and twelve months. Unless otherwise stated, index returns do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales  charges, commissions, expenses, taxes or leverage, as applicable. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Historical performance of the index illustrates market trends and does not represent the past or future performance of the fund.
2. Source: Fund prospectus.
3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
4. Top 10 Holdings excludes cash and equivalents.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. Max Sales Charge: 1.25%.

3. Net expense ratio reflects a contractual expense reimbursement that continues through 1/31/18. Without the reimbursement, if applicable, performance would have been lower.
6. The Morningstar Ultrashort Bond Category includes funds that invest primarily in investment-grade U.S. fixed income and have durations typically less than one year.
7. SEC 30-day yield is a standardized measure based on the estimated yield to maturity of a fund's investments over a 30-day period and is based on the maximum offer price at the date specified. The SEC 30-day yield is not based on the distributions made by  the fund, which may differ. Subsidized yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Distribution Rate at NAV is calculated by dividing the last distribution paid per share (annualized) by NAV. The Fund's monthly distribution may  be comprised of ordinary income, net realized capital gains and returns of capital.
8. A portion of the Fund's returns may be comprised of return of capital or short term capital gains. The Fund will determine the tax characteristics of all Fund distributions after the end of the calendar year and will provide shareholders such information  at that time. Please consult your tax advisor for further information.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

			Objective & Strategy
		

			
				The fund seeks total return, comprised of current income and capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets, plus the amount of any borrowings for investment purposes, in senior secured floating rate loans made by banks and other financial institutions and in senior secured floating rate debt instruments.

			
			
				
			
		



Helping enhance income
Today's fixed income investors are facing new and unique challenges as traditional fixed income investments are providing historically low income and are increasingly vulnerable to the threat of rising interest rates. The characteristics of the Invesco Floating Rate Fund, such as attractive current income and  short duration, provide the potential to defend against rising rates and inflation and overall fixed income diversification within a portfolio. 

Overview
Inflation/Rising rateshedge
Fixed income diversification
Current income




Explore High-Conviction Investing with Invesco











Potentially higher yields in a rising rate environment
The floating rates and diversification potential of senior secured loans may help you enhance income during times when traditional bonds may come under pressure. The floating rate coupons may provide a potential hedge against inflation and rising interest rates.
Since inception, Floating Rate Fund has historically provided positive returns during the majority of rising rate periods



Performance quoted is past performance and cannot guarantee comparable future results; current performance may be lower or higher. Click the performance tab for the most recent month end performance. Performance figures reflect reinvested distributions and changes in net asset value (NAV). Performance shown at NAV does not include maximum applicable front-end sales charge (2.50%). If sales charges had been reflected, performance would be lower. Investment return and principal value will vary so that you may have a gain or a loss when you sell shares. Fund performance reflects any applicable fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements. Had the adviser not waived fees and/or reimbursed expenses in the past, returns would have been lower.

Bonds represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index; US Government Credit represented by the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index. Fund performance shown is Class A shares at NAV. If sales charge had been included, performance would be lower. The fund may have experienced periods of underperformance during periods of declining rates. Performance during all periods is cumulative. Past performance cannot guarantee future results. An investment cannot be made directly in an index. Rising rates are defined as any period where interest rates, as represented by the 10-year Treasury rate, increased at least 1%, or 100 basis points. A basis point (bps) is the smallest measure used for quoting yields on bonds and notes. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point, or 0.01%. 
Index Definitions: Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index represents securities that are SEC-registered, taxable, and dollar denominated. The index covers the US investment grade fixed rate bond market, with index components for government and corporate securities, mortgage pass-through securities, and asset-backed securities. Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Government Credit Index is a component of the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and includes treasuries, agencies, publicly issued US corporate and foreign debentures and secured notes. 
Duration is the measure of a debt security's price sensitivity to interest rate changes, expressed in terms of years. Securities with longer durations usually are more sensitive to interest rate movements than those with shorter durations. Should interest rates change, the value of a fund that invests in securities with longer durations will fluctuate more than the value of a fund that invests in securities with shorter durations. 





Potentially low correlation
Incorporating senior loan funds in a portfolio may complement other traditional fixed income holdings and serve as a portfolio diversifier, which may help mitigate overall volatility.

Senior and secured, helping mitigate principal erosion
Senior secured loans are at the top of the capital structure, enabling its issuers to get paid first in the event of default or bankruptcy. Additionally, senior secured loans generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on at least a quarterly basis. 
Senior secured loans are a priority of repayment in the event of default
      Senior secured loans rank highest in the capital structure.

Low priority

Senior secured loans are secured by companies' collateral such as:

There is a risk that the value of the collateral required on investments in senior secured floating rate loans and debt securities may not be sufficient to cover the amount owed, may be found invalid, may be used to pay other outstanding obligations of the borrower or may be difficult to liquidate. 
Current income
Senior secured loans, like traditional bonds, generate current income as companies pay their contractual interest on — at least — a quarterly basis. Senior secured loans potentially  have  the added diversification  benefits of high  income  with short  duration.
Loans continued to offer investors a high level of current income with short duration

 About risk
			 


Bank Loan Risk. There are a number of risks associated with an investment in bank loans including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and prepayment risk. Lack of an active trading market, restrictions on resale, irregular trading activity, wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods may impair the Fund's ability to sell bank loans within its desired time frame or at an acceptable price and its ability to accurately value existing and prospective investments. Extended trade settlement periods may result in cash not being immediately available to the Fund. As a result, the Fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions to raise cash to meet its obligations. The risk of holding bank loans is also directly tied to the risk of insolvency or bankruptcy of the issuing banks. These risks could cause the Fund to lose income or principal on a particular investment, which in turn could affect the Fund's returns. The value of bank loans can be affected by and sensitive to changes in government regulation and to economic downturns in the United States and abroad. Bank loans generally are floating rate loans, which are subject to interest rate risk as the interest paid on the floating rate loans adjusts periodically based on changes in widely accepted reference rates.
Borrowing Risk. Borrowing money to buy securities exposes the Fund to leverage and will cause the Fund's share price to be more volatile because leverage will exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund's portfolio securities. Borrowing money may also require the Fund to liquidate positions when it may not be advantageous to do so. In addition, the Fund will incur interest expenses and other fees on borrowed money. There can be no assurance that the Fund's borrowing strategy will enhance and not reduce the Fund's returns.
Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current historically low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the completion of the FRB's quantitative easing program and the "tapering" of other similar foreign central bank actions. This eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. CLOs are subject to the risks of substantial losses due to actual defaults by underlying borrowers, which will be greater during periods of economic or financial stress. CLOs may also lose value due to collateral defaults and disappearance of subordinate tranches, market anticipation of defaults, and investor aversion to CLO securities as a class. The risks of CLOs will be greater if the Fund invests in CLOs that hold loans of uncreditworthy borrowers or if the Fund holds subordinate tranches of the CLO that absorbs losses from the defaults before senior tranches. In addition, CLOs are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.
Credit Linked Notes Risk. Risks of credit linked notes include those risks associated with the underlying reference obligation including but not limited to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, default risk and, in some cases, foreign currency risk. An investor in a credit linked note bears counterparty risk or the risk that the issuer of the credit linked note will default or become bankrupt and not make timely payment of principal and interest of the structured security. Credit linked notes may be less liquid than other investments and therefore harder to dispose of at the desired time and price. In addition, credit linked notes may be leveraged and, as a result, small changes in the value of the underlying reference obligation may produce disproportionate losses to the Fund.
Debt Securities Risk. The prices of debt securities held by the Fund will be affected by changes in interest rates, the creditworthiness of the issuer and other factors. An increase in prevailing interest rates typically causes the value of existing debt securities to fall and often has a greater impact on longer-duration debt securities and higher quality debt securities. Falling interest rates will cause the Fund to reinvest the proceeds of debt securities that have been repaid by the issuer at lower interest rates. Falling interest rates may also reduce the Fund's distributable income because interest payments on floating rate debt instruments held by the Fund will decline. The Fund could lose money on investments in debt securities if the issuer or borrower fails to meet its obligations to make interest payments and/or to repay principal in a timely manner. Changes in an issuer's financial strength, the market's perception of such strength or in the credit rating of the issuer or the security may affect the value of debt securities. The Adviser's credit analysis may fail to anticipate such changes, which could result in buying a debt security at an inopportune time or failing to sell a debt security in advance of a price decline or other credit event.
Defaulted Securities Risk. Defaulted securities pose a greater risk that principal will not be repaid than non-defaulted securities. Defaulted securities and any securities received in an exchange for such securities may be subject to restrictions on resale.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Financial Services Sector Risk. The Fund may be susceptible to adverse economic or regulatory occurrences affecting the financial services sector. Financial services companies are subject to extensive government regulation and are disproportionately affected by unstable interest rates, each of which could adversely affect the profitability of such companies. Financial services companies may also have concentrated portfolios, which makes them especially vulnerable to unstable economic conditions.
Foreign Securities Risk. The Fund's foreign investments may be adversely affected by political and social instability, changes in economic or taxation policies, difficulty in enforcing obligations, decreased liquidity or increased volatility. Foreign investments also involve the risk of the possible seizure, nationalization or expropriation of the issuer or foreign deposits (in which the Fund could lose its entire investments in a certain market) and the possible adoption of foreign governmental restrictions such as exchange controls. Unless the Fund has hedged its foreign securities risk, foreign securities risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency rate fluctuations, which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency (or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies) to decline in value. Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. Currency hedging strategies, if used, are not always successful.
High Yield Debt Securities (Junk Bond) Risk. Investments in high yield debt securities ("junk bonds") and other lower-rated securities will subject the Fund to substantial risk of loss. These securities are considered to be speculative with respect to the issuer's ability to pay interest and principal when due, are more susceptible to default or decline in market value and are less liquid than investment grade debt securities. Prices of high yield debt securities tend to be very volatile.
Liquidity Risk. The Fund may be unable to sell illiquid investments at the time or price it desires and, as a result, could lose its entire investment in such investments. Liquid securities can become illiquid during periods of market stress. If a significant amount of the Fund's securities become illiquid, the Fund may not be able to timely pay redemption proceeds and may need to sell securities at significantly reduced prices.
Management Risk. The Fund is actively managed and depends heavily on the Adviser's judgment about markets, interest rates or the attractiveness, relative values, liquidity, or potential appreciation of particular investments made for the Fund's portfolio. The Fund could experience losses if these judgments prove to be incorrect. Additionally, legislative, regulatory, or tax developments may adversely affect management of the Fund and, therefore, the ability of the Fund to achieve its investment objective.
Market Risk. The market values of the Fund's investments, and therefore the value of the Fund's shares, will go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry or section of the economy, or it may affect the market as a whole. Individual stock prices tend to go up and down more dramatically than those of certain other types of investments, such as bonds. During a general downturn in the financial markets, multiple asset classes may decline in value. When markets perform well, there can be no assurance that specific investments held by the Fund will rise in value.
Risk of Subordinated Debt. Perpetual subordinated debt is a type of hybrid instrument that has no maturity date for the return of principal and does not need to be redeemed by the issuer. These investments typically have lower credit ratings and lower priority than other obligations of an issuer during bankruptcy, presenting a greater risk for nonpayment. This risk increases as the priority of the obligation becomes lower. Payments on these securities may be subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of subsidiaries and associated companies of an issuer. Additionally, some perpetual subordinated debt does not restrict the ability of an issuer’s subsidiaries to incur further unsecured indebtedness.

of a Letter of Credit, an amount, such as a required minimum or
multiple amount, is expressed in Dollars, but such Borrowing, Loan
or Letter of Credit is denominated in
 
38


an Alternative Currency, such amount shall be
the relevant Alternative Currency Equivalent of such Dollar amount
(rounded to the nearest unit of such Alternative Currency, with 0.5
of a unit being rounded upward), as determined by the
Administrative Agent or the applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, or at the election of the Administrative Agent, such other
amount as is customary for lending transactions in such Alternative
Currency, as reasonably determined by the Administrative
Agent.

(c) Where the permissibility of a
transaction (other than Credit Extensions and as permitted above)
depends upon compliance with, or is determined by reference to,
amounts stated in Dollars, any amount in respect of such
transaction stated in another currency shall be translated to
Dollars at the Spot Rate then in effect at the time such
transaction is entered into and the permissibility of actions taken
hereunder shall not be affected by subsequent fluctuations in
exchange rates.

1.09 Additional Alternative
Currencies

(a) The Company may from time to
time request that Loans be made and/or Letters of Credit be issued
in a currency other than Dollars and those specifically listed in
the definition of “Alternative Currency”;
provided that such requested currency is a lawful currency
(other than Dollars) that is readily available and freely
transferable and convertible into Dollars. Each such request shall
be subject to the approval of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders, in each case, in their sole discretion; and in the case of
any such request with respect to the issuance of Letters of Credit,
such request shall be subject to the approval of the Administrative
Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer, in each case, in their sole
discretion.

(b) Any such request shall be made
to the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m., twenty
(20) Business Days prior to the date of the desired Credit
Extension (or such other time or date as may be agreed by the
Administrative Agent and, in the case of any such request
pertaining to Letters of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer, in its
or their sole discretion). In the case of any such request
pertaining to Loans, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender thereof; and in the case of any such request pertaining
to Letters of Credit, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify the applicable L/C Issuer thereof. Each Lender (in the case
of any such request pertaining to Loans) or applicable L/C Issuer
(in the case of a request pertaining to Letters of Credit) shall
notify the Administrative Agent, not later than 11:00 a.m.,
ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such request whether
it consents, in its sole discretion, to the making of Loans or the
issuance of Letters of Credit, as the case may be, in such
requested currency.

(c) Any failure by a Lender or an
L/C Issuer, as the case may be, to respond to such request within
the time period specified in the preceding sentence shall be deemed
to be a refusal by such Lender or such L/C Issuer, as the case may
be, to permit Loans to be made or Letters of Credit to be issued in
such requested currency. If the Administrative Agent and all the
Lenders consent to making Loans in such requested currency, the
Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and such currency
shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative
Currency hereunder for purposes of any Borrowings of Loans (
provided that in granting such consent the Administrative
Agent or the Lenders may impose a limit on the Dollar Equivalent
amount of Loans permitted to be funded in such currency); and if
the Administrative Agent and the applicable L/C Issuer consent to
the issuance of Letters of Credit in such requested currency, the
Administrative Agent shall so notify the Company and such currency
shall thereupon be deemed for all purposes to be an Alternative
Currency hereunder for purposes of any Letter of Credit issuances (
provided that the Administrative Agent or the L/C Issuers
may impose a limit on the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of
Credit permitted to be issued in such currency). If the
Administrative Agent shall fail to obtain consent from any Lender
to any request for an additional currency under this
Section 1.09 the Administrative Agent shall promptly so
notify the Company.
 
39



1.10 Change of
Currency.

(a) Each obligation of any Borrower
to make a payment denominated in the national currency unit of any
member state of the European Union that adopts the Euro as its
lawful currency after the date hereof shall be redenominated into
Euro at the time of such adoption (in accordance with the EMU
Legislation). If, in relation to the currency of any such member
state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement
in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any
convention or practice in the London interbank market for the basis
of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis
shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from
the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful
currency; provided that if any Borrowing in the currency of
such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date,
such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Borrowing,
at the end of the then current Interest Period.

(b) Each provision of this Agreement
shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the
Administrative Agent may from time to time specify to be
appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state
of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or
practices relating to the Euro.

(c) Each provision of this Agreement
also shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction or
reasonable modifications as the Administrative Agent may from time
to time specify to be appropriate to reflect a change in currency
of any country and any relevant market conventions or practices
relating to the change in currency or to reflect adoption of
additional currencies as Alternative Currencies with respect to
Loans or the issuance of Letters of Credit in currencies which are
not Alternative Currencies as of the date hereof.

one or more Alternative Currencies from time to time on any
Business Day during the Availability Period in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed at any time outstanding the amount
of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment; provided ,
however , that after giving effect to any Borrowing of

not exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, (ii) the
aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of any Lender,
plus such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding

(iii) (x) the aggregate Outstanding Amount of Revolving
Loans and Letters of Credit denominated in Alternative Currencies
shall not exceed the Alternative Currency Sublimit, and (y) to
the extent the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders or L/C
Issuers, as applicable, have imposed a limit on the Dollar
Equivalent amount of Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may
be, with respect to any Alternative Currency, the Total Revolving
Outstandings denominated in such Alternative Currency shall not
exceed such limit, and (iv) the aggregate Total Revolving
Outstandings in respect of which Designated Borrowers are primarily
obligated shall not exceed the Designated Borrower Sublimit. Within
the limits of each Lender’s Revolving Commitment, and subject
to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Borrowers may borrow
under this Section 2.01 , prepay under
Section 2.05 , and reborrow under this
Section 2.01 . Revolving Loans may be Base Rate Loans
or Eurocurrency Rate Loans, as further provided herein;
provided , however , all Borrowings of Revolving
Loans made on the Closing Date shall be made as Base
Rate
 
40


Loans; provided , further , that
(A) all Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be made as
Canadian BA Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, and (B) all
Alternative Currency Loans denominated in a currency other than
Canadian Dollars shall be made as Eurocurrency Rate
Loans.

2.02 Borrowings, Conversions
and Continuations of Loans .

(a) Each Borrowing, each conversion
of Loans from one Type to the other, and each continuation of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans shall be made upon the Company’s
irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given
by telephone. Each such notice must be received by the
Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (i) three
(3) Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing
of, conversion to or continuation of, Eurocurrency Rate Loans
denominated in Dollars or of any conversion of Eurocurrency Rate
Loans denominated in Dollars to Base Rate Loans, (ii) four
(4) Business Days prior to the requested date of Borrowing or
continuation of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies (or
five (5) Business Days in the case of a Special Notice
Currency) and (iii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans. Each telephonic notice by the Company pursuant to
this Section 2.02(a) must be confirmed promptly by
delivery to the Administrative Agent of a written Loan Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans
other than Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$1,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or,
with respect to Alternative Currencies, unless the Administrative
Agent otherwise agrees in its sole discretion, the Dollar
Equivalent thereof). Except as provided in
Sections 2.03(c) and 2.04(c) , each Borrowing of
or conversion to Base Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of
$500,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Each
Loan Notice (whether telephonic or written) shall specify
(i) whether the Company is requesting a Borrowing, a
conversion of Loans from one Type to the other, or a continuation
of Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Canadian BA Rate Loans, (ii) the
requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the
case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the
principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued,
(iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or to which existing
Loans are to be converted, (v) if applicable, the duration of
the Interest Period with respect thereto, (vi) the currency of
the Loans to be borrowed (including whether such currency is an
Alternative Currency) and (vii) if the requested currency is
not Dollars, the Borrower. If the Company fails to specify a
currency in a Loan Notice, then the Loans so requested shall be
made in Dollars, and the Borrower shall be the Company. If the
Company fails to specify a Type of a Loan in a Loan Notice or if
the Company fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion
or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or
converted to, Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars;
provided , however , that in the case of a failure to
timely request a conversion or continuation of Loans denominated in
(x) Canadian Dollars, such Loans shall be continued as (or
converted into) Canadian Prime Rate Loans or (y) an
Alternative Currency (other than Canadian Dollars), such Loans
shall be continued as (or converted into) Eurocurrency Rate Loans
in such Alternative Currency with an Interest Period of one month.
Any such automatic conversion to Base Rate Loans (or, if
applicable, to Loans with an Interest Period of one month) shall be
effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect
with respect to the applicable Loans. If the Company requests a
Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Canadian BA Rate
Loans or Eurocurrency Rate Loans in any such Loan Notice, but fails
to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified
an Interest Period of one month. No Loan may be converted into or
continued as a Loan denominated in a different currency, but
instead must be prepaid in the existing currency of such Loan and
reborrowed in such other Alternative Currency. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, a Swing Line Loan may not be
converted to an a Canadian BA Rate Loan, a Canadian Prime Rate Loan
or a Eurocurrency Rate Loan.
 
41



(b) Following receipt of a Loan
Notice, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender
of the amount (and currency) of its Pro Rata Share of the
applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or
continuation is provided by the Company, the Administrative Agent
shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion
to Base Rate Loans or continuation of (or conversion into) Loans
with an Interest Period of one month denominated in a currency
other than Dollars, in each case as described in the preceding
subsection. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the
amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in Same
Day Funds at the Administrative Agent’s Office for the
applicable currency (x) not later than 1:00 p.m., in the case
of any Loan denominated in Dollars and (y) not later than the
Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case
of any Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, in each case on
the Business Day specified in the applicable Loan Notice. Upon
satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in
Section 5.02 (and, if such Borrowing is the initial
Credit Extension, Section 5.01 ), the Administrative
Agent shall make all funds so received available to the applicable
Borrower in like funds as received by the Administrative Agent
either by (i) crediting the account of the applicable Borrower
on the books of Bank of America with the amount of such funds or
(ii) wire transfer of such funds, in each case in accordance
with instructions provided to (and reasonably acceptable to) the
Administrative Agent by the Company or the applicable Borrower;
provided , however , that if, on the date of a
Borrowing of Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars, there are L/C
Borrowings outstanding, then the proceeds of such Borrowing,
first , shall be applied to the payment in full of any such
L/C Borrowings and second , shall be made available to the
applicable Borrower as provided above.

(c) Except as otherwise provided
herein, a Eurocurrency Rate Loan or Canadian BA Rate Loan may be
continued or converted only on the last day of the Interest Period
for such Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loans made in
Dollars may be requested as, converted into or continued as
Eurocurrency Rate Loans or Canadian BA Rate Loans without the
consent of the Required Lenders, and the Required Lenders may
demand that any or all of the then outstanding Eurocurrency Rate
Loans denominated in Dollars be converted immediately to Base Rate
Loans. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Required
Lenders may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid or redenominated
into Dollars as Base Rate Loans in the amount of the Dollar
Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the then current Interest
Period with respect thereto.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify the Company and the Lenders of the interest rate
applicable to any Interest Period for Eurocurrency Rate Loans,
Canadian BA Rate Loans or Canadian Prime Rate Loans, upon
determination of such interest rate. The determination of such rate
by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive in the absence of a
manifest error. At any time that Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime
Rate Loans are outstanding, the Administrative Agent shall notify
the Company and the Lenders of any change in Bank of
America’s prime rate or prime rate for Loans in Canadian
Dollars, as applicable used in determining the Base Rate or the
Canadian Prime Rate, as applicable, promptly following the public
announcement of such change.

(e) After giving effect to all
Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to the other,
and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be
more than eight Interest Periods, in the aggregate, in effect with
respect to Eurocurrency Rate Loans and Canadian BA Rate
Loans.

(C) the issuance of such Letter of
Credit would violate one or more policies of such L/C Issuer

arrangements, including the delivery of Cash Collateral,
satisfactory to such L/C Issuer (in its sole discretion) with the
Company or such Lender to eliminate such L/C Issuer’s actual
or potential Fronting Exposure (after giving effect to
Section 2.15(a)(iv) ) with respect to the Defaulting
Lender arising from either the Letter of Credit then proposed to be
issued or that Letter of Credit and all other L/C Obligations as to
which such L/C Issuer has actual or potential Fronting Exposure, as
it may elect in its sole discretion.

(iv) No L/C Issuer shall be under
any obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if (a) the L/C
Issuer thereof would have no obligation at such time to issue such
Letter of Credit in its amended form under the terms hereof or
(b) the beneficiary of such Letter of Credit does not accept
the proposed amendment to such Letter of Credit.

(v) No L/C Issuer shall be under any
obligation to issue or amend any Letter of Credit if the L/C Issuer
thereof has received written notice from any Lender, the
Administrative Agent or any Loan Party, on or prior to the Business
Day prior to the requested date of issuance or amendment of such
Letter of Credit, that one or more applicable conditions contained
in Article V shall not then be satisfied.

(b) Procedures for Issuance and
Amendment of Letters of Credit; Auto-Renewal Letters of Credit
.

(i) Each Letter of Credit shall be
issued or amended, as the case may be, upon the request of the
Company delivered to the applicable L/C Issuer (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) in the form of a Letter of Credit
Application, appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible
Officer of the Company. Such Letter of Credit Application must be
received by such L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent not later
than 11:00 a.m. at least two (2) Business Days (or such later
date and time as the Administrative Agent and such L/C Issuer may
agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the
proposed issuance date or date of amendment, as the case may be. In
the case of a request for an initial issuance of a Letter of
Credit, such Letter of Credit Application shall specify in form and
detail satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer: (a) the
proposed issuance date of the requested Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (b) the amount and currency thereof;
(c) the expiry date thereof; (d) the
 
44



name and address of the beneficiary
thereof; (e) the documents to be presented by such beneficiary
in case of any drawing thereunder; (f) the full text of any
certificate to be presented by such beneficiary in case of any
drawing thereunder; (g) the purpose and the nature of the
requested Letter of Credit and (h) such other matters as such
L/C Issuer may reasonably require. In the case of a request for an
amendment of any outstanding Letter of Credit, such Letter of
Credit Application shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to
the applicable L/C Issuer (a) the Letter of Credit to be
amended; (b) the proposed date of amendment thereof (which
shall be a Business Day); (c) the nature of the proposed
amendment; and (d) such other matters as such L/C Issuer may
reasonably require. Additionally, the Borrower shall furnish to the
L/C Issuer and the Administrative Agent such other documents
and information pertaining to such requested Letter of Credit
issuance or amendment, including any Issuer Documents, as the L/C
Issuer or the Administrative Agent may reasonably
require.

(ii) Promptly after receipt of any
Letter of Credit Application, the applicable L/C Issuer will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of
Credit Application from the Company and, if not, such L/C Issuer
will provide the Administrative Agent with a copy thereof. Upon
receipt by such L/C Issuer of confirmation from the Administrative
Agent that the requested issuance or amendment is permitted in
accordance with the terms hereof, then, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, the applicable L/C Issuer shall, on the
requested date, issue a Letter of Credit for the account of the
Company or enter into the applicable amendment, as the case may be,
in each case in accordance with such L/C Issuer’s usual and
customary business practices. Immediately upon the issuance of each
Letter of Credit, each Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such L/C
Issuer a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount
equal to the product of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
times the amount of such Letter of Credit.

(iii) If the Company so requests in
any applicable Letter of Credit Application, an L/C Issuer may, in
its sole and absolute discretion, agree to issue a Letter of Credit
that has automatic renewal provisions (each, an “
Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit ”); provided that
any such Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit must permit the applicable
L/C Issuer to prevent any such renewal at least once in each
twelve-month period (commencing with the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit) by giving prior notice to the beneficiary thereof
not later than a day (the “ Nonrenewal Notice Date
”) in each such twelve-month period to be agreed upon at the
time such Letter of Credit is issued. Unless otherwise directed by
the applicable L/C Issuer, the Company shall not be required to
make a specific request to such L/C Issuer for any such renewal.
Once an Auto-Renewal Letter of Credit has been issued, the Lenders
shall be deemed to have authorized (but may not require) the
applicable L/C Issuer to permit the renewal of such Letter of
Credit at any time to an expiry date not later than 180 days after
the Letter of Credit Expiration Date; provided ,
however , that such L/C Issuer shall not permit any such
renewal if (a) such L/C Issuer has determined that it would
not be permitted or would have no obligation at such time to issue
such Letter of Credit in its renewed form under the terms hereof
(by reason of the provisions of Section 2.03(a)(ii) or
otherwise), or (b) it has received notice (which may be by
telephone or in writing) on or before the day that is two
(2) Business Days before the Nonrenewal Notice Date from the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Company that one or more of
the applicable conditions specified in Section 5.02 is
not then satisfied.

(iv) Promptly after its delivery of
any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an
advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof,
the applicable L/C Issuer will also deliver to the Company and the
Administrative Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of
Credit or amendment.
 
45



(c) Drawings and Reimbursements;
Funding of Participations .

(i) Upon receipt from the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit of any notice of drawing under
such Letter of Credit, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the
Company and the Administrative Agent thereof. In the case of a
Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the
Company shall reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer in such
Alternative Currency, unless (A) such L/C Issuer (at its
option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require
reimbursement in Dollars or (B) in the absence of any such
requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Company shall have
notified such L/C Issuer promptly following receipt of the notice
of drawing that the Company will reimburse such L/C Issuer in
Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a
drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative
Currency, the applicable L/C Issuer shall notify the Company of the
Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following
the determination thereof. Not later than 11:00 a.m. on the date of
any payment by the applicable L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit
to be reimbursed in Dollars, or the Applicable Time on the date of
any payment by such L/C Issuer under a Letter of Credit to be
reimbursed in an Alternative Currency (each such date, an “
Honor Date ”), the Company shall reimburse the
applicable L/C Issuer through the Administrative Agent in an amount
equal to the amount of such drawing and in the applicable currency.
If the Company fails to so reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer by
such time, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of the Honor Date, the amount of the unreimbursed drawing
(expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent
thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an
Alternative Currency) (the “ Unreimbursed Amount
”), and the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share
thereof. In such event, the Company shall be deemed to have
requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans to be disbursed on the
Honor Date in an amount equal to the Unreimbursed Amount, without
regard to the minimum and multiples specified in
Section 2.02 for the principal amount of Base Rate
Loans, but subject to the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02 (other than the delivery of a Loan
Notice); provided that, after giving effect to such
Borrowing, the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments Any notice given by an L/C Issuer
or the Administrative Agent pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c)(i) may be given by telephone if
immediately confirmed in writing; provided , that the
lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the
conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

(ii) Each Lender (including the
Lender acting as L/C Issuer) shall upon any notice pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) make funds available (and the
Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this
purpose) to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable L/C Issuer, in Dollars, at the Administrative
Agent’s Office for Dollar-denominated payments in an amount
equal to its Pro Rata Share of the Unreimbursed Amount not later
than 1:00 p.m. on the Business Day specified in such notice by the
Administrative Agent, whereupon, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.03(c)(iii), each Lender that so makes funds
available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the
Company in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the
funds so received to the applicable L/C Issuer in
Dollars.

(iii) With respect to any
Unreimbursed Amount that is not fully refinanced by a Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans because the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02 cannot be satisfied or for any other
reason, the Company shall be deemed to have incurred from the
applicable L/C Issuer an L/C Borrowing in the amount of the
Unreimbursed Amount that is not so refinanced, which L/C Borrowing
shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and
shall bear interest at the Default Rate. In such event, each
Lender’s payment to the Administrative Agent for the account
of the applicable L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(ii) shall be deemed payment in respect
of its participation in such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an
L/C Advance from such Lender in satisfaction of its participation
obligation under this Section 2.03 .
 
46



(iv) Until each Lender funds its
Revolving Loan or L/C Advance pursuant to this
Section 2.03(c) to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer
for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in
respect of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such amount shall
be solely for the account of the applicable L/C Issuer.

(v) Each Lender’s obligation
to make Revolving Loans or L/C Advances to reimburse the applicable
L/C Issuer for amounts drawn under Letters of Credit, as
contemplated by this Section 2.03(c) , shall be
absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Lender may have
against the applicable L/C Issuer, the Company or any other Person
for any reason whatsoever; (b) the occurrence or continuance
of a Default, or (c) any other occurrence, event or condition,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided ,
however , that each Lender’s obligation to make
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.03(c) is
subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02
(other than delivery by the Company of a Loan Notice). No such
making of an L/C Advance shall relieve or otherwise impair the
obligation of the Company to reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer
for the amount of any payment made by the applicable L/C Issuer
under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided
herein.

(vi) If any Lender fails to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable L/C Issuer any amount required to be paid by such Lender
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 2.03(c) by the time specified in
Section 2.03(c)(ii) , the applicable L/C Issuer shall
be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting through the
Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon
for the period from the date such payment is required to the date
on which such payment is immediately available to the applicable
L/C Issuer at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight
Rate from time to time in effect plus any administrative,
processing or similar fees customarily charged by the applicable
L/C Issuer in connection with the foregoing. If such Lender pays
such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so
paid shall constitute such Lender’s Revolving Loan included
in the relevant Revolving Borrowing or L/C Advance in respect of
the relevant L/C Borrowing, as the case may be. A certificate of
the applicable L/C Issuer submitted to any Lender (through the
Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this
clause (vi) shall be conclusive absent manifest
error.

(d) Repayment of
Participations .

(i) At any time after an L/C Issuer
has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from
any Lender such Lender’s L/C Advance in respect of such
payment in accordance with Section 2.03(c) , if the
Administrative Agent receives for the account of the applicable L/C
Issuer any payment in respect of the related Unreimbursed Amount or
interest thereon (whether directly from the Company or otherwise,
including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the
Administrative Agent), the Administrative Agent will distribute to
such Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof (appropriately adjusted, in
the case of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during
which such Lender’s L/C Advance was outstanding) in the same
funds as those received by the Administrative Agent.

(ii) If any payment received by the
Administrative Agent for the account of an L/C Issuer pursuant to
Section 2.03(c)(i) is required to be returned under any
of the
 
47



circumstances described in
Section 11.06 (including pursuant to any settlement
entered into by the applicable L/C Issuer in its discretion), each
Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable L/C Issuer its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Lender, at
a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time
to time in effect. The obligations of the Lenders under this clause
shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the
termination of this Agreement.

(e) Obligations Absolute .
The obligation of the Company to reimburse the L/C Issuers for each
drawing under each Letter of Credit and to repay each L/C Borrowing
shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be paid
strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including the following:

(i) any lack of validity or
enforceability of such Letter of Credit, this Agreement, any other
Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument relating
thereto;

(ii) the existence of any claim,
counterclaim, set-off, defense or other right that the Company may
have at any time against any beneficiary or any transferee of such
Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or
any such transferee may be acting), any L/C Issuer or any other
Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or by such Letter of Credit or any agreement or
instrument relating thereto, or any unrelated
transaction;

(iii) any draft, demand, certificate
or other document presented under such Letter of Credit proving to
be forged, fraudulent, invalid or insufficient in any respect or
any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or
any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document
required in order to make a drawing under such Letter of
Credit;

(iv) waiver by the applicable L/C
Issuer of any requirement that exists for such L/C Issuer’s
protection and not the protection of the Company or any waiver by
such L/C Issuer which does not in fact prejudice the
Company;

(v) honor of a demand for payment
presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit requires
that demand be in the form of a draft;

(vi) any payment made by the
applicable L/C Issuer in respect of an otherwise complying item
presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or
the date by which documents must be received under such Letter of
Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC,
the ISP98 or the ICC, as applicable;

(vii) any payment by the applicable
L/C Issuer under such Letter of Credit against presentation of a
draft or certificate that does not strictly comply with the terms
of such Letter of Credit; or any payment made by the applicable L/C
Issuer under such Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the
benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative
of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter
of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding
under any Debtor Relief Law; or
 
48



(viii) any adverse change in the
relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant
Alternative Currency to the Company or any Subsidiary or in the
relevant currency markets generally; or

(ix) any other circumstance or
happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the
foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
Company.

The Company shall promptly examine a
copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is
delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance
with the Company’s instructions or other irregularity, the
Company will promptly notify the applicable L/C Issuer. The Company
shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against
the applicable L/C Issuer and its correspondents unless such notice
is given as aforesaid.

(f) Role of L/C Issuers .
Each Lender and the Company agree that, in paying any drawing under
a Letter of Credit, no L/C Issuer shall have any responsibility to
obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and
documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to
ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such
document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any
such document. None of any L/C Issuer, any Agent-Related Person or
any of the respective correspondents, participants or assignees of
any L/C Issuer shall be liable to any Lender for (i) any
action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or
with the approval of the Lenders or the Required Lenders, as
applicable; (ii) any action taken or omitted in the absence of
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct; or
(iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any document or instrument related to any Letter
of Credit or Letter of Credit Application. The Company hereby
assumes all risks of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or
transferee with respect to its use of any Letter of Credit;
provided , however , that this assumption is not
intended to, and shall not, preclude the Company’s pursuing
such rights and remedies as it may have against the beneficiary or
transferee at law or under any other agreement. None of any L/C
Issuer, any Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective
correspondents, participants or assignees of any L/C Issuer, shall
be liable or responsible for any of the matters described in
clauses (i) through (ix) of Section 2.03(e) ;
provided , however , that anything in such clauses to
the contrary notwithstanding, the Company may have a claim against
an L/C Issuer, and an L/C Issuer may be liable to the Company, to
the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to
consequential or exemplary, damages suffered by the Company which
the Company proves were caused by such L/C Issuer’s bad
faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence or such L/C
Issuer’s bad faith or willful or grossly negligent failure to
pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation to it by the
beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance
and not in limitation of the foregoing, each L/C Issuer may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without
responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice
or information to the contrary, and, absent bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct, no L/C Issuer shall be
responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any instrument
transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds
thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or
ineffective for any reason. The L/C Issuer may send a Letter of
Credit or conduct any communication to or from the beneficiary via
the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication
(“ SWIFT ”) message or overnight courier, or any
other commercially reasonable means of communicating with a
beneficiary.

(g) Applicability of ISP98 and
UCP . Unless otherwise expressly agreed by the applicable L/C
Issuer and the Company when a Letter of Credit is issued (including
any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit),
(i) the rules of the “ International Standby
Practices 1998 ” (or such later version thereof as may be
in effect at the time of issuance) published by the Institute of
International Banking Law & Practice (the “
ISP98 ”) shall apply to each standby Letter of Credit,
and
 
49


(ii) the rules of the Uniform Customs and
Practice for Documentary Credits, as most recently published by the
International Chamber of Commerce (the “ ICC ”)
at the time of issuance (including the ICC decision published by
the Commission on Banking Technique and Practice on April 6,
1998 regarding the European single currency (euro)) shall apply to
each commercial Letter of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the applicable L/C Issuer shall not be responsible to the Company
for, and such L/C Issuer’s rights and remedies against the
Company shall not be impaired by, any action or inaction of such
L/C Issuer required or expressly permitted under any law, order, or
practice that is applicable to any Letter of Credit or this
Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where
such L/C Issuer or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated
in the ISP98 or ICC, as applicable, or in the decisions, opinions,
practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking
Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade -
International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the
Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether
or not any L/C Issuer chooses such law or practice.

(h) Letter of Credit Fees .
The Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account
of each Lender in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, in Dollars,
(i) a fee for each commercial Letter of Credit equal to the
Applicable Rate times the Dollar Equivalent of the daily
maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
(whether or not such maximum amount is then in effect under such
Letter of Credit) and (ii) a fee for each standby Letter of
Credit equal to the Applicable Rate times the Dollar
Equivalent of the daily maximum amount available to be drawn under
such Letter of Credit (whether or not such maximum amount is then
in effect under such Letter of Credit) (each of clauses
(i) and (ii), a “ Letter of Credit Fee ”);
provided , however, any Letter of Credit Fees otherwise
payable for the account of a Defaulting Lender with respect to any
Letter of Credit as to which such Defaulting Lender has not
provided Cash Collateral satisfactory to the applicable L/C Issuer
pursuant to this Section 2.03 shall be payable, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, to the other Lenders in
accordance with the upward adjustments in their respective Pro Rata
Shares allocable to such Letter of Credit pursuant to
Section 2.15(a)(iv) , with the balance of such fee, if
any, payable to the applicable L/C Issuer for its own account. For
purposes of computing the daily amount available to be drawn under
any Letter of Credit, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be
determined in accordance with Section 1.08. Letter of Credit
Fees shall be (i) due and payable on the first Business Day
after the end of each March, June, September and December,
commencing with the first such date to occur after the issuance of
such Letter of Credit, on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date and
thereafter on demand and on the date of termination of the
Revolving Commitments and (ii) computed on a quarterly basis
in arrears. If there is any change in the Applicable Rate during
any quarter, the daily maximum amount of each Letter of Credit
shall be computed and multiplied by the Applicable Rate separately
for each period during such quarter that such Applicable Rate was
in effect.

(i) Fronting Fee and Documentary
and Processing Charges Payable to L/C Issuers . The Company
shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its own account in
Dollars a fronting fee with respect to each Letter of Credit issued
by such L/C Issuer equal to 0.125% per annum multiplied
by the Dollar Equivalent of the daily maximum amount available to
be drawn under such Letter of Credit. Such fronting fee shall be
computed on a quarterly basis in arrears and shall be due and
payable on the Business Day immediately following the last Business
Day of each March, June, September and December, commencing
with the first such date to occur after the issuance of such Letter
of Credit, and on the Letter of Credit Expiration Date. In
addition, the Company shall pay directly to each L/C Issuer for its
own account in Dollars the customary issuance, presentation,
amendment and other processing fees, and other standard costs and
charges, of such L/C Issuer relating to letters of credit as from
time to time in effect. Such customary fees and standard costs and
charges are due and payable on demand and are
nonrefundable.

(j) Conflict with Letter of
Credit Application . In the event of any conflict between the
terms hereof and the terms of any Letter of Credit Application, the
terms hereof shall control.
 
50



(k) Letters of Credit Issued for
Subsidiaries . Notwithstanding that a Letter of Credit issued
or outstanding hereunder is in support of any obligations of, or is
for the account of, a Subsidiary, the Company shall be obligated to
reimburse the applicable L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all
drawings under such Letter of Credit; provided that in the
case of a Letter of Credit issued for the account of a Designated
Borrower, such Designated Borrower shall be obligated to reimburse
the L/C Issuer hereunder for any and all drawings under such Letter
of Credit. The Company hereby acknowledges that the issuance of
Letters of Credit for the account of Subsidiaries inures to the
benefit of the Company, and that the Company’s business
derives substantial benefits from the businesses of such
Subsidiaries.

(l) Extensions . If the
Maturity Date in respect of any tranche of Commitments occurs prior
to the expiration of any Letter of Credit (such maturity date, the
“ Earlier Commitment Maturity Date ”), then
(i) on such Earlier Commitment Maturity Date, if one or more
other tranches of Commitments in respect of which the Maturity Date
shall not have occurred are then in effect, with the consent of
each L/C Issuer with respect to any outstanding Letter of Credit,
such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been
issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Lenders to
purchase participations therein and to make Revolving Loans and
payments in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
) under (and participated by Lenders pursuant to their respective
Pro Rata Shares with respect to) such later-maturing tranches of
Commitments up to an aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate
principal amount of the unutilized Commitments thereunder at such
time and (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to the
immediately preceding clause (i), the Company shall Cash
Collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with
Section 2.14 . Except to the extent of reallocations of
participations pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the occurrence of a Letter of Credit Expiration
Date with respect to a given tranche of Commitments shall have no
effect upon (and shall not diminish) the percentage participations
of the Lenders in any Letter of Credit issued before such Letter of
Credit Expiration Date.

2.04 Swing Line
Loans.

(a) The Swing Line . Subject
to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swing Line
Lender, in reliance upon the agreements of the other Lenders set
forth in this Section 2.04, may, in its sole discretion, make
loans (each such loan, a “ Swing Line Loan ”) to
the Company in Dollars from time to time on any Business Day during
the Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount not to
exceed at any time outstanding the amount of the Swing Line
Sublimit, notwithstanding the fact that such Swing Line Loans, when
aggregated with the Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of
Revolving Loans and L/C Obligations of the Swing Line Lender in its
capacity as a Lender of Revolving Loans, may exceed the amount of
such Lender’s Revolving Commitment; provided ,
however , that after giving effect to any Swing Line Loan,
(i) the Total Revolving Outstandings shall not exceed the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments, and (ii) except as set forth
above, the aggregate Outstanding Amount of the Revolving Loans of
any Lender, plus such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the
Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations, plus such
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of the Outstanding Amount of all
Swing Line Loans shall not exceed such Lender’s Revolving
Commitment, and provided , further , that the Company
shall not use the proceeds of any Swing Line Loan to refinance any
outstanding Swing Line Loan. Within the foregoing limits, and
subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the Company may
borrow under this Section 2.04 , prepay under
Section 2.05 , and reborrow under this
Section 2.04 . Each Swing Line Loan shall be a Base
Rate Loan. Immediately upon the making of a Swing Line Loan, each
Lender shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Swing Line Lender a
risk participation in such Swing Line Loan in an amount equal to
the product of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share times the amount
of such Swing Line Loan.
 
51



(b) Borrowing Procedures .
Each Swing Line Borrowing shall be made upon the Company’s
irrevocable notice to the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative
Agent, which may be given by telephone. Each such notice must be
received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent not
later than 1:00 p.m. on the requested borrowing date, and shall
specify (i) the amount to be borrowed, which shall be a
minimum principal amount of $100,000, or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof, and (ii) the requested borrowing
date, which shall be a Business Day. Each such telephonic notice
must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Swing Line Lender and
the Administrative Agent of a written Swing Line Loan Notice,
appropriately completed and signed by a Responsible Officer of the
Company. Promptly after receipt by the Swing Line Lender of any
telephonic Swing Line Loan Notice, the Swing Line Lender will
confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing)
that the Administrative Agent has also received such Swing Line
Loan Notice and, if not, the Swing Line Lender will notify the
Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) of the contents
thereof. Unless the Swing Line Lender has received notice (by
telephone or in writing) from the Administrative Agent (including
at the request of any Lender) prior to 2:00 p.m. on the date of the
proposed Swing Line Borrowing (a) directing the Swing Line
Lender not to make such Swing Line Loan as a result of the
limitations set forth in the first proviso to the first sentence of
Section 2.04(a) , or that one or more of the applicable
conditions specified in Article V is not then
satisfied, then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the
Swing Line Lender will, not later than 3:00 p.m. on the borrowing
date specified in such Swing Line Loan Notice, make the amount of
its Swing Line Loan available to the Company.

(c) Refinancing of Swing Line
Loans .

(i) The Swing Line Lender at any
time in its sole and absolute discretion may request, on behalf of
the Company (which hereby irrevocably requests and authorizes the
Swing Line Lender to so request on its behalf), that each Lender
make a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such Lender’s Pro
Rata Share of the amount of Swing Line Loans then outstanding. Such
request shall be made in writing (which written request shall be
deemed to be a Loan Notice for purposes hereof) and in accordance
with the requirements of Section 2.02 , without regard
to the minimum and multiples specified therein for the principal
amount of Base Rate Loans, but subject to the unutilized portion of
the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the conditions set forth in
Section 5.02 (other than delivery of a Loan Notice).
The Swing Line Lender shall furnish the Company with a copy of the
applicable Loan Notice promptly after delivering such notice to the
Administrative Agent. Each Lender shall make an amount equal to its
Pro Rata Share of the amount specified in such Loan Notice
available to the Administrative Agent in Same Day Funds (and the
Administrative Agent may apply Cash Collateral available with
respect to the applicable Swing Line Loan) for the account of the
Swing Line Lender at the Administrative Agent’s Office for
Dollar-denominated payments not later than 1:00 p.m. on the day
specified in such Loan Notice, whereupon, subject to
Section 2.04(c)(ii) , each Lender that so makes funds
available shall be deemed to have made a Base Rate Loan to the
Company in such amount. The Administrative Agent shall remit the
funds so received to the Swing Line Lender.

(ii) If for any reason any Swing
Line Loan cannot be refinanced by such a Borrowing of Revolving
Loans in accordance with Section 2.04(c)(i) , the
request for Base Rate Loans submitted by the Swing Line Lender as
set forth herein shall be deemed to be a request by the Swing Line
Lender that each of the Lenders fund its risk participation in the
relevant Swing Line Loan and each Lender’s payment to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing Line Lender
pursuant to Section 2.04(c)(i) shall be deemed payment
in respect of such participation.
 
52



(iii) If any Lender fails to make
available to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Swing
Line Lender any amount required to be paid by such Lender pursuant
to the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.04(c) by
the time specified in Section 2.04(c)(i) , the Swing
Line Lender shall be entitled to recover from such Lender (acting
through the Administrative Agent), on demand, such amount with
interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is
required to the date on which such payment is immediately available
to the Swing Line Lender at a rate per annum equal to the
applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any
administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by
the Swing Line Lender in connection with the foregoing. A
certificate of the Swing Line Lender submitted to any Lender
(through the Administrative Agent) with respect to any amounts
owing under this clause (iii) shall be conclusive absent
manifest error.

(iv) Each Lender’s obligation
to make Revolving Loans or to purchase and fund risk participations
in Swing Line Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c)
shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by
any circumstance, including (a) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right that such Lender may have
against the Swing Line Lender, the Company or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever, (b) the occurrence or continuance of a
Default, or (c) any other occurrence, event or condition,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing; provided ,
however , that each Lender’s obligation to make
Revolving Loans pursuant to this Section 2.04(c) is
subject to the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 .
No such purchase or funding of risk participations shall relieve or
otherwise impair the obligation of the Company to repay Swing Line
Loans, together with interest as provided herein.

(d) Repayment of
Participations .

(i) At any time after any Lender has
purchased and funded a risk participation in a Swing Line Loan, if
the Swing Line Lender receives any payment on account of such Swing
Line Loan, the Swing Line Lender will distribute to such Lender its
Pro Rata Share of such payment (appropriately adjusted, in the case
of interest payments, to reflect the period of time during which
such Lender’s risk participation was funded) in the same
funds as those received by the Swing Line Lender.

(ii) If any payment received by the
Swing Line Lender in respect of principal or interest on any Swing
Line Loan is required to be returned by the Swing Line Lender under
any of the circumstances described in Section 11.06
(including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Swing
Line Lender in its discretion), each Lender shall pay to the Swing
Line Lender its Pro Rata Share thereof on demand of the
Administrative Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of
such demand to the date such amount is returned, at a rate per
annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in
effect. The Administrative Agent will make such demand upon the
request of the Swing Line Lender. The obligations of the Lenders
under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the
Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.

(e) Interest for Account of Swing
Line Lender . The Swing Line Lender shall be responsible for
invoicing the Company for interest on the Swing Line Loans. Until
each Lender funds its Base Rate Loans or risk participation
pursuant to this Section 2.04 to refinance such
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of any Swing Line Loan, interest in
respect of such Pro Rata Share shall be solely for the account of
the Swing Line Lender.

(f) Payments Directly to Swing
Line Lender . The Company shall make all payments of principal
and interest in respect of the Swing Line Loans directly to the
Swing Line Lender.
 
53



(g) Extensions . If any
Maturity Date applicable to any Commitments shall have occurred at
a time when another tranche or tranches of Commitments is or are in
effect with a longer Maturity Date (such earlier Maturity Date, the
“ Earlier Maturity Date ”), then, on the Earlier
Maturity Date, all then outstanding Swing Line Loans shall be
repaid in full (and there shall be no adjustment to the
participations in such Swing Line Loans as a result of the
occurrence of the Earlier Maturity Date).

2.05
Prepayments.

(a) Voluntary Prepayments of
Loans .

(i) Revolving Loans . Each
Borrower may, upon notice from the Company to the Administrative
Agent at any time or from time to time voluntarily prepay Revolving
Loans in whole or in part without premium or penalty;

Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. (A) three
(3) Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of
Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in Dollars, (B) four

Rate Loans; (B) any such prepayment of Loans other than Base
Rate Loans shall be in a principal amount of $1,000,000 or a whole
multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof (or (x) if less, the
entire principal amount thereof then outstanding or (y) with
respect to Alternative Currencies, unless the Administrative Agent
otherwise agrees in its sole discretion, the Dollar Equivalent
thereof) and (C) any such prepayment of Base Rate Loans shall
be in a principal amount of $500,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or, if less, the entire principal
amount thereof then outstanding). Each such notice shall specify
the date and amount of such prepayment and the Type(s) of Loans to
be prepaid and, if Loans other than Base Rate Loans are to be
prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Loans. The Administrative
Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such
notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s Pro Rata Share of
such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Company, the
applicable Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment
amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the
date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Eurocurrency Rate Loan
or a Canadian BA Rate Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued
interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional
amounts required pursuant to Section 3.05 . Subject to
Section 2.15 , each such prepayment shall be applied to
the Loans of the Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro
Rata Shares.

(ii) Swing Line Loans . The
Company may, upon notice to the Swing Line Lender (with a copy to
the Administrative Agent), at any time or from time to time,
voluntarily prepay Swing Line Loans in whole or in part without
premium or penalty; provided that (A) such notice must
be received by the Swing Line Lender and the Administrative Agent
not later than 1:00 p.m. on the date of the prepayment, and
(B) any such prepayment shall be in a minimum principal amount
of $100,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof (or,
if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding).
Each such notice shall specify the date and amount of such
prepayment. If such notice is given by the Company, the Company
shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such
notice shall be due and payable on the date specified
therein.
 
54



(b) Mandatory Prepayments of
Loans .

(i) Aggregate Revolving
Commitments. If for any reason the (1) Total Revolving
Outstandings at any time exceed the Aggregate Revolving Commitments
then in effect; (2) the Total Revolving Outstandings in
respect of which Designated Borrowers are primarily obligated
exceeds the Designated Borrower Sublimit or (3) to the extent
the Administrative Agent and/or the Lenders or L/C Issuers, as
applicable, have imposed a limit on the Dollar Equivalent amount of
Loans or Letters of Credit, as the case may be, with respect to any
Alternative Currency, the Total Revolving Outstandings denominated
in such Alternative Currency at any time exceed such limit, the
applicable Borrower shall, in each case, immediately prepay
Revolving Loans and/or the Swing Line Loans and/or Cash
Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an aggregate amount equal to
such excess; provided , however , that no Borrower
shall be required to Cash Collateralize the L/C Obligations
pursuant to this Section 2.05(b)(i)(B) unless after the
prepayment in full of the Revolving Loans and Swing Line Loans the
Total Revolving Outstandings exceed the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments then in effect. The Administrative Agent may, at any
time and from time to time after the initial deposit of such Cash
Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral be provided in
order to protect against the results of further exchange rate
fluctuations.

(ii) Involuntary Dispositions
. Each Borrower agrees to prepay the Loans and Cash Collateralize
the L/C Obligations made to or issued for the account of such
Borrower as hereafter provided in an aggregate amount equal to 100%
of the Net Cash Proceeds of all Involuntary Dispositions to the
extent (a) such Net Cash Proceeds are not reinvested in the
same or similar Property within 180 days of the date of such
Disposition and (b) the aggregate amount of such Net Cash
Proceeds not reinvested in accordance with the foregoing
clause (a) shall exceed $2,500,000 in any fiscal year. Such
prepayment shall be due immediately upon the expiration of the 180
day period set forth in clause (a) (to the extent such
prepayment exceeds the threshold in clause (B)) and shall be
applied as set forth in clause (iii) below.

(iii) Application of Mandatory
Prepayments . All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this
Section 2.05(b) shall be applied to Revolving Loans and
Swing Line Loans and (after all Revolving Loans and all Swing Line
Loans have been repaid) to Cash Collateralize L/C Obligations.
Within the parameters of the applications set forth above,
prepayments shall be applied first to Base Rate Loans and Canadian
Prime Rate Loans and then to Loans other than Base Rate Loans and
Canadian Prime Rate Loans in direct order of Interest Period
maturities. All prepayments under this Section 2.05(b)
shall be subject to Section 3.05 , but otherwise
without premium or penalty, and shall be accompanied by interest on
the principal amount prepaid through the date of
prepayment.

2.06 Termination or Reduction
of Aggregate Revolving Commitments.

(a) Optional Reductions . The
Company may, upon notice to the Administrative Agent, terminate the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments or from time to time permanently
reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments to an amount not less
than the Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans, Swing Line Loans
and L/C Obligations; provided that (i) any such notice
shall be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00
a.m. five (5) Business Days prior to the date of termination
or reduction, (ii) any such partial reduction shall be in an
aggregate amount of $1,000,000 or any whole multiple of $250,000 in
excess thereof, (iii) the Company shall not terminate or
reduce the Aggregate Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect
thereto and to any concurrent prepayments hereunder, the Total
Revolving Outstandings would exceed the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments and (iv) if, after giving effect to any reduction
of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments,
 
55


the Alternative Currency Sublimit, the Letter of
Credit Sublimit, the Designated Borrower Sublimit or the Swing Line
Sublimit exceeds the amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments,
such Sublimit shall be automatically reduced by the amount of such
excess.

(b) Notice . The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Lenders of any
termination or reduction of the Letter of Credit Sublimit, Swing
Line Sublimit, Alternative Currency Sublimit, Designated Borrower
Sublimit or Aggregate Revolving Commitments under this
Section 2.06 . Subject to Section 2.15 ,
upon any reduction of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments, the
Revolving Commitment of each Lender shall be reduced by such
Lender’s Pro Rata Share of such reduction amount. All fees in
respect of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments accrued until the
effective date of any termination of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitments shall be paid on the effective date of such
termination. Any notice of termination of the Aggregate Revolving
Commitment in whole delivered by the Company pursuant to this
Section may state that such notice is conditioned upon the
consummation of financing that will refinance the credit facility
provided by this Agreement, in which case such notice may be
revoked by the Company if such condition is not satisfied (by
notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent on or prior to
the specified effective date).

2.07 Repayment of
Loans.

(a) Revolving Loans . Each
Borrower shall repay to the Lenders on the Maturity Date the

as of the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, any L/C Obligation for
any reason remains outstanding (including the issuance by an L/C
Issuer of a Letter of Credit with an expiry date after the Letter
of Credit Expiration Date), the Company shall immediately Cash
Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C
Obligations.

2.08
Interest.

(a) Subject to the provisions of
subsection (b) below, (i) each Eurocurrency Rate Loan
shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for
each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the
Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period plus the
Applicable Rate plus (in the case of a Eurocurrency Rate
Loan of any Lender which is lent from a Lending Office in the
United Kingdom or a Participating Member State) the Mandatory Cost,
(ii) each Canadian BA Rate Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a
rate per annum equal to the sum of the Canadian BA Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate, (iii) each
Canadian Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing date at a
rate per annum equal to the sum of the Canadian Prime Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Rate, (iv) each
Base Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal
amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per
annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Rate and
(v) each Swing Line Loan shall bear interest on the
outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing

Applicable Rate.
 
56

interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times
equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

(c) If any amount (other than
principal of any Loan) payable by any Borrower under any Loan
Document is not paid when due (without regard to any applicable
grace periods), whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, then upon the request of the Required Lenders at any
time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under
Section 9.01(a) with respect thereto, such amount shall
thereafter bear interest at a fluctuating interest rate per annum
at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Laws.

(d) Accrued and unpaid interest on
past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be
due and payable upon demand.

(e) Interest on each Loan shall be
due and payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date applicable
thereto and at such other times as may be specified herein.
Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the
terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the
commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief
Law.

2.09 Fees.

In addition to certain fees
described in subsections (i) and (j) of
Section 2.03 :

(a) Commitment Fee . The
Company shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
each Lender, in Dollars, in accordance with its Pro Rata Share, a
commitment fee equal to the product of (i) the Applicable Rate
times (ii) the actual daily amount by which the
Aggregate Revolving Commitments exceed the sum of (y) the
Outstanding Amount of Revolving Loans and (z) the Outstanding
Amount of L/C Obligations; provided that (A) no
Commitment Fee shall accrue on the Revolving Commitment of a
Defaulting Lender so long as such Lender shall be a Defaulting
Lender and (B) any Commitment Fee accrued with respect to the
Revolving Commitment of a Defaulting Lender during the period prior
to the time such Lender became a Defaulting Lender and unpaid at
such time shall not be payable by the Company so long as such
Lender shall be a Defaulting Lender. The commitment fee shall
accrue at all times during the Availability Period, including at
any time during which one or more of the conditions in
Article V is not met, and shall be due and payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing with the first such date to
occur after the Closing Date, and on the Maturity Date. The
commitment fee shall be calculated quarterly in arrears, and if
there is any change in the Applicable Rate during any quarter, the
actual daily amount shall be computed and multiplied by the
Applicable Rate separately for each period during such quarter that
such Applicable Rate was in effect. For the avoidance of doubt,
Swing Line Loans shall not be counted towards or considered usage
of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments for purposes of computing
the commitment fee in accordance with this
Section 2.09(a) .
 
57



(b) Other Fees .

(i) The Company shall pay to the
Joint Lead Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own
respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified
in the Engagement Letter. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid
and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.

(ii) The Company shall pay to the
Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in
writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees
shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any
reason whatsoever.

2.10 Computation of Interest
and Fees.

(a) All computations of interest for
(i) Base Rate Loans and (ii) Canadian Prime Rate Loans or
Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by reference to
Bank of America’s “ prime rate ” shall be
made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be,
and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and
interest shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual
days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as
applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day
year) or, in the case of interest in respect of Loans denominated
in Alternative Currencies as to which market practice differs from
the foregoing, in accordance with such market practice as
determined by the Administrative Agent. Interest shall accrue on
each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not
accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the
Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is
repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.12(a) , bear interest for one day. Each
determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or
fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error.

(b) If, as a result of any
restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of
the Company or for any other reason, the Company or the Required
Lenders determine that (i) the Consolidated Total Leverage
Ratio as calculated by the Company as of any applicable date was
inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Consolidated
Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such
period, each Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be
obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
applicable Lenders or applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be,
promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the
occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with
respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United
States, automatically and without further action by the
Administrative Agent, any Lender or the L/C Issuer), an amount
equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should
have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees
actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the
rights of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, under Section 2.03(c)(iii) ,
2.03(h) or 2.08(b) or under Article IX. Each
Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the
termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments and the
repayment of all other Obligations hereunder.

2.11 Evidence of
Debt.

(a) The Credit Extensions made by
each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records
maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the
ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by
the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent
manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the
Lenders to
 
58


the Borrowers and the interest and payments
thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall
not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the
Borrowers hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the
Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of
the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts
and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the
absence of manifest error. Upon the request of any Lender made
through the Administrative Agent, the applicable Borrower shall
execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative
Agent) a promissory note, which shall evidence such Lender’s
Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each such promissory
note shall (i) in the case of Revolving Loans denominated in
Dollars, be in the form of Exhibit C-1 (a “
Revolving Note ”) and (ii) in the case of Swing
Line Loans, be in the form of Exhibit C-2 (a “
Swing Line Note ”) and (iii) in the case of
Revolving Loans denominated in a Alternative Currency, be in a form
reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Each Lender may
attach schedules to its Note and endorse thereon the date, Type (if
applicable), amount and maturity of its Loans and payments with
respect thereto.

(b) In addition to the accounts and
records referred to in subsection (a), each Lender and the
Administrative Agent shall maintain in accordance with its usual
practice accounts or records evidencing the purchases and sales by
such Lender of participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and
records maintained by the Administrative Agent and the accounts and
records of any Lender in respect of such matters, the accounts and
records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of
manifest error.

2.12 Payments Generally;
Administrative Agent’s Clawback.

(a) General . All payments to
be made by any Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without
condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or
setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, and except
with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in
an Alternative Currency, all payments by any Borrower hereunder
shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the
respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the applicable
Administrative Agent’s Office in Dollars and in Same Day
Funds not later than 2:00 p.m. on the date specified herein. Except
as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by any
Borrower hereunder with respect to principal and interest on Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made to the
Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to
which such payment is owed, at the applicable Administrative
Agent’s Office in such Alternative Currency and in Same Day
Funds not later than the Applicable Time specified by the
Administrative Agent on the dates specified herein. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent
may require that any payments due under this Agreement be made in
the United States. If, for any reason, any Borrower is prohibited
by any Law from making any required payment hereunder in an
Alternative Currency, such Borrower shall make such payment in
Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency
payment amount. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute
to each Lender its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as
provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire
transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments
received by the Administrative Agent (i) after 2:00 p.m., in
the case of payments in Dollars or (ii) after the Applicable
Time specified by the Administrative Agent in the case of payments
in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received
on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or
fee shall continue to accrue. Subject to the definition of
“Interest Period”, if any payment to be made by a
Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment
shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such
extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees,
as the case may be.

(b) (i) Funding by Lenders;
Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the
proposed date of any
 
59


Borrowing of Eurocurrency Rate Loans (or, in the
case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, prior to 12:00 noon on
the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make
available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of
such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such
Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance
with Section 2.02 (or, in the case of any Borrowing of
Base Rate Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in
accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02 ) and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a
corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the
Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the applicable
Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is made available to the applicable Borrower to but
excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at
(A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the
Overnight Rate, plus any administrative or similar fees customarily
charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the
foregoing, (B) in the case of a payment to be made by a
Borrower in Dollars, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate
Loans, (C) in the case of a payment to be made by a Borrower
in Canadian Dollars, the interest rate applicable to Canadian Prime
Rate Loans and (D) in the case of a payment to be made by a
Borrower in any currency other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars,
the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency Rate Loans. If a
Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the
Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the
Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the applicable
Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such
period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing
to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any
payment by a Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim such
Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make
such payment to the Administrative Agent.

(ii) Payments by Borrower;
Presumptions by Administrative Agent . Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower
prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative
Agent for the account of the Lenders or any L/C Issuer hereunder
that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such
date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such
assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the applicable L/C Issuer,
as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if such Borrower
has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
applicable L/C Issuer, as the case may be, severally agrees to
repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so
distributed to such Lender or such L/C Issuer, in Same Day Funds
with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date
such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of
payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Overnight
Rate.

A notice of the Administrative Agent
to any Lender or any Borrower with respect to any amount due to the
Administrative Agent under this subsection (b) shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error.

(c) Failure to Satisfy Conditions
Precedent . If any Lender makes available to the Administrative
Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in
the foregoing provisions of this Article II , and such funds
are not made available to the applicable Borrower by the
Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable
Credit Extension set forth in Article V are not satisfied or
waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative
Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such
Lender) to such Lender, without interest.

(d) Obligations of Lenders
Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make
Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Line
Loans and to make payments pursuant to Section 11.04(b)
are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make
any
 
60


Loan, to fund any such participation or to make
any payment under Section 11.04(b) on any date required
hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding
obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its
Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under
Section 11.04(b) .

(e) Funding Source . Nothing
herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds
for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a
representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain
the funds for any Loan in any particular place or
manner.

(f) Insufficient Funds . If
at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the
Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, L/C
Borrowings, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall
be applied in accordance with Section 9.03.

2.13 Sharing of Payments
.

If any Lender shall, by exercising
any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in
respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by
it, or the participations in L/C Obligations or in Swing Line Loans
held by it (excluding any amounts applied by the Swing Line Lender
to outstanding Swing Line Loans) resulting in such Lender’s
receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such
Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than
its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender
receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the
Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash
at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in
L/C Obligations and Swing Line Loans of the other Lenders, or make
such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit
of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued
interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;
provided that:

(i) if any such participations or
subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the
payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or
subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest;
and

(ii) the provisions of this
Section 2.13 shall not be construed to apply to
(x) any payment made by or on behalf of a Borrower pursuant to
and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement
(including the application of funds arising from the existence of a
Defaulting Lender), (y) the application of Cash Collateral
provided for in Section 2.14 or (z) any payment
obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale
of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in L/C
Obligations or Swing Line Loans to any assignee or participant,
other than an assignment to any Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof
(as to which the provisions of this Section shall
apply).

Each Loan Party consents to the
foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under
applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant
to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Loan Party
rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of
such Loan Party in the amount of such participation.

2.14 Cash
Collateral.

(a) Certain Credit Support
Events . (x) (i) Upon the request of the
Administrative Agent or an L/C Issuer, if such L/C Issuer has
honored any full or partial drawing request under any Letter of
Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing or
(ii) if, as of the date that
 
61


is 30 days prior to the Latest Maturity Date
(applicable to unutilized Revolving Commitments at least equal to
outstanding L/C Obligations), any L/C Obligation for any reason
(including the issuance by an L/C Issuer of a Letter of Credit with
an expiry date after the Letter of Credit Expiration Date) remains
outstanding, the Company shall, in each case, immediately Cash
Collateralize the then Outstanding Amount of all L/C Obligations,
or (y) if the aggregate principal amount of L/C Obligations
exceeds the Letter of Credit Sublimit, the Company shall
immediately provide Cash Collateral of at least such excess amount.
At any time that there shall exist a Defaulting Lender, immediately
upon the request of the Administrative Agent, an L/C Issuer or the
Swing Line Lender, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative
Agent Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to cover all Fronting
Exposure (after giving effect to Section 2.15(a)(iv)
and any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). The
Administrative Agent may (and shall at the request of any L/C
Issuer), at any time and from time to time after the initial
deposit of Cash Collateral, request that additional Cash Collateral
be provided in order to protect against the results of exchange
rate fluctuations.

(b) Grant of Security
Interest . All Cash Collateral (other than credit support not
constituting funds subject to deposit) shall be maintained in
blocked, non-interest bearing deposit accounts at the
Administrative Agent. Each Borrower, and to the extent provided by
any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grants to
(and subjects to the control of) the Administrative Agent, for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent, the L/C Issuers and the
Lenders (including the Swing Line Lender) and agrees, in respect of
its Cash Collateral, to maintain (other than as a result of
inconsistent actions taken by the Administrative Agent), a first
priority security interest in all such cash, deposit accounts and
all balances therein, and all other property so provided as Cash
Collateral pursuant hereto and in all proceeds of the foregoing,
all as security for the obligations to which such Cash Collateral
may be applied pursuant to Section 2.14(c) . If at any
time the Administrative Agent determines that Cash Collateral is
subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the
Administrative Agent as provided herein, or that the total amount
of such Cash Collateral is less than the applicable Fronting
Exposure and other obligations secured thereby (after giving effect
to Section 2.15(a)(iv) ), the Company or the relevant
Defaulting Lender will, promptly upon demand by the Administrative
Agent, pay or provide to the Administrative Agent additional Cash
Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such
deficiency.

(c) Application .
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under any of this
Section 2.14 or Sections 2.03 , 2.04 ,
2.05 , 2.15 or 9.02 in respect of Letters of
Credit or Swing Line Loans shall be held and applied in
satisfaction of the specific L/C Obligations, Swing Line Loans,
obligations to fund participations therein (including, as to Cash
Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on
such obligation) and other obligations for which the Cash
Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such
property as may be provided herein.

(d) Release . Cash Collateral
(or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce Fronting
Exposure or other obligations shall be released promptly following
(i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure or
other obligations giving rise thereto (including by the termination
of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender (or, as
appropriate, its assignee following compliance with
Section 11.06(b)(v) ) or (ii) the Administrative
Agent’s good faith determination that there exists excess
Cash Collateral; provided , however , (x) that
Cash Collateral furnished by or on behalf of a Loan Party
(i) shall not be released during the continuance of a Default
or Event of Default (and following application as provided in this
Section 2.14 may be otherwise applied in accordance
with Section 9.03 ) and (ii) shall remain subject
to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents
unless released pursuant to another provision of the Loan
Documents, and (y) the Person providing Cash Collateral and
the applicable L/C Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable, may
agree that Cash Collateral shall not be released but instead held
to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other
obligations.

2.15 Defaulting
Lenders.

(a) Adjustments.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until
such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law:

(i) Waivers and Amendment .
Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any
amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall
be restricted as set forth in Section 11.01 and the
definition of Required Lenders.

(ii) Reallocation of Payments
. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts
received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity,
pursuant to Article IX or otherwise, and including any
amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by such
Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.08 ), shall be
applied at such time or times as may be determined by the
Administrative Agent as follows: first , to the payment of
any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder; second , to the payment on a pro
rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to
an L/C Issuer or to the Swing Line Lender hereunder; third ,
if so determined by the Administrative Agent or requested by an L/C
Issuer or the Swing Line Lender, to Cash Collateralize the L/C
Issuers’ Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting
Lender in accordance with Section 2.14 ; fourth
, as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of
Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which
such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as
required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative
Agent; fifth , if so determined by the Administrative Agent
and the Company, to be held in a non-interest bearing deposit
account and released in order to (i) satisfy obligations of
such Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement and
(ii) Cash Collaterali

1 Morningstar, as of 12/31/2016. Post-tax comparison between the 1, 3 and 5 year returns at NAV of the iShares Core ETFs and the oldest share class of active open-end mutual funds within the same Morningstar categories as the iShares Core ETFs. Mutual funds are generally more tax inefficient than ETFs and, as a result, are typically more negatively impacted than ETFs when comparing performance based on post-tax returns rather than total returns. The number of ETFs and mutual funds used for each period varies based on the inception date of the iShares Core ETFs. iShares Core ETFs included in this comparison vary based on the time period analyzed: 1 year (19 Core ETFs existed for the full 1-year period ended 1/31/15); 3 year (15 Core ETFs existed for the full 3-year period ended 1/31/13); and 5 year (9 Core ETFs existed for the full 5-year period ended 1/31/11). iShares Core ETFs outperformed their active mutual fund peers by 77.5% (1955/2426), 84.6% (1804/2157) and 79.9% (1330/1515) over the 1, 3 and 5 year periods ended 12/31/16, respectively. Performance was averaged for Morningstar categories containing more than one iShares fund, and may be different for other time periods. Returns are calculated after taxes on distributions, including capital gains and dividends, assuming the highest federal tax rate for each type of distribution in effect at the time of the distribution. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Review the differences between iShares ETFs and mutual funds for more information.2 BlackRock, as of 3/31/17. Based on 815 ETFs and $1.42 trillion in assets under management globally.






 
Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses, which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.







Transactions in shares of ETFs will result in brokerage commissions and will generate tax consequences. All regulated investment companies are obliged to distribute portfolio gains to shareholders.






Investment comparisons are for illustrative purposes only. To better understand the similarities and differences between investments, including investment objectives, risks, fees and expenses, it is important to read the products' prospectuses.






The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).
