Xylitol – 454 g – 1 lb. Bag


Category: WOW Xilitol






						Description
					



Product Description
Xylitol is a natural pentitol sugar alcohol. It does not contain the glucose based carbohydrate sweetener found in sucrose, corn sugars, fructose etc. More correctly,
Xylitol is classified as a polyalcohol which can be converted into a natural sugar. Due to the basic chemistry of Xylitol one perceives a pleasant and fresh sensation rather than the traditional burn of sugar. Xylan is the raw material source of Xylitol which is found in some tree bark and in the hulls of several nuts and grains.
Many fruits and vegetables are another source of Xylan making it a natural sweetener that works well with the body.
