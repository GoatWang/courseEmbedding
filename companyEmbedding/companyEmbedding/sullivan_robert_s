Overview




Robert Sullivan’s primary practice areas include product liability, environmental law and insurance coverage.
Product Liability Robert’s product liability practice primarily involves defending foreign and domestic tire manufacturers in high-exposure matters. Specifically, he works with a partner as the foreign clients’ national counsel. Robert oversees local counsel’s handling of the claims and works directly with them on developing defense strategies; communicates with the client’s expert team on defense- and strategy-related issues; and develops approaches to deconstructing the plaintiffs’ expert opinions.
Environmental Robert’s environmental practice focuses on state and federal environmental litigation, administrative proceedings, compliance and real estate transactions. He has experience with matters under the jurisdiction of the main federal environmental statutes (CERCLA, RCRA, CWA, TSCA and FIFRA). Robert has also handled matters dealing with various state environmental statutes (e.g., New York Navigation Law). Additionally, he has counseled clients on environmentally related workplace issues under the regulation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Specifically, Robert has conducted numerous facility audits to advise clients on potential environmental and OSHA liability.
Insurance Coverage Robert’s insurance coverage practice includes coverage analysis and coverage opinions for insurers and preparing coverage denial and reservation of rights letters. Robert also assesses potential exposure and litigates insurance-coverage lawsuits.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1919 edition. Volume: no.773 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper.

Item Description: HarperCollins Publishers Ltd, 1988. Paperback. Book Condition: Used; Acceptable. Dispatched, from the UK, within 48 hours of ordering. The book is perfectly readable and fit for use, although it shows signs of previous ownership. The spine is likely creased and the cover scuffed or slightly torn. Textbooks will typically have an amount of underlining and/or highlighting, as well as notes. If this book is over 5 years old, then please expect the pages to be yellowing or to have age spots. Ex-library book. This is an ex-library book and therefore has stamps throughout. It is also likely to have considerable shelf-ware. It is however still in useable condition, and a great read. Thanks.  Bookseller Inventory # CHL2081542

About the Dean





Welcome Message from Dean Sullivan Dean's Advisory Council

Robert S. Sullivan joined the Rady School of Management at UC San Diego as its founding dean in January 2003. Dr. Sullivan is an expert on entrepreneurship, knowledge management, and operations management.
Dr. Sullivan has successfully recruited top-tier faculty, from universities such as the University of Chicago, MIT, New York University, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, the Wharton School and Yale. Under Dr. Sullivan’s leadership, the Beyster Institute was integrated with the Rady School, thereby increasing the school’s brand in San Diego and throughout the world. Dr. Sullivan is immediate past Chair of the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International), the premier accrediting body for business education. During Dr. Sullivan’s tenure, the Rady School moved to Otterson Hall in June 2007 and opened the school’s campus expansion, Wells Fargo Hall, in May 2012.
Prior to joining UC San Diego, Dr. Sullivan was dean of the Kenan-Flagler Business School of The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. From 1995 to 1997, Dr. Sullivan served as director of the University of Texas at Austin’s IC2 Institute, a nontraditional international center for research and education on innovation, creativity, capital and commercialization. He held the J. Marion West Chair for Constructive Capitalism in the university’s Graduate School of Business. Dr. Sullivan served as dean of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University from 1991 to 1995. During his tenure, the school’s rankings rose dramatically. He led a reengineering of the school’s educational programs, including integrating advanced technology into the field of finance and creating experiential and international distance-learning opportunities for students.
From 1976 to 1991, Dr. Sullivan served in a variety of posts at the University of Texas, including the Joe B. Cook professor of management and associate dean for research and academic affairs in the Graduate School of Business. He was co-director of the Center for Technology Venturing, director of the Bureau of Business Research and director of the Manufacturing Systems Engineering Program in the College of Engineering. Dr. Sullivan was a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia from 1968 to 1970, where he worked as a lecturer in production management in the College of Business Administration at Haile Selassie I University in Addis Ababa (now Addis Ababa University).
Dr. Sullivan holds a doctorate in operations management from Pennsylvania State University, a master’s degree in production management and quantitative methods from Cornell University and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Boston College.
