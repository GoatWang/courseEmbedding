LivaNova PLC UK Regulatory Announcement: LivaNova Plc – Product remediation plan related to 3T Heater Cooler device. | Business Wire


























































      LivaNova Plc – Product remediation plan related to 3T Heater Cooler 
      device.
    





March 01, 2017 06:30 AM Eastern Standard Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

RNS – LivaNova Plc - Product remediation plan related to 3T Heater 
      Cooler device


THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION.


      1 March 2017
    

LivaNova Plc – Product remediation plan related to 3T Heater Cooler 
      device


      In respect of its consolidated financial statements under US GAAP as of 
      and for the year ended 31 December 2016, LivaNova PLC (the “Company”) 
      has recognized a liability under US GAAP in the amount of $33.5 million 
      for a product remediation plan related to its 3T Heater Cooler device. 
      The remediation plan developed by the Company consists primarily of a 
      modification of the 3T Heater Cooler design to include internal sealing 
      and the addition of a vacuum system to new and existing devices. These 
      changes are intended to address regulatory actions and further reduce 
      the risk of possible dispersion of aerosols from the 3T Heater Cooler 
      device in hospital operating rooms. The deployment of this solution for 
      commercially distributed devices will commence upon final validation and 
      verification of the design changes and approval or clearance by 
      regulatory authorities worldwide.
    

      As part of this plan, the Company also intends to implement a no-charge 
      deep disinfection service for 3T Heater Cooler users who have reported 
      confirmed M. chimaera mycobacterium contamination. The Company 
      anticipates expanding the deep disinfection service globally as 
      regulatory approvals are received.
    

      Finally, in the fourth quarter of 2016 the Company initiated a program 
      to loan existing 3T Heater Cooler users a new 3T Heater Cooler device at 
      no charge pending regulatory approval and implementation of the vacuum 
      system addition and deep disinfection service worldwide. This loaner 
      program began in the United States and is being made available 
      progressively on a global basis, prioritizing and allocating devices to 
      3T Heater Cooler users based on pre-established criteria.
    

      In addition to $4.0 million of costs under US GAAP incurred during the 
      twelve month period ended December 31, 2016, the Company also recognized 
      a $33.5 million liability under US GAAP at 31 December 2016. These costs 
      all relate to the execution of the remediation plan, including (i) 
      finalization and implementation of the design change, (ii) provision of 
      deep disinfection services, and (iii) the provision of loaner 3T Heater 
      Cooler devices.

[Posted 10/13/2016]AUDIENCE: Risk Manager, Cardiology, Surgery, Infectious Disease, NursingISSUE: FDA is updating its June 1, 2016 Safety Communication to provide new information about Mycobacterium chimaera (M. chimaera) infections associated with the use of the Stӧckert 3T Heater-Cooler System (3T) in U.S. patients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgeries. This communication also contains updated recommendations to help prevent the spread of infection related to the use of these devices. For the complete list of recommendations, see the updated FDA Safety Communication.BACKGROUND: Heater-cooler devices are commonly used during cardiothoracic surgeries, as well as other medical and surgical procedures, to warm or cool a patient in order to optimize medical care and improve patient outcomes. Heater-cooler devices have water tanks that provide temperature-controlled water to external heat exchangers or warming/cooling blankets through closed circuits. Although the water in the circuits does not come into direct contact with the patient, there is the potential for contaminated water to enter other parts of the device and aerosolize, transmitting bacteria through the air and through the device's exhaust vent into the environment and to the patient. In October 2015, the FDA issued a Safety Communication to provide recommendations to help minimize patient risk of infections associated with heater-cooler devices. Since issuing that communication, the FDA has continued to evaluate the causes and risk factors for transmission of microbial agents associated with heater-cooler devices and has collaborated with professional societies, public health partners, and experts to develop strategies to minimize patient exposure.RECOMMENDATIONS: UPDATED recommendations for health care facilities and staff:If your facility uses 3T devices, you should:Immediately remove from service any heater-cooler devices, accessories, tubing, and connectors that have tested positive for M. chimaera or have been associated with known M. chimaera patient infections at your facility.Use new accessories, tubing, and connectors to prevent recontamination when using a different heater-cooler device.Direct and channel the heater-cooler exhaust away from the patient, e.g., to the operating room exhaust vent.Be aware that device contamination also may occur from other sources such as environmental contamination or device contact with contaminated accessories. Review the recommendations in CDC's Health AdvisoryBe aware that heater-cooler devices are important in patient care. In appropriately selected patients, the benefits of temperature control during open chest cardiothoracic procedures generally outweigh the risk of infection transmission associated with the use of these devices.If your facility has 3T devices manufactured prior to September 2014, you should:Strongly consider transitioning away from the use of these devices for open-chest cardiac surgery until the manufacturer has implemented strategies for these devices to mitigate the risks of patient infection. ◦Use of these devices should be limited to emergent and/or life-threatening situations if no other heater cooler devices are available.Follow the FDA's earlier recommendations to help mitigate the risks of patient infection.Be aware that testing of heater-cooler devices to identify units contaminated with M. chimaera presents technical challenges related to sample collection, the long culture time, and the high rate of false negative tests. Therefore, it is not recommended at this time.If your facility has 3T devices manufactured after September 2014, you should:Follow the FDA's earlier recommendations to help mitigate the risks of patient infection.Be aware that testing of heater-cooler devices to identify units contaminated with M. chimaera presents technical challenges related to sample collection, the long culture time, and the high rate of false negative tests. Therefore, it is not recommended at this time.Healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse events or side effects related to the use of these products to the FDA's MedWatch Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program:Complete and submit the report Online: www.fda.gov/MedWatch/reportDownload form or call 1-800-332-1088 to request a reporting form, then complete and return to the address on the pre-addressed form, or submit by fax to 1-800-FDA-0178[10/13/2016 - Safety Communication - FDA] [10/13/2016 - Press Release: Contaminated Devices Used during Heart Surgery Putting Patients at Risk - CDC] [10/13/2016 - Health Alert Network Advisory: CDC Advices Hospitals to Alert Patients at Risk from Contaminated Heater-Cooler Devices Used during Cardiac Surgery - CDC ] [10/13/2016 - Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR): Mycobacterium chimaera Contamination of Heater-Cooler Devices Used I Cardiac Surgery - CDC]Previous MedWatch Alert:[06/01/2016 - Stӧckert 3T Heater-Cooler System by Sorin Group Deustchland GmbH: Safety Communication - Reports of Mycobacterium Chimaera Infections]

The FDA is updating its June 1, 2016 Safety Communication to provide new information about Mycobacterium chimaera (M. chimaera) infections associated with the use of the 3T in U.S. patients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgeries. This communication also contains updated recommendations to help prevent the spread of infection related to the use of these devices.October 13, 2016Audiences:Health care providers who use 3T Heater-Cooler SystemPrimary care providers who are responsible for the ongoing care of patients who have undergone cardiothoracic  surgeryPatients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgeryHospital staff who are responsible for operating and maintaining 3T Heater-Cooler SystemHealth care facilities that perform procedures using the 3T Heater-Cooler SystemMedical Specialties: Cardiothoracic Surgeons, Cardiovascular Surgeons, Orthopedic Surgeons, Neurosurgeons, General Surgeons, Anesthesiologists, Infection Control, Infectious Disease Physicians, Pediatrics, Primary Care, and Intensive Care PhysiciansProduct: The Stӧckert 3T Heater-Cooler System (3T), manufactured by LivaNova PLC (formerly Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH), is intended to provide temperature-controlled water to 1) oxygenator heat exchangers, 2) cardioplegia (paralysis of the heart) heat exchangers, and/or 3) warming/cooling blankets to warm or cool a patient during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures lasting six hours or less.Purpose: The FDA is updating its June 1, 2016 Safety Communication to provide new information about Mycobacterium chimaera (M. chimaera) infections associated with the use of the 3T in U.S. patients who have undergone cardiothoracic surgeries. This communication also contains updated recommendations to help prevent the spread of infection related to the use of these devices.  As the FDA continues to investigate infections associated with the 3T, we believe health care facilities should take additional steps to help mitigate the risk of infection associated with the use of these devicesSummary of Problem and Scope: Heater-cooler devices are commonly used during cardiothoracic surgeries, as well as other medical and surgical procedures, to warm or cool a patient in order to optimize medical care and improve patient outcomes. Heater-cooler devices have water tanks that provide temperature-controlled water to external heat exchangers or warming/cooling blankets through closed circuits. Although the water in the circuits does not come into direct contact with the patient, there is the potential for contaminated water to enter other parts of the device and aerosolize, transmitting bacteria through the air and through the device's exhaust vent into the environment and to the patient. In October 2015, the FDA issued a Safety Communication to provide recommendations to help minimize patient risk of infections associated with heater-cooler devices. Since issuing that communication, the FDA has continued to evaluate the causes and risk factors for transmission of microbial agents associated with heater-cooler devices and has collaborated with professional societies, public health partners, and experts to develop strategies to minimize patient exposure.A European study1 published in April 2016 describes a link between M. chimaera clinical samples from several European infected cardiothoracic patients, samples from the heater-cooler devices used during these patient's procedures, and environmental samples from the device manufacturer's production and servicing facility in Germany. The results of this paper suggest a direct link between the M. chimaera that infected European patients during open-chest cardiac surgery, and the M. chimaera isolated from the 3T heater-cooler model utilized during these patients' surgeries.M. chimaera is a type of nontuberculous mycobacterium (NTM) classified as a slow grower. M. chimaera may cause serious illness or death. The FDA believes M. chimaera infections associated with the 3T are rare.  However, they are difficult to detect because infected patients may not develop symptoms or signs of infection for months to years after initial exposure.On June 1, 2016, the FDA issued a Safety Communication specific to M. chimaera infections associated with the use of the 3T. Testing conducted by the manufacturer in August 2014 found M. chimaera contamination on the production line and water supply at the 3T manufacturing facility. The 3T devices manufactured at this facility were distributed worldwide. In response to the M. chimaera findings in August 2014, the manufacturer added cleaning and disinfection procedures to the production line in September 2014. Samples taken at the same manufacturing facility, by the German Regulatory Authorities in July 2015 did not show M. chimaera, potentially indicating the contamination at the manufacturing facility had been resolved. Although the manufacturer of 3T devices added cleaning and disinfection procedures to the production line in September 2014, the FDA is now aware of some 3T devices manufactured after September 2014 which have tested positive for M. chimaera. It has not been confirmed whether these devices were contaminated at the manufacturing facility or became contaminated at the user facility. To date, the FDA is not aware of M. chimaera patient infections associated with 3T devices that were manufactured after September 2014.The June 1, 2016 Safety Communication also stated the FDA received reports of U.S. patients infected with M. chimaera after undergoing cardiothoracic surgery that involved use of the 3T devices. Each of those reports related to 3T devices that were manufactured prior to September 2014.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in conjunction with National Jewish Health has performed whole genome sequencing on clinical isolates from infected patients and samples taken from the 3T devices from hospitals representing geographically distinct regions within the U.S. (Pennsylvania and Iowa) where clusters of patient infections with M. chimaera were identified. Each of the isolates tested were associated with devices manufactured before September 2014. Samples of the water drained from the 3T devices and air samples collected while the devices were in operation were also tested. The results obtained strongly suggest that the tested 3T devices had a common source of M. chimaera contamination. Sequence comparisons between U.S. and European Union (EU) samples, as well as samples from the manufacturing site, would provide additional information in evaluating the potential for point source contamination at the production site. However, EU sequencing results have not been shared to date.As new information becomes available, the FDA will evaluate the information and update its recommendations, as appropriate.UPDATED Recommendations for Health Care Facilities and Staff:If your facility uses 3T devices, you should:Immediately remove from service any heater-cooler devices, accessories, tubing, and connectors that have tested positive for M. chimaera or have been associated with known M. chimaera patient infections at your facility. Use new accessories, tubing, and connectors to prevent recontamination when using a different heater-cooler device.Direct and channel the heater-cooler exhaust away from the patient, e.g., to the operating room exhaust vent. Be aware that device contamination also may occur from other sources such as environmental contamination or device contact with contaminated accessories.  Review the recommendations in CDC's Health AdvisoryBe aware that heater-cooler devices are important in patient care. In appropriately selected patients, the benefits of temperature control during open chest cardiothoracic procedures generally outweigh the risk of infection transmission associated with the use of these devices. If your facility has 3T devices manufactured prior to September 2014, you should:Strongly consider transitioning away from the use of these devices for open-chest cardiac surgery until the manufacturer has implemented strategies for these devices to mitigate the risks of patient infection. Use of these devices should be limited to emergent and/or life-threatening situations if no other heater cooler devices are available.Follow the FDA's earlier recommendations to help mitigate the risks of patient infection. Be aware that testing of heater-cooler devices to identify units contaminated with M. chimaera presents technical challenges related to sample collection, the long culture time, and the high rate of false negative tests. Therefore, it is not recommended at this time. If your facility has 3T devices manufactured after September 2014, you should:Follow the FDA's earlier recommendations to help mitigate the risks of patient infection.Be aware that testing of heater-cooler devices to identify units contaminated with M. chimaera presents technical challenges related to sample collection, the long culture time, and the high rate of false negative tests. Therefore, it is not recommended at this time.The FDA recommends facilities and staff using heater-cooler units CONTINUE to implement the following measures to help reduce risk to patients:Strictly adhere to the cleaning and disinfection instructions provided in the manufacturer's device labeling. Ensure you have the most current version of the manufacturers' instructions for use readily available to promote adherence.Do not use tap water to rinse, fill, refill or top-off water tanks since this may introduce NTM organisms. Use only sterile water or water that has been passed through a filter of less than or equal to 0.22 microns. When making ice needed for patient cooling during surgical procedures use only sterile water or water that has been passed through a filter of less than or equal to 0.22 microns. Deionized water and sterile water created through reverse osmosis is not recommended because it may promote corrosion of the metal components of the system.Direct the heater-cooler's vent exhaust away from the surgical field to mitigate the risk of aerosolizing heater-cooler tank water into the sterile field and exposing the patient.Establish regular cleaning, disinfection and maintenance schedules for heater-cooler devices according to the manufacturers' instructions to minimize the risk of bacterial growth and subsequent patient infection.Develop and follow a comprehensive quality control program for maintenance, cleaning, and disinfection of heater-cooler devices. Your program may include written procedures for monitoring adherence to the program and documenting set up, cleaning, and disinfection processes before and after use.Immediately remove from service heater-cooler devices that show discoloration or cloudiness in the fluid lines/circuits, which may indicate bacterial growth. Consult your hospital infection control officials to perform the appropriate follow up measures and report events of device contamination to the manufacturer and to the FDA via MedWatch.Consider performing environmental, air, and water sampling and monitoring if heater-cooler contamination is suspected. Environmental monitoring requires specialized expertise and equipment to collect and process samples, which may not be feasible in all facilities.Health care facilities should follow their internal procedures for notifying and culturing patients if they suspect infection associated with heater-cooler devices.Submit a report to the manufacturer and to the FDA via MedWatch, if you suspect heater-cooler devices have been associated with patient infections.Recommendations for Patients:Be aware that: in the U.S., most cardiopulmonary bypass procedures involve the use of a heater-cooler device.heater-cooler devices are important in patient care and, in appropriately selected patients, the benefits of temperature control  necessary during open chest cardiothoracic proceduresgenerally outweigh the risk of infection transmission associated with using these devices.the FDA has received reports of patient infections associated with exposure to M. chimaera when contaminated 3T heater-cooler device were used during surgery.M. chimaera infections are difficult to detect because infected patients may not develop symptoms or signs of infection for months to years after initial exposure.there may be an increased risk of infection if you received a heart valve, graft, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), or any other prosthetic product/material or had a heart transplant.If you have undergone cardiopulmonary bypass, be aware of the possible signs and symptoms of NTM infection. These may include: fatiguefeverpainredness, heat, or pus at the surgical sitemuscle painjoint painnight sweatsweight lossabdominal painnauseavomitingIf you have undergone a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure and are experiencing any of the signs and symptoms of NTM infection as outlined above, contact your health care provider as soon as possible.If you are not currently experiencing any changes in your general health, inform your health care provider during your next wellness visit that you have undergone a cardiopulmonary bypass procedure to determine if you require further testing or monitoring for possible exposure to NTM.Additional information for patients is available on FDA's Heater-Cooler Devices "Information for Patients" webpage.  FDA Activities:On December 29, 2015, the FDA issued a Warning Letter to LivaNova PLC (formerly Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH) for its Stӧckert 3T Heater-Cooler System after inspections conducted at facilities in Munchen, Germany and Arvada, Colorado revealed significant issues, including quality system and premarket clearance violations. Given the serious nature of the violations, the 3T devices manufactured by the Munchen facility are subject to import alert. This restricts the availability of the 3T devices to only those facilities that determine use of the device is medically necessary.Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH initiated an ongoing corrective action for the 3T in July 2015, and has included updates to instructions for use with new cleaning instructions and instructions for determining if a device is contaminated with biofilm or NTM. Further updates to this recall are expected and will be evaluated by the FDA for their ability to further reduce infection risk. Please see the FDA medical device recall database entry for more information regarding corrective actions by the manufacturer.In June 2016, the FDA convened the Circulatory System Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee meeting and received expert clinical opinion and recommendations for patient notification and patient follow-up procedures. The panel also discussed recommendations for sampling and monitoring of the 3T and other heater-cooler devices, including  regular visual monitoring of contamination within the water circuit, replacement of accessories (e.g. tubing) on a regular basis, and testing for water quality to assure adequate disinfection procedures are being performed. These recommendations are included in this Safety Communication.  The FDA continues to be actively engaged with the manufacturer, health care facilities and the CDC in evaluating risk and mitigation measures and will provide updates, as appropriate, as new information becomes available.Reporting Problems to the FDA:Device manufacturers and user facilities must comply with the applicable Medical Device Reporting (MDR) regulations. Health care personnel employed by facilities that are subject to the FDA's user facility reporting requirements should follow the reporting procedures established by their facilities.Prompt reporting of adverse events can help the FDA identify and better understand the risks associated with the use of medical devices. Health care providers should submit voluntary reports of infection transmission associated with heater-cooler devices or reports describing difficulty following the manufacturers' instructions for use to the agency via the Medical Device Reporting (MDR) process. If a health care provider suspects bacterial contamination of the heater-cooler device following use, we encourage the health care provider to file a voluntary report through MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting program.Additional Resources: FDA Communications on Heater-Cooler Devices Mycobacterium chimaera Infections Associated with Sorin Group Deutschland GmbH Stӧckert 3T Heater-Cooler System: FDA Safety Communication (June 1, 2016) - ARCHIVEDNontuberculous Mycobacterium Infections Associated with Heater-Cooler Devices: FDA Safety Communication (October 15, 2015)Heater-Cooler Informational WebpageFrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Perkins KM, Lawsin A, Hasan N, et al.

LivaNova Acquires Caisson Interventional, LLC | Business Wire
























































LivaNova Acquires Caisson Interventional, LLC






May 02, 2017 05:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--LivaNova PLC (NASDAQ:LIVN) (“LivaNova” or the “Company”), a 
      market-leading medical technology company, today announced it has 
      acquired the remaining outstanding interests in Caisson Interventional, 
      LLC (“Caisson”), in support of LivaNova’s strategic growth initiatives. 
      Based in Maple Grove, Minn., Caisson is a privately held clinical-stage 
      medical device company focused on the design, development and clinical 
      evaluation of a novel transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) 
      implant with a fully transvenous delivery system.
    


      “We recognized the potential of the talented Caisson team and its 
      technology several years ago. This team will now be the cornerstone for 
      our planned entry into the TMVR space, which has the potential to be an 
      important growth platform for us in the future,” said LivaNova’s CEO 
      Damien McDonald. “We intend to invest in the clinical studies, 
      regulatory approvals, product enhancements and other steps needed to 
      launch this mitral valve replacement system commercially. We expect it 
      will become a strategic complement to our heart valve portfolio for 
      heart team physicians, allowing us to offer patients the most advanced, 
      minimally invasive mitral valve replacement option.”
    

      Caisson’s device is unique, being the only TMVR product designed solely 
      for trans-septal approach and delivered through a single venous access. 
      The system is also designed for the implant to be fully retrieved 
      following functional evaluation, but prior to final release – a safety 
      feature important to physicians.
    

      “We created this percutaneous mitral valve replacement implant, 
      procedure and delivery system to offer a significant new therapy to 
      patients with severe mitral regurgitation,” said Caisson COO and 
      Co-founder Todd Mortier.
    

      Caisson initiated its clinical trials through the U.S. FDA Early 
      Feasibility Study program, and will add clinical sites in Europe and 
      Canada.
    

      “We look forward to joining LivaNova to combine our efforts in bringing 
      a superior technology to market,” added Caisson CEO and Co-founder C.J. 
      Schweich, Jr., M.D.
    

      LivaNova has been an investor in Caisson since 2012 and has agreed to 
      pay up to $72 million, net of $6 million of debt forgiveness, to acquire 
      the remaining 51 percent of the company. The first payment of $18 
      million was made at closing with the balance paid on a schedule driven 
      primarily by regulatory approvals and sales earn outs. As a result of 
      the acquisition, LivaNova expects to recognize a pre-tax non-cash gain 
      during the second quarter on the $15 million book value of its existing 
      investment in Caisson. The acquisition will be dilutive to earnings for 
      several years, but LivaNova fully anticipates this transaction will meet 
      all long-term financial metrics and internal standards. 2017 guidance 
      will be updated to include the estimated impact of the acquisition 
      during LivaNova’s first quarter earnings call tomorrow morning.
    

      The Caisson TMVR system is not approved for sale in any country.

      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of Section 27A of the United States Securities Act of 1933, as 
      amended, and Section 21E of the United States Securities Exchange Act of 
      1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements are not historical facts 
      but are based on certain assumptions of management and describe the 
      Company’s future plans, strategies and expectations. Forward-looking 
      statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking 
      terminology, including, but not limited to, "may," “could,” “seek,” 
      “guidance,” “predict,” “potential,” “likely,” "believe," "will," 
      "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "intend," "forecast," or 
      variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of 
      these terms or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained 
      in this press release are based on information presently available to 
      LivaNova and assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable, but 
      are inherently uncertain. As a result, the Company’s actual results, 
      performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed 
      or implied by these forward-looking statements, which are not guarantees 
      of future performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties 
      and other factors that are, in some cases, beyond the Company’s control. 
      Investors are cautioned that all such statements involve risks and 
      uncertainties, including without limitation, statements concerning entry 
      into the TMVR space, developing Caisson as an important growth platform, 
      investing in the clinical studies, regulatory approvals, product 
      enhancements and other steps needed to launch this mitral valve 
      replacement system commercially, developing Caisson as a strategic 
      addition to the Company’s heart valve portfolio, offering patients the 
      most advanced, minimally invasive mitral valve replacement option, 
      offering a significant new therapy to patients with severe mitral 
      regurgitation, adding clinical study sites for Caisson’s TMVR device in 
      Europe and Canada, bringing a superior technology to market, recognizing 
      a pre-tax non-cash gain during the second quarter on the $15 million 
      book value of its existing investment in Caisson, and anticipating that 
      this transaction will meet all long-term financial metrics and internal 
      standards. Important factors that may cause actual results to differ 
      include, but are not limited to: (i) risks that the legacy businesses of 
      Cyberonics, Inc. and Sorin S.p.A. (together, the “combined companies”) 
      will not be integrated successfully or that the combined companies will 
      not realize estimated cost savings, value of certain tax assets, 
      synergies and growth, or that such benefits may take longer to realize 
      than expected; (ii) the inability of LivaNova to meet expectations 
      regarding the timing, completion and accounting of tax treatments; (iii) 
      risks relating to unanticipated costs of integration, including 
      operating costs, customer loss or business disruption being greater than 
      expected; (iv) organizational and governance structure; (v) reductions 
      in customer spending, a slowdown in customer payments and changes in 
      customer demand for products and services; (vi) unanticipated changes 
      relating to competitive factors in the industries in which LivaNova 
      operates; (vii) the ability to hire and retain key personnel; (viii) the 
      ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers in the 
      manner anticipated; (ix) the reliance on and integration of information 
      technology systems; (x) changes in legislation or governmental 
      regulations affecting LivaNova; (xi) international, national or local 
      economic, social or political conditions that could adversely affect 
      LivaNova, its partners or its customers; (xii) conditions in the credit 
      markets; (xiii) business and other financial risks inherent to the 
      industries in which LivaNova operates; (xiv) risks associated with 
      assumptions made in connection with critical accounting estimates and 
      legal proceedings; (xv) LivaNova’s international operations, which are 
      subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and foreign exchange 
      controls; (xvi) and the potential of international unrest, economic 
      downturn or effects of currencies, tax assessments, tax adjustments, 
      anticipated tax rates, raw material costs or availability, benefit or 
      retirement plan costs, or other regulatory compliance costs. The 
      foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive. You should carefully 
      consider the foregoing factors and the other risks and uncertainties 
      that affect the Company’s business, including those described in the 
      “Risk Factors” section of Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports 
      on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, the Registration Statement on 
      Form S-4 and other documents filed from time to time with the United 
      States Securities and Exchange Commission by LivaNova. LivaNova does not 
      give any assurance (1) that LivaNova will achieve its expectations, or 
      (2) concerning any result or the timing thereof, in each case, with 
      respect to any regulatory action, administrative proceedings, government 
      investigations, litigation, warning letters, consent decree, cost 
      reductions, business strategies, earnings or revenue trends or future 
      financial results.
    

      All information in this press release is as of the date of its release. 
      The Company does not undertake or assume any obligation to update 
      publicly any of the forward-looking statements in this press release to 
      reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in 
      assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking 
      statements, except to the extent required by applicable law. If we 
      update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be 
      drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or 
      other forward-looking statements. We caution you not to place undue 
      reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are made only as of
