Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

            Bringing you the best deals from 
            the stores that you know and love
        



What is Stuccu?

                Stuccu is a website that works together with different sellers so you can buy products at low prices. 
                Our vision is to make Stuccu your first and only stop when it comes to online shopping. 
            

                And if we can make it fun for you, all the better.

                *

                longer need to search through dozens of websites.

About LaparoscopyHome  |  Resources  |  About LaparoscopyCommon Questions About Laparoscopy
Wendy Winer, R.N., B.S.N., CNOR
 
What is minimally invasive surgery?
Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is surgery done with either no incisions or very small incisions. This surgery may require no anesthetic, IV conscious sedation or general anesthesia. These surgeries may be performed in a qualified doctor’s office, surgery center with 23-hour stay capability or a hospital. These things will all vary with the surgeon’s preferences, training and what the best procedure is for the patient.
What is laparoscopy?
Laparoscopy is one type of minimally invasive surgery. It is commonly referred to as:

Keyhole surgery
Band-aid Surgery
Pinhole Surgery
Endoscopy

Laparoscopy involves small incisions and is most commonly done under general anesthesia at a surgery center or hospital. Patients typically go home the same day or the following morning unless the procedure requires more involved or advanced laparoscopic surgery, possibly in colon surgery, for instance, and in some urogynecologic procedures.
What are the advantages of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery?

Reduced blood loss during and after surgery, therefore, reducing the chance of a blood transfusion
Reduced adhesions or scar tissue postoperatively
Smaller and fewer incisions
Less pain postoperatively, therefore, less pain medication needed postop
Reduced hospital stay
Reduced exposure of internal organs (less exposure to more traumatic instrumentation during surgery and glove powder) and air that can create dryness and therefore possibly create adhesions
Reduced risk of infection

What common surgical procedures are performed laparoscopically?

Gynecological or procedures dealing with diseases and routine physical care of the reproductive system of women.

Exploratory Laparoscopy that includes evaluation of the pelvis and pelvic organs, i.e. ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, bladder and appendix.
Procedures in Gynecology that can be done laparoscopically include ovarian cystectomy, excision of an ovary (oophorectomy, also called ovariectomy), myomectomy, hysterectomy, lysis of adhesions, tubal reanastomosis, excision of endometriosis, oncology procedures and evaluation, pelvic floor reconstruction and bladder surgery.


General surgery and gastroenterological or procedures dealing with the structure, function, diseases and pathology of the stomach and intestines

These types of procedures can include gallbladder excision (cholecystectomy), appendix excision (appendectomy), spleen excision (splenectomy), hernia repair (herniorrhaphy), bariatric or procedures dealing with obesity (gastric bypass), and bowel or colon surgeries.


Urological or procedures dealing with urinary or urogenital organs.

Kidney removal (nephrectomy)


Many additional procedures may be done as well laparoscopically or endoscopically. There are continual advances almost daily of additional types of procedures that can be done through minimally invasive techniques in all areas of the body. There is a huge trend towards less invasive procedures that afford patients improved results with decreased morbidity.
