 Hope and a Future CD music Product Description

Hope and a Future album for sale by Wanda Perry Joseph was released Dec 14, 2004 on the Josephs Enterprise label. I've always been inspired by writers who were ordinary people who wrote about ordinary people who lived extraordinary lives. Hope and a Future buy CD music As a wife and mother of two, I write music to encourage people and families from all walks of life. Hope and a Future songs Vocalists and songwriters including Gladys Knight, Roberta Flack, Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, James Taylor, Leontine Price, Miles Davis, Bob Marley, and the Winans have influenced me. Hope and a Future album for sale I attended The Elma School of Performing Arts of Boston, MA, where I began a life long study of voice. Hope and a Future CD music My career as a songstress began in church. Hope and a Future buy CD music It was during the intense training at the Rolland Hayes Music Division of Madison Park High, where I met Leslie Jones and Margaret Furtado (aka Margo Thunder). Hope and a Future songs  Leslie Jones, Margaret Furtado, Wanda Perry. We became inseparable and realized that we had a special sound and began to invest in it. We practiced long and hard, and accepted endless encouragement from our loved ones, music teachers, and the City of Boston. This led us to develop as our own singing group, and we worked as background singers for Joe Frazier, Richard (Dimples) Field, and we recorded background for Patti Labelle's remake of "Shy" for Columbia Records. We shared the stage, studio and tours with a host of well-known artists and spent nine years together before RCA Records signed us as 9.9. Shortly before we inked our recording contract, I began to pray and seek God like never before, remembering what my grandmother always said about prayer and entering into a personal relationship with God, I reached a place in my life where I knew I needed God more than anything in the whole world and I made the commitment to Him, a commitment I never regretted at all. Our first album release "All of Me for All of You" bolted to the top of the charts in 1985 at number three on the Billboard Charts and number five in Europe. With the growing success of 9. 9, after completing the second album "Almost Perfect" and three videos, I made a difficult decision to move on.   ...See Full Description

Dear Paul and LaVern
I just learned of Perry’s death this evening. I don’t pretend to know the pain either  of  you are feeling. I have however known the indiscrible sarrow of losing a child.
I leave for CA in the morning and will not be available to attend services for Perry. Be assured, however, the two of you will be in my thoughts.
