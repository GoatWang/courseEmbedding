Fairmount Santrol Announces Signing of Long-Term Lease for Development of Permian Basin Sand Facility in Texas




















July 24, 2017 06:00 ET

 | Source: Fairmount Santrol






40-year lease for approximately 165 million tons of fine-grade reserves Construction of mining facility expected to be complete by second-quarter 2018 with annual production capacity of approximately 3 million tonsTotal leasehold interest payments and capital expenditures, estimated at $100 million to $110 million, expected to be funded with cashReserves located near Kermit, Texas, with access to the Delaware and Midland basins; complement Fairmount Santrol’s broad product portfolioCompany re-opens its Shakopee, Minnesota, Northern White sand mine due to increased customer demandFinalizing customer commitments for the majority of sand production from both the Kermit and Shakopee facilitiesCompany has also prepaid $50 million of term debt at end of second-quarter 2017 CHESTERLAND, Ohio, July  24, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Fairmount Santrol (NYSE:FMSA), a leading provider of high-performance sand and sand-based product solutions, today announced it has entered into a definitive 40-year lease agreement for approximately 3,250 acres of sand reserves located in Winkler County, Texas, in the Permian basin near Kermit. The reserves contain approximately 165 million tons of fine-grade 40/70 and 100 mesh sand. The Company intends to build a mine and processing facility on the leased land with approximately 3 million tons of proppant sand production annually. Over the past several months, the Company has ordered equipment and started to prepare the property for construction, which should accelerate the process and support the Company’s plan for sand production by the beginning of the second quarter of 2018.   Total leasehold interest payments and capital expenditures are estimated at $100 million to $110 million over the next 12 months.  The Company expects to fund this investment through a combination of cash on hand and cash flow generated from operations. An average royalty of less than $3 per ton, which includes water rights, will also be paid over the term of the lease on sand sold from the Kermit facility, with no minimum annual royalty. “The unique characteristics of this property, which include contiguous reserves of fine mesh sand, water availability and prime access to existing roads, make this an excellent opportunity for Fairmount Santrol to expand our broad product offering by providing a low-cost, in-basin solution to meet the changing requests from some of our customers,” said Jenniffer Deckard, President and Chief Executive Officer. “By leasing the reserves instead of an outright purchase, we will enhance our net return on investment and ensure greater financial flexibility. The ability to expand our capacity to meet growing market demand, while continuing the progress in strengthening our capital structure, creates value for our customers, shareholders and other stakeholders.” In addition, on June 30, 2017, Fairmount Santrol prepaid $50 million of term loans outstanding under its existing credit agreement. The prepayment was made utilizing existing cash on hand. The $50 million term loan prepayment will reduce annual interest expense by approximately $2 million. Further, due to increased customer demand, Fairmount Santrol has proceeded to reopen its Shakopee, Minnesota, mine and sand processing plant, which are located on the Union Pacific railroad. Once fully ramped up, the facility will have annual capacity of approximately 700,000 tons. The Company expects that the plant will be operational by the end of the third quarter of 2017.  For both the Kermit and Shakopee facilities, the Company is in the process of finalizing customer commitments for the majority of the tons that will be mined and processed. The Company also expects to receive prepayments from certain customers who sign long-term volume contracts to secure tonnage.  Fairmount Santrol is currently in a quiet period. The Company has provided a presentation related to the Kermit transaction on its website and looks forward to providing additional detail during its second-quarter earnings conference call that will be held on August 3, 2017, at 10:00 am Eastern Time. About Fairmount Santrol Fairmount Santrol is a leading provider of high-performance sand and sand-based product solutions used by oil and gas exploration and production companies to enhance the productivity of their wells.

What are analysts saying about NCI stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NCI stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NCI, Inc. is a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to U.S. federal government agencies. NCI's award-winning expertise encompasses areas critical to its customers' mission objectives including enterprise systems management, information assurance, network engineering, and systems development and integration.   " (5/13/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "NCIT offers an attractive risk/reward profile as its peer-low valuation (5.9x EV/EBITDA)." (4/10/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We take a neutral perspective on NCI shares for the time being, although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government IT landscape. CEO Paul Dillahay was appointed in October 2016, and we believe he is taking steps to increase NCI’s ability to capture new business. Given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate, the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable. That being said, we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the PEO Soldier contract that we estimate accounted for 16% of revenue in 2016—and there may be a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller. The company does have significant capabilities in agile software development, and we believe management’s approach is inspired; there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future, but for the time being, we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable."

Consensus Ratings for NCI (NASDAQ:NCIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $18.33 (8.10% downside)
