                Core Values

            






CNX Coal Resources operates based on three core values and two strategic priorities: Safety, Compliance, Continuous Improvement, Production, and Cost. Our core values are the foundation of the company's identity and are the basis for how we manage and conduct our business activities.
The evolution of CNX Coal Resources’ core values began in 2006 with a third-party survey of employees. A senior management team convened in March 2007 to review the results, and the message was sobering: the company needed a revolutionary change in its safety culture. This launched the decoupling of safety functions from compliance functions. Safety must trump everything, and our Absolute ZERO program became our standard. Four initiatives were launched that revolutionized the safety performance and culture at CNX Coal Resources.
These initiatives entailed a world-class training program, incentives, and rewards to recognize safe conduct, the decoupling of safety from compliance, and a team was formed to eliminate unsafe acts. These initiatives are living progressions of continuous improvement.
CNX Coal Resources is not content with just being in compliance. Our desire to be world class drives us to identify policies and strategies to further our performance beyond compliance standards. CNX Coal Resources is increasing its focus on environmental compliance to further improve our operations, and we are increasing our employee awareness through enhanced training, and communication, proactively identifying best-in-class processes and methods in our operations, and improving our transparency with stakeholders through reporting of our annual performance. Best-in-class performance that demonstrates our core values will directly translate to strong operations and financial results.




 CNXC Facts

Facility
  The complex is larger than the island of Manhattan. It is the largest underground coal mining operation in North America.

Results
  Dual-batch train loadout facility that operates 24/7 and loads up to 9,000 tons of coal per hour and 10 unit trains per day.

CNX Coal Resources LP (CNXC  -  Free Report)	 will report second-quarter 2017 financial results after the closing bell on Jul 31. Last quarter, the company reported negative earnings surprise of 9.09%.    Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderCNX Coal Resources is well positioned to benefit from the supply challenges resulting out of Australian export disturbances in the second quarter. CNX Coal Resources’ capitalization efforts to capture the broad market and continued cost control measures are likely to benefit the margins. With the support of domestic customers, it is well positioned to ship coal and increase overall shipment volumes.On the contracting front, CNXC’s marketing team worked on adding strategic customers as commodity markets continue to evolve. The company was able to raise its share in 15 coal plants from 12% in 2011 to 31% in 2016 and we expect these initiatives will further increase CNX Coal Resources’ share in these coal plants. In addition, President Trump’s decision to repeal the Clean Power Plan and walk out of Paris Agreement will help the coal producers by creating fresh demand for thermal coal.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that CNX Coal Resources is likely to beat estimates this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: CNX Coal Resources’ Earnings ESP is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 51 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CNX Coal Resources’ Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.CNX Coal Resources LP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  CNX Coal Resources LP Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | CNX Coal Resources LP QuoteWe caution against stocks with a Zack Rank #4 or #5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderIn absence of companies from the industry, investors can consider these stocks from the oil & energy sector, which have the right combination to beat estimates beat this quarter.TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +7.84% and a Zacks Rank #1. It is slated to report first-quarter results on Jul 28. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Global Partners LP (GLP  -  Free Report)	 has an Earnings ESP of +60% and a Zacks Rank #1.

CNX Coal Resources LP







Separating CONSOL’s Businesses – Pulling Value Forward And Providing Greater Transparency
On July 1, 2015, CNX Coal Resources LP (NYSE: CNXC) was spun out of CONSOL Energy in order to manage the operational and administrative functions of the company’s best-in-class coal assets. This was a critical step in establishing CONSOL Energy as a pure play natural gas exploration and production company.
The Bailey Mine Complex located in Greene and Washington counties, Pennsylvania, is the largest underground coal mine complex in North America. Consisting of the Bailey, Enlow Fork and Harvey mines, and a central preparation plant, it is also among the safest and most productive complexes in the world.

PITTSBURGH, Dec. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- CNX Coal Resources LP (NYSE:    CNXC) today announced,  in conjunction with its participation in CONSOL Energy Inc.'s (NYSE:    CNX) Analyst and Investor Day event today in Pittsburgh, PA, that it is reaffirming full-year 2016 guidance and providing its initial 2017 guidance.
Guidance and Outlook






 Guidance 

 2016 
 2017 


 Coal sales 
 million tons 
 5.90-6.10 
 6.25-6.75 


 Adjusted EBITDA1 
 $ million 
 $74-$82 
 $90-$110 


 Maintenance capital expenditures 
 $ million 
 $15-$19 
 $30-$36 





Sales volume is expected to improve in 2017, driven by the broader improvement in domestic and international coal markets. Based on the midpoint of our 2017 sales guidance range, approximately 94% of our coal is sold. We are maintaining exposure to further recovery in coal prices in 2017 through (a) 6% unsold position, (b) 5-10% unpriced/collared position and (c) 15-20% of our coal pricing linked to power prices (netback contracts). 
Based on our current expectations of 5-10% improvement in average revenue per ton and flat to low single digit increase in cost of coal sold compared to 2016, we are expecting 2017 EBITDA to be in the $90-$110 million range. Assuming no incremental dropdown transactions, this increase in EBITDA compared to 2016 levels will allow us to improve our leverage ratio, as defined by net debt/EBITDA, to the 1.8-2.2x range by the end of 2017. 
After reducing and deferring some capital spending in 2016, we expect maintenance capital expenditures to normalize in the approximately $5 per ton range for 2017 and beyond. Specifically for 2017, based on our initial estimates, maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be in the $30-36 million range. 
For 2018, we currently expect our sales volume to be in the 6.25-6.75 million ton range. Based on the midpoint of our 2018 sales guidance range, approximately 60% of our coal is sold. 

Analyst and Investor Day Jimmy Brock, Chief Executive Officer and Lori Ritter, Chief Financial and Accounting Officer of CNX Coal Resources GP LLC, along with certain other members of our management team will participate today in an Analyst and Investor Day event hosted by CONSOL Energy Inc. The management team will provide an overview of the Pennsylvania mining complex, discuss the business outlook and take questions from the analyst and investor community during a breakout session. 
A live audio webcast of the Analyst and Investor Day will begin today at 8.30 am ET and can be accessed by visiting the "Events and Webcasts" section of "Investors" tab of the company's website at www.cnxlp.com. The replay of the webcast will be available on the company's website for approximately 30 days. Additionally, a slide deck will be posted to the website to coincide with the onset of the meeting.

Cautionary Statements Various statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws including Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: generation of sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of minimum quarterly distributions; changes in coal prices or the costs of mining or transporting coal; uncertainty in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves and replacement of reserves; our ability to develop our existing coal reserves and successfully execute our mining plans; changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and globally; competitive conditions within the coal industry; changes in the consumption patterns of coal-fired power plants and steelmakers and other factors affecting the demand for coal by coal-fired power plants and steelmakers; the availability and price of coal to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels; competition from the same and alternative energy sources; energy efficiency and technology trends; our ability to successfully implement our business plan; the price and availability of debt and equity financing; operating hazards and other risks incidental to coal mining; major equipment failures and difficulties in obtaining equipment, parts and raw materials; availability, reliability and costs of transporting coal; adverse or abnormal geologic conditions, which may be unforeseen; natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; interest rates; labor availability, relations and other workforce factors; defaults by our sponsor under our operating agreement and employee services agreement; changes in availability and cost of capital; changes in our tax status; delays in the receipt of, failure to receive or revocation of necessary governmental permits; defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests with respect to our properties; the effect of existing and future laws and government regulations, including the enforcement and interpretation of environmental laws thereof; the effect of new or expanded greenhouse gas regulations; the effects of litigation; and other factors discussed in our 2015 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors," as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
(1)  CNX Coal Resources LP is unable to provide a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of certain income statement items.

PITTSBURGH, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- CNX Coal Resources LP (NYSE:    CNXC) today reported financial and operating results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. 
First Quarter 2017 Results


Highlights of the CNXC first quarter 2017 results include:

Cash distribution of $0.5125 per limited partner unit for the first quarter 
Net income of $14.1 million  
Adjusted EBITDA1 improves 70% to $27.9 million, compared to the year-ago period 
Distribution coverage ratio1 of 1.2x 
Leverage ratio improves to 2.15x compared to 2.48x on December 31, 2016 
Coal sales improve 29% to 1.7 million tons, compared to the year-ago period 
Average revenue per ton increases by 9%, compared to the year-ago period 
2017 Adjusted EBITDA2 guidance increases to $95-$115M

Management Comments
"Despite abnormally soft winter heating demand, the CNXC team delivered very strong operational and financial results during the first quarter of 2017. We were able to achieve near-record sales and production volumes, higher revenue per ton, and solid cost performance." said Jimmy Brock, Chief Executive Officer of CNX Coal Resources GP LLC (the "General Partner"). "The results also reflect the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth, strong coverage ratio, and continued reduction in indebtedness, since we completed the acquisition of additional interest in the Pennsylvania mining complex (PAMC) in the third quarter of 2016. I am also pleased to announce that the complex is exceeding the management team's expectations for incremental earnings contribution since the acquisition."
"On the safety front, our central preparation plant continued its excellent performance by working another quarter without an exception. This achievement marks the eighth consecutive exception-free quarter for the plant. The mining operations were also able to improve their safety performance by reducing their number of exceptions by 40% compared to the same period last year. Safety is our top value and we continue to seek further improvement."
Sales & Marketing
In spite of another mild winter, our coal sales improved substantially during the first quarter compared to the year-ago period, as higher natural gas prices and more normal coal inventory levels supported improved demand from our domestic power plant customers. Furthermore, tighter supply/demand fundamentals in the international coal markets also led to increased volumes and pricing for our crossover metallurgical and thermal coal exports.
During the first quarter, sales volumes increased in all three of our primary market areas - domestic thermal, export thermal, and export crossover metallurgical - compared to the year-ago period. Specifically, we posted near-record sales of 1.7 million tons in the first quarter vs. 1.3 million tons in the year-ago period. On the domestic front, Henry Hub spot natural gas prices averaged $3.02/mmBtu for the first quarter, up 51% from the average of $1.99/mmBtu in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, U.S. coal-fired power plant inventories stood at 164 million tons at the beginning of 2017, down 16% from 196 million tons at the beginning of 2016.  These factors helped to support solid first quarter shipments of PAMC coal to our domestic thermal coal customers, which were up by about 270 thousand tons year-over-year.  On the export front, market conditions were much-improved in the first quarter compared to the year-ago period, with the global coking coal benchmark up by about 250% and the API2 index (for coal delivered into Europe) up by more than 70%. This stronger export pricing drove an increase in our overall revenue per ton, which reached $46.80 in the first quarter, compared to $42.99 for the year-ago period.
The first quarter of 2017 was the second-warmest on record for the lower 48 states.  This exerted downward pressure on power prices throughout the quarter, which led to a slowdown in domestic customer shipments and contracting activity during the latter part of the quarter.  However, our marketing team continues to work with customers to stay on pace and take advantage of higher natural gas prices that have sustained into the shoulder period.  During the first quarter, CNXC was successful in signing an annual contract with a new customer as the end-user looked for an alternative supplier to help transition away from Central Appalachian coal. In the international markets, we continue to ship volumes into the crossover metallurgical coal market, and we increased our first quarter crossover volume by 37% year-over-year.  Based on our updated coal sales guidance range, we are approximately 95% contracted for 2017 and 64% contracted for 2018. We believe our contracted position is well-balanced in hedging against market downside risk while allowing us to continue to build out the portfolio strategically and opportunistically as the market evolves.
Looking forward, there is a growing consensus that increasing natural gas exports and modestly increasing domestic demand will tighten the supply/demand balance and drive up natural gas prices, with EIA now projecting that the Henry Hub spot natural gas price will average $3.10/mmBtu in 2017 and grow to $3.45/mmBtu in 2018. Our coal-fired customer plants are expected to dispatch well at these prices. EIA now projects that electric power sector coal consumption will improve by 17 million tons in 2018 relative to 2016 levels as coal recaptures share from gas in the generation mix. Furthermore, EIA projects that year-end power plant coal inventories will remain below 150 million tons in both 2017 and 2018. In the more immediate term, Cyclone Debbie, which made landfall on March 28, 2017, has caused a substantial disruption in coal exports from Australia, with one of the country's key rail lines impaired for approximately one month and recently re-opened at reduced capacity.  We expect that this will help to support continued demand for our export products in the near-term, as international metallurgical coal spot prices have risen rapidly, and thermal coal demand could also see some benefit as more crossover tons move into the metallurgical market. We will continue to capitalize on our broad market reach and our low-cost, flexible operations to maximize margins as these market opportunities unfold.
Quarterly Distribution
During the first quarter, CNXC generated net cash provided by operating activities of $17.7 million and distributable cash flow1 of $14.9 million, yielding a distribution coverage ratio of 1.2x1. We note that our distribution coverage ratio calculation is based on the estimated maintenance capital expenditure of $9.0 million, while our actual cash maintenance capital expenditure for the first quarter was $2.0 million. Based on our current outlook for the coal markets and distributable cash flow generated during the quarter, the Board of Directors of the general partner, has elected to pay a cash distribution $0.5125 per unit to all limited partner unitholders and the holder of the general partner interest. The Board of Directors has also approved a full cash distribution of approximately $0.4678 per unit to the holders of the convertible Class A Preferred Units.  The distribution to all unitholders of the Partnership will be made on May 15, 2017 to such holders of record at the close of business on May 8, 2017.
Shelf Registration
On February 8, 2017, we filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Subsequently, the shelf became effective and allows CNX Coal Resources the flexibility to offer and sell, from time to time over a three-year period, in one or more public offerings up to a total aggregate of up to $750 million of: (i) common units representing limited partnership interests of the Company; (ii) preferred units representing limited partnership interest of the Company; and (iii) debt securities.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any of the securities of CNX Coal Resources or its subsidiaries.
Operations Summary
Our operations team delivered strong production volumes for the quarter despite two longwall moves at Bailey mine and tough geological conditions at Enlow Fork mine. With domestic and international demand remaining strong for most of the quarter, our marketing team was successful in lining up a near-record shipment schedule. The operations team took advantage of this opportunity and mobilized additional shifts during the weekends to deliver a strong first quarter production. Looking forward, we expect geological conditions at Enlow Fork mine to improve in the second quarter as we have moved past some of the most difficult geology and production is expected to normalize.
We sold 1.7 million tons of coal during the first quarter of 2017 compared to 1.3 million tons in the year ago period. The average realized price improved by 9% compared to the year-ago period, as the pricing on export shipments improved significantly. Our total cost of coal sold increased to $58.4 million during the first quarter compared to $43.6 million in the year-ago quarter driven primarily by higher coal sales volume. The average cost of coal sold1 in the quarter increased 4.1% to $34.52 per ton, compared to $33.16 per ton in the year-ago quarter. The increase in unit costs was driven by mobilization of additional resources for the development of longwall panels, demanding geological conditions at Enlow Fork mine and increased equipment maintenance compared to year-ago quarter. Despite this increase in our average cost of coal sold, our average cash margin per ton sold1 improved by 10.9% compared to the year-ago quarter due to higher average realized price.

1 "Adjusted EBITDA", "Distribution coverage ratio", "Distributable cash flow", "Average cost of coal sold" and "Average cash margin per ton sold" are non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP net income under the caption "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"2 CNXC is unable to provide a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA guidance to Net Income, the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, due to the unknown effect, timing and potential significance of certain income statement items.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We evaluate our cost of coal sold on a cost per ton basis.  Our cost of coal sold per ton represents our costs of coal sold divided by the tons of coal we sell. We define cost of coal sold as operating and other production costs related to produced tons sold, along with changes in coal inventory, both in volumes and carrying values. The cost of coal sold per ton includes items such as direct operating costs, royalty and production taxes, direct administration, and depreciation, depletion and amortization costs.  Our costs exclude any indirect costs such as general and administrative costs and other costs not directly attributable to the production of coal.  The GAAP measure most directly comparable to cost of coal sold is total costs.
We define average cash margin per ton as average coal revenue per ton, net of average cost of coal sold per ton, less depreciation, depletion and amortization.
We define adjusted EBITDA as (i) net income (loss) before net interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, as adjusted for (ii) certain non-cash items, such as long-term incentive awards including phantom units under the CNX Coal Resources LP 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("Unit Based Compensation").  The GAAP measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA is net income.
We define distributable cash flow as (i) net income (loss) before net interest expense, depreciation, depletion and amortization, as adjusted for (ii) certain non-cash items, such as unit based compensation, less net cash interest paid and estimated maintenance capital expenditures, which is defined as those forecasted average capital expenditures required to maintain, over the long-term, the operating capacity of our capital assets.  These estimated capital expenditures do not reflect the actual cash capital incurred in the period presented.  Distributable cash flow will not reflect changes in working capital balances.  The GAAP measures most directly comparable to distributable cash flow are net income and net cash provided by operating activities.
The following table presents a reconciliation of cost of coal sold to total costs, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, on a historical basis for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).

Cautionary Statements
Various statements in this release, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention, may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws including Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. The forward-looking statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future production, revenues, income and capital spending. When we use the words "believe," "intend," "expect," "may," "should," "anticipate," "could," "estimate," "plan," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions, the statements which include those words are usually forward-looking statements. When we describe strategy that involves risks or uncertainties, we are making forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release; we disclaim any obligation to update these statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following: generation of sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of minimum quarterly distributions; changes in coal prices or the costs of mining or transporting coal; uncertainty in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves and replacement of reserves; our ability to develop our existing coal reserves and successfully execute our mining plans; changes in general economic conditions, both domestically and globally; competitive conditions within the coal industry; changes in the consumption patterns of coal-fired power plants and steelmakers and other factors affecting the demand for coal by coal-fired power plants and steelmakers; the availability and price of coal to the consumer compared to the price of alternative and competing fuels; competition from the same and alternative energy sources; energy efficiency and technology trends; our ability to successfully implement our business plan; the price and availability of debt and equity financing; operating hazards and other risks incidental to coal mining; major equipment failures and difficulties in obtaining equipment, parts and raw materials; availability, reliability and costs of transporting coal; adverse or abnormal geologic conditions, which may be unforeseen; natural disasters, weather-related delays, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; interest rates; labor availability, relations and other workforce factors; defaults by our sponsor under our operating agreement and employee services agreement; changes in availability and cost of capital; changes in our tax status; delays in the receipt of, failure to receive or revocation of necessary governmental permits; defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests with respect to our properties; the effect of existing and future laws and government regulations, including the enforcement and interpretation of environmental laws thereof; the effect of new or expanded greenhouse gas regulations; the effects of litigation; and other factors discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K under "Risk Factors," as updated by any subsequent Form 10-Qs, which are on file at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Its initial assets include around 20% undivided interest in and operational control over, CONSOL Energy's Pennsylvania mining complex, which consists of around three underground mines and related infrastructure that produce bituminous thermal coal that is sold primarily to electric utilities in the eastern United States. Its Pennsylvania mining complex, which includes the Bailey mine, the Enlow Fork mine and the Harvey mine, has coal reserves. The company mines its reserves from the Pittsburgh No. 8 Coal Seam, which is a contiguous formation of uniform, thermal coal.
