Orion Energy Systems Launches Game-Changing LED Retrofit Products - Orion Energy Systems, Inc (NYSEMKT:OESX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Orion Energy Systems Launches Game-Changing LED Retrofit ProductsApr.11.16 | About: Orion Energy (OESX) Arthur Frentzel Long only, long-term horizon, small-cap, special situationsSummaryNew products will likely revolutionize the fluorescent troffer retrofit to LED business.Termed the LDRE (LED Door Retrofit Edge) and LDRM (LED Door Retrofit Modular), the new items achieve a full fixture retrofit within a one-minute installation time.The new items have the potential to drive increased sales of the entire LED product offering of the company.The upbeat announcement April 1 was dismissed by the market, as OESX shares traded down a penny to $1.39.

 Orion ISON LED Retrofit Modular - LDRM (Source: Company website) Opportunity With approximately one billion fluorescent lighting troffers in the United States, the market for LED retrofitting is huge. Troffers (derived from the words trough and coffer) are lighting fixtures typically installed with drop ceilings in retail and office environments. The troffer lighting system has been termed the "workhorse" of retail and office environments. Fluorescent troffers typically are configured in 2' x 2' and 2' x 4' varieties, with one, two, or four fluorescent bulbs or tubes in each fixture. The older, and likely the most common, 2' x 4' troffer typically contains four 40 watt fluorescent bulbs consuming 160 watts of electricity. Generally, first-generation LED lighting products did not offer optimum characteristics satisfying consumer preferences for light output and color temperature. Much has changed in the LED lighting field to offer products that offer good light output and color quality, as well as output and optical control, vastly outperforming fluorescent predecessors that have been around since the 1940s. With LED, end users have the opportunity to not only improve lighting features and reduce energy consumption, but further reduce consumption with dimming and control systems offered in second-generation products.
 Orion Energy Systems (NYSEMKT:OESX) has been designing and selling troffer lighting systems since 2013, when the company purchased Harris Lighting, a Jacksonville, Florida company that specialized in office/retail lighting. With the launch of the new product shown in the above picture, Orion is now in the second generation of LED retrofit products for the troffer space. The Orion ISON™ LDR® Troffer Retrofit Modular, termed the LRRM, is an "architectural" contour design with improved appearance and output. The unit consumes between 29 watts and 63 watts per fixture, depending on the light output version chosen. Depending on the model chosen, energy savings would range between 81.9% and 60.6% for an LED retrofit from a 160 watt fluorescent unit. To illustrate the market opportunity in the troffer retrofit space by assigning an arbitrary number of $100 per unit would yield a market value of about $100 billion just in the retrofit business. The U.S. Department of Energy estimated that, as of 2014, only about 1% of linear fluorescent lighting had been retrofitted to LED, evidencing the early stage of adoption in process. Orion Energy Systems has a 12-month revenue run rate of only $68 million, including all product segments for commercial, industrial, parking, and other applications. Industrial has remained Orion's strongest segment since its inception; however, LED troffers could significantly increase its market share in the commercial space. While the author has written a number of articles on OESX, the fundamental performance of the company arguably deserves a much higher price than the current range near $1.40, which may offer an impressive, outsized return in the coming months. The launch of the new LDRE and LDRM products in themselves could drive significantly improved results and stock price, as will be illustrated below. Innovation is key LED lighting has been around awhile. However, in the very early stage of development, both in product development and adoption, the dynamics are changing daily. New product introductions have exploded across all segments of bulbs, tubes, fixtures, sensors, control systems, and other components. Success in the business will be achieved by true innovators that develop advanced products which add value to end users, achieve differentiation, and build brand preference. With its recent product launch announcement, Orion continues to prove its ability to innovate with products otherwise unavailable in the market.
 New Orion products and why they matter In 2014, Orion launched a new LED troffer retrofit unit it called the LED Door Retrofit or LDR (installation pictured below). The product was innovative in that the original fluorescent components could be removed from the troffer, followed by inserting two brackets and placing the LED unit inside the frame. The unit originally used the existing lens style to complete the conversion to LED which was later eclipsed by new contour designs. The LDR earned a distinction as an award-winning product that laid the groundwork for further enhancements. The product installed and worked well, but with little improvement in aesthetic appearance. Since the introduction of the LDR, both new construction and retrofit LED troffer units on the market have transitioned to an improved contour design, which offers improvements in both performance and appearance (picture shown on title page). 

 Installing LDR (Source: Company presentation) A company announcement on April 1 previewed the launch of two new contour design LED troffer retrofit products that are termed "game changers" by the company in stating that the units can be installed in about one minute, in about the same time required to change the bulbs. The two new products are detailed below: 1) The new ISON LDR® Troffer Retrofit Modular (LDRM) unit offers a step-change in advanced features. As will be further evidenced below, there is nothing comparable to it on the market today. The LDRM offers the advantages of the LED conversion with the most up-to-date contour design, performance, and easy install within 1-2 minutes. While other units on the market claim easy-to-install features, no other product comes close to a one-minute install. Installing a few LED troffer retrofits units may not make much difference. However, when 5000 units are installed in an office complex setting, it is a big deal. Furthermore, the LDRM can be upgraded with a new light engine as technology advances, making the item "future-proof," as the company describes it. Complete information on the LDRM is provided on the company website here.
 Some of the key product features include:  Patented modular design assembled complete from the factory, powder-coated. 1-2 minute installation, with no tools required. Light engine can be upgraded as technology improves, without replacing the complete unit. Smart components that enable hundreds of factory or field-installed options available, including battery backup, dimming drivers, sensors, wireless connection, and mobile technologies, which enable connection to any IT system. 125,000 rated life, maintenance free, 10-year warranty.  A copy of a portion of the sell sheet for the ISON LDRM is pasted below, which illustrates the simple 5-step installation: 

 2) The new HARRIS LDR® Troffer Retrofit Edge (LDRE) modular unit has the lowest installed cost of any complete unit offered by the company. Detailed documentation of the product on the company website can be found here. The Harris version (pictured below) appears similar to the ISON unit, with contour, modular design. 

 Harris LED Retrofit Edge - LDRE (Source Company website) A key difference between the ISON and Harris versions is that the light engine in the ISON unit is upgradeable, while that in the Harris unit is not. However, the Harris unit offers the most economical alternative on an installed basis. The Harris LDRE offers a 100,000 rated life and a 5-year warranty. Both the LDRM and LDRE offer multiple choices in lumen output, ranging between 2000 and 8000 actual lumens and lumens per watt ranging between 103 and 126, as well as color temperature options.
 Sensors and controls Other key features of both the ISON and Harris products include optional controls and sensors, enabling connectivity with the internet and Big Data. Connected lighting systems are quickly becoming part of the overall IT system for organizations. Compared to fluorescent, LED lighting provides much greater control in dimming and other output features which are increasingly part of "smart" connected building systems. However, with the introduction of its latest suite of products, Orion has moved its product offering to the next level of control and connectivity. Instead of using its proprietary offerings, the company elected to partner with the best in class, Lutron Electronics and Enlightened Incorporated, for dimming driver options, controls, and sensors. Lutron and Enlightened are recognized leaders in their respective markets. The new partnerships, timed with the launch of the LDRM and LDRE, offer a compelling total product offering and opportunity as Orion enters fiscal 2017, which began on April 1. The LED lighting market landscape All of the largest lighting suppliers, like General Electric (NYSE:GE), Cooper Lighting-Eaton (NYSE:ETN), Philips (NYSE:PHG), Acuity (NYSE:AYI), and others, offer LED troffer retrofit kits that are installed as components, with claimed installation times running from 5 to 30 minutes. However, none offer a product comparable to the Orion LDRM and LDRE in terms of installation. Likely the closest alternative, Philips supplies a modular unit it calls the EvoKit, which is a 6-component contour unit. According to the company, the EvoKit can be installed by an experienced installer in about five to ten minutes. A Philips installation video is linked here. An online search for pricing of a 2' x 4' Philips EvoKit resulted in retail prices ranging from about $150 to $220, not including shipping. While Orion products are sold in B2B transactions, which do not lend well to retail comparisons, the company has indicated the prices of the LDRE are "in line" with that of the Philips EvoKit. However, since the EvoKit must be assembled by installers on site, requiring tools and a great deal more time, the LDRE offers significant advantage.
 It's all about the troffer In most of its history, the troffer has offered a suitable lighting source at an economically viable cost, but with lackluster appearance. The new modular LED troffers enable an improved appearance, in addition to lower energy consumption. The new Orion LDRE and LDRM, which can be installed in about the same time it would take to change the bulbs, should be a game changer. Most businesses have an assortment of luminary fixtures, which may include office, retail, factory, distribution, exterior, parking, and egress signage, but if they have an office, they likely have troffers. Due to the sheer numbers of troffers and the fact that troffers are present in most businesses, a game-changing product should help drive sales across the Orion product line-up, which includes products for commercial, industrial, retail, government, education, healthcare, transportation, and other categories. The foregoing opens up an entire market for Orion that did not exist just a few years ago. In past years, Orion's revenue has typically ramped up disproportionately in the 3rd and 4th fiscal quarters ending in December and March, due to year-end budget spends by industrial clients. Before the company purchased Harris Lighting in 2013, it was not in the troffers business. Many customers with a heavy concentration in troffers, like schools and other institutional customers, tend to make facility changes and upgrades during summer months. Other entities like government and healthcare organizations may update infrastructure at any time during the year. As a result, sales of troffers should result in a more evenly distributed and predictable revenue stream throughout the year. Since entering the troffers business, Orion management has provided lower gross margin guidance for the troffer segment, compared to high bay lighting products, which have been the company's mainstay. Lower gross margins for troffers have resulted from commodity-type products and intense competition in the space. During Q3, management stated that the margins on troffer retrofit products should increase after the launch of new products in calendar 2016. The LDRE and LDRM appear to be the new products mentioned and, accordingly, should drive margins higher. As a common tenet, innovation drives higher gross margins and value for end users. But beyond margins, the advanced, competitively priced LDRM and LDRE should offer a boost in pulling the entire Orion product line through the channel.
 Near-term prospects Since Orion's Q3 reported results (December 31) were a huge disappointment to investors, with a 36% drop in YOY revenue, it remains uncertain what Q4 and full-year fiscal 2016 (ended March 31) will look like. While the company booked revenue of $19.4 million in Q4 2015, management has indicated that the majority of a $7.4 Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) PO would book in Q4, albeit with a lower gross margin. During the Q3 earnings conference call, management indicated softness in the business, confirmed by a deteriorating PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) figure below 50, which signifies contraction in business procurement. Recently, the index has begun to trend up, as evidenced in the latest March report. However, due to reported weakness in Q3 results and muted GDP growth, it appears unlikely that the business could "turn on a dime" to produce outsized Q4 results. As the LED transition gains traction and the business environment improves, however, Orion should begin to gain market share and ramp up volume, due in a large part to product innovation advantages. LED adoption is underway and has just begun. The largest LED lighting transaction to date was recently reported by Current, a division of General Electric, to outfit 5000 J.P. Morgan branches with LED lighting fixtures. The dollar value of the deal was not disclosed, however, it was reported as a record-setting LED lighting transaction. GE does not appear to have product advantage over Orion in the LED retrofit fixtures space. Likely more significant, GE has maintained a business relationship with J.P. Morgan going back to 1892, when the latter put together the merger deal that formed General Electric. It is logical that it would choose General Electric instead of a less-recognized name. Strategic repositioning Orion announced on April 5th that it had entered into an agreement to sell its fully owned 266,000-square feet manufacturing, distribution, and office property located on 10 acres in Manitowoc Wisconsin for $2.5 million in cash. The company owns an additional 20 acres adjacent to the site. With $20 million in cash and a strong balance sheet at the end of Q3, it is apparent that Orion is not cash-strapped, and it intends to invest in R&D and product development in the rapidly evolving LED lighting business. Based on what it has done so far in new product launches, with relatively small expenditures on R&D and product development, the decision appears to be well grounded. Moving away from a vertically integrated model, the company is transitioning into a leaner operation with greater return on investment, in order to increase shareholder value. With increasing demands for advanced technology in the space, it becomes apparent that new products require a higher degree of complexity in a greatly enhanced array of features demanded in the space, which will require more outsourcing. Accordingly, the company will lease back 200,000 square feet of the facility, which will have the effect of right-sizing the business and lowering operating costs. The strategic repositioning represents another stage in a process that has been going on for several years in shedding assets (including other property and a corporate jet) to become an asset-light, technology-enhanced business.
 The stock today Trading near $1.40, OESX appears to be bottoming in a long descent down from a multi-year high near $7.00 (January 2014) to a low of $1.18 (February 12, 2016). With a strong balance sheet and compelling line-up of products in the fast-growing LED business, it is hard to imagine the stock going much lower. It could happen, but appears doubtful. In any event, it will likely take improving, strong reported results to move the stock much higher after a long string of earnings disappointments over the past few years. The company completed its fiscal Q4 March 31, and is now operating in fiscal 2017. With a multi-year turnaround in the rear-view mirror and strong fundamentals, it appears likely that the stock will establish an upward trend going forward. Conclusion The LED lighting industry is changing at breakneck speed, and it appears that Orion Energy Systems is leading innovation in the LED retrofit space. Due to a challenging turnaround situation, the company has a history of muted revenue and quarterly losses as its legacy business receded with the prospect of LED adoption. Repeated disappointments in reported revenue and earnings have driven the stock down to near-penny stock status in the range of $1.40 per share. But unlike most penny stocks, Orion has a real business poised for a leap forward. The launch of the LDRM and LDRE will take a product conceived in the 1940s (the troffer) and propel it into the high-tech world of today. A thorough review of Orion, including its product suite, financials, management decisions, business organization, and client roster, reveals a company worth much more than the market currently assigns it. While quarterly losses have been ongoing for quite a while, the company experienced a 57% YOY improvement for the 12 months end December 31, 2015. The author remains upbeat on the company after choosing OESX for an SA contest best pick of 2016, and increasing long holdings in the shares. The shares appear to have bottomed and to be in the early stages of an uptrend. We shall see. Microcap investing is risky and sometimes subject to big disappointments. However, to those who investigate and remain firm in their convictions, ample reward should be the end result.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

                        This business has no complaints filed
                    









Composite Score:





                        Orion Energy Systems, Inc. has received 0 out of 5 stars based on 0 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Orion Energy Systems: Clear Vision For Big Growth In LED Lighting - Orion Energy Systems, Inc (NYSEMKT:OESX) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Orion Energy Systems: Clear Vision For Big Growth In LED LightingNov.21.16 | About: Orion Energy (OESX) Arthur Frentzel Long only, long-term horizon, small-cap, special situationsSummaryA recent Q2 quarterly report exceeded expectations with improved revenue, earnings, margin expansion and positive cash flow.Management has delivered on a total remake of the business, now visible in results.New products, new customers, new markets and new channel partners enable a potential steep trajectory of future revenue and profit growth.Projected growth of LED lighting and “smart” building technologies provide a tailwind for the company in a secular trend that will continue for decades.Innovation and a constant stream of new products are driving the company to become a key leader in the LED lighting industry.Anyone familiar with the history of Orion Energy Systems (NYSEMKT:OESX) has known the company to be a huge disappointment to investors since its IPO in 2007, as the chart below illustrates. 

I have written previous SA articles on OESX beginning in 2014 and have been following the company since 2013. An obvious question that can be raised is an assumption of falling in love with a stock and holding on for an extended period of underperformance. Most weak holders abandoned OESX as the stock was pushed down under $1.20 in a long, wrenching process. Such a process tries the patience of investors and requires a greater and greater level of knowledge, understanding and patience to remain in a stock. The purpose of the current article will be to consider some of the reasons for staying with and doubling down on Orion. Founded in 1996 and located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, OESX originally supplied retrofit lighting fixtures and controls which reduced energy consumption for its clients, mainly industrial entities. In the age before LED adoption, the company supplied florescent lighting fixtures and controls that offered superior performance to reduce energy consumption, booking revenue to clients that included about 180 Fortune 500 companies. By 2012, the company risked extinction as LED adoption began, which changed the industry in multiple ways. With LED, lighting could be designed in an infinite variety of configurations (instead of linear/fixed configurations common in florescent) which began an explosion of LED product development and offerings.
 Due to its declining prospects, the OESX board, near the end of 2012, made a decision to implement sweeping changes and a major restructuring of the business, which included a demotion of the former CEO/founder as well as other management changes. The management changes ultimately resulted in the departure of the former CEO as well as extreme employee turnover throughout the ranks. In addition to management changes, the entire business structure was totally inept to compete in the LED space. At the time, the company also maintained a division that fabricated structures that were supplied in solar energy installations. The company had no LED product lines, with no in-house research, engineering or design capabilities. The company had built its business largely in the industrial space, with the majority of revenue focused on high-bay lighting. It sold its products either on a direct basis to national accounts or through contractors termed energy service companies (ESCOs). In summary, Orion was totally unprepared for the transition to LED which was beginning adoption. Ultimately, management faced challenges of exiting the legacy businesses, conceiving, designing and launching new LED products, sourcing LED raw materials, and a complete reset of its marketing/distribution system. The entire business had to be rebuilt to transition into LED. During the extended restructuring that lasted over three years, multiple charge-offs and write-downs were recorded as the legacy business was shed and facilities were repositioned for the future. When beginning to supply its initial LED lighting products, the company was forced to source LED components at unfavorable acquisition costs, starting from a zero base. All of the foregoing resulted is severe financial underperformance for over three years, which put the stock where it is today. Beginning in 2013, management set in place a strategic plan to restructure the business and transition to LED. In spite of the challenges discussed above, the company has executed to completion several key targets against its strategic plan, which are listed below:
 1. Implemented its plan to transition from florescent to LED lighting which resulted in LED lighting revenue of 81% of revenue reported in Q2. 2. Acquired Harris Lighting Company, which was a troffer lighting supplier in office and commercial markets, which expanded the market from industrial into office and retail, expanding its addressable market many-fold. 3. Set up an innovation hub in Chicago staffed with lighting/LED experts to bring design/engineering in-house and advance innovation. 4. Created and launched a full suite of LED lighting products and options. To view the Orion product line, a link to its summer 2016 catalog is given here (321 pages, takes time to open). 5. Achieved the highest lumens per watt available worldwide for its flagship ISON-class high-bay luminary at 214 LPW. 6. Expanded its distribution channel to include agency/lighting distributors, which expanded the company's addressable market to 75% of the business. 7. Navigated the business to improved financial metrics, with growing margin improvement and positive cash flow. 8. Positioned both the organization and assets for leaner operations and better financial performance. Although not yet showing up significantly in the numbers, the above accomplishments give evidence that management has the ability to execute, which should ultimately show up in financial performance. The company and stock today: Some current financial metrics for Orion are illustrated in the table below:   MktCap RevTTM GrossMgn Price/Sls Price/Bk RevQ/Q EPS YoY FCF YoY   $42MM $67MM 24.% .63 .98 19.1% 42.9% -$5.1 to +.4 MM                     (Source: Finviz.com and company reports, as of 11-11-16) As illustrated above, the market is currently ignoring the growth parameters and, further, the prospects for OESX in the high-growth LED lighting business. A price to sales ratio of .63 depicts a business that is in a state of decline, not growth. Gross margin is low at 24.4%. However, margins have continued to grow by quarter and reached 33% in Q2. Revenue and EPS have shown significant improvement as the company turned cash flow positive, which is further documented in the table below with quarterly numbers. The quarterly numbers reveal a company that has shown continual improvement, albeit with fits and starts. The numbers show a company that has reduced risk with increased cash and dwindling long-term debt. In addition to low debt, OESX had a current ratio of 2.6 at the end of Q2, maintaining a strong balance sheet.

During the back half of last year (2015-2016) revenues came in very light due to decreased business spending (confirmed by lower ISM indicators) at $16.8 million and $18.6 million for Q3 and Q4, respectively. The $18.6 million was slightly exceeded in Q2. Although performance has shown some deviation by quarter, it should be considered that Orion's business has mainly consisted of supplying capital equipment to industry, which can fluctuate significantly by quarter. As traction gains in commercial and retail, the company will diversify its revenue stream by industry and business cycle. Recent economic indicators that have been reported appear to indicate that the economy is picking up steam, which should be accompanied by improved business spending. Further, LED adoption has not gained large scale traction in industrial and commercial, which muted revenue gains in the immediate past. An acceleration of the economy, coupled with increased business spending, should move Orion to much higher revenue. Lastly, the company has significant product and service advantages that will enable it to meet the competition and, more likely, exceed it. No discussion of Orion would be complete without mention of its impressive customer base. It has done business with over 180 Fortune 500 companies with its legacy lighting products, which offers a runway to the LED lighting market. An illustration of some of its client list is given below. 


 (Source: Company presentation) While OESX stock has been in an extended downturn as noted in the long-term chart illustrated earlier, the chart below shows an impressive breakout since the beginning of November, and it appears the market is beginning to recognize the potential upside and excellent prospects. Still, at $1.81 a share, it has likely just begun. 

 (Courtesy: StockCharts.com) From November 2 to November 18, OESX rallied an impressive 54.7%, from $1.17 to $1.81. The rally paralleled a rally in the Russell 2000 (RUT) in the same time frame. However, the Russell recorded a gain of 13.2% from 1162.52 to 1315.64. The beginning outperformance of OESX could signal outperformance for an extended period as the stock moves from a very small base. Whether it continues depends on continued financial improvement and recognition by the market of its improving prospects. R&D and smart technology/smart buildings: Before the transition to LED, Orion maintained a strong position as a leader in lighting and energy management controls. Since retooling the company to LED occupied most of the resources of the company, development of controls took a back seat to the LED transition. On the Q2 earnings conference call CEO John Scribante addressed a question concerning potential new products for smart technology - smart building controls. In essence Mr. Scribante stated that the company, in most of its history since 2007, had been a leader in building controls and energy efficiency management. Due to the LED transition, the company has recently partnered with third-party sources to supply smart technology components. According to Mr. Scribante, the company intends to invest in smart technologies where it makes sense in the overall financial performance of the company, without spending millions to compete in an already overcrowded space.
 Near-term expectations: As the recent stock price and breakout seem to indicate, Orion should perform well as it completes the back half of the fiscal year ending March 31. Since Q3 and Q4 typically exceed first half revenue, and management continued guidance of revenue increases ranging from 10-20%, fiscal 2017 should end well. The back half will be further bolstered by a recent new contract award from Toyota to install Orion high-bay fixtures at an 8.1 million square feet facility in Kentucky which, according to management, will book 70% of its revenue in Q3-Q4. It must be further pointed out that management guided that the 33% gross margin achieved in Q2 will not be likely achieved in Q3-Q4 and that it expects gross margin to be in the range of 30% due to business/product mix. Management further stated that while margins can increase to the mid-30% range beyond Q3-Q4, some lumpiness in margins will likely occur as the business proceeds in a ramp up. Long-term expectations: As LED adoption continues to build momentum, especially in industrial and commercial applications, Orion revenue and profits will likely accelerate. With the company operating near breakeven, earnings should show significant gains beyond the level of meeting fixed costs, enabling a ramp-up in profits and the stock price. The company has exhibited an ability to execute significant changes in the business and, at the same time, control costs. There appears not to be a competitor operating in its specific market, retrofit LED lighting for industrial and commercial, that offers a comparable array of fixtures and performance. Once revenue and profits begin ramping, the stock price will likely track with a long upward trajectory beyond $1.81. The company has an enviable product lineup with product and service advantages beyond most of the competition. GE (NYSE:GE) and Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX), likely Orion's most notable competitors when it comes to bidding projects, possess financial resources much larger than Orion, but are lacking in focus notable with Orion. In addition, as Orion gains traction, it will surely gain attention from other big players in the market, which could position it as an acquisition target. With a current market cap near $50 million, it may already be on the radar screen of bigger operators. Cree (NASDAQ:CREE), which announced in July the sale of its Wolfspeed division for $850 million in cash, could be a likely suitor. At the time of the announcement, Cree management stated publicly that it will be in the market for complimentary acquisitions.
 As the LED lighting market continues to gain traction, there will be many beneficiaries like the companies previously mentioned. Orion stock, however, could be a huge beneficiary. Risks: Orion Energy Systems has experienced ongoing losses for multiple years, which could continue. The company competes in a market populated with much bigger players like GE, Flex, Phillips, Eaton (NYSE:EV), Osram (OTCPK:OSAGF), Cree and others. The company has limited resources by comparison. Its current lineup of product advantages could be upended by competitors with much deeper pockets to fund R&D and product development. Lastly, technological leaders in the smart building arena could develop superior lighting configurations and, coupled with a strong suite of smart technologies, secure an advantage. Conclusion: Orion Energy Systems appears to be well positioned to become a major player in the LED lighting market, with potential revenue and profit gains along the way. In addition, the company has expanded its addressable market many-fold to capture its share of LED revenue, which is expected to reach $94 billion by 2020, growing at an annual CAGR of 13% between 2016 and 2020. While it remains a tiny company in a universe of much larger players, OESX has the potential for outsized gains in appreciation, but with increased risk compared to large counterparts. Investors are encouraged to let risk tolerance be their guide.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
