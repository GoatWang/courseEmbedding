JNL� Variable Fund LLC






Please note that the changes apply to your variable annuity and/or variable life product(s).




In the section entitled, "Summary Overview of Each Fund" for the JNL/Mellon Capital S&P� SMid 60 Fund, please add the following:






�


Foreign securities risk � Investments in, or exposure to, foreign securities involve risks not typically associated with U.S. investments. These risks include, among others, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency values, possible imposition of foreign withholding or other taxes on income payable on the securities, as well as adverse political, social and economic developments, such as political upheaval, acts of terrorism, financial troubles, or natural disasters. Many foreign securities markets, especially those in emerging market countries, are less stable, smaller, less liquid, and less regulated than U.S. securities markets, and the costs of trading in those markets is often higher than in U.S. securities markets. There may also be less publicly-available information about issuers of foreign securities compared to issuers of U.S. securities. In addition, the economies of certain foreign markets may not compare favorably with
the economy of the United States with respect to issues such as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position.








In the section entitled, "Additional Information About Each Fund,"�in the sub-section "Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund," for the JNL/Mellon Capital S&P� SMid 60 Fund, please add the following:

In the section entitled, "Management of the JNL Variable Fund," subsection "Investment in Fund Shares," please delete the second paragraph in its entirety and replace with the following:


Purchases are effected at NAV next determined after the purchase order is received by JNAM as the Funds' transfer agent in proper form.� There is no sales charge.� Shares of the Funds are not available to the general public directly.




In the section entitled, "Management of the JNL Variable Fund," subsection "Redemption of Fund Shares," please delete the first paragraph in its entirety and replace with the following:


A Separate Account redeems shares of a Fund to make benefit or withdrawal payments under the terms of its Contracts.� Redemptions typically are processed on any day on which the Trust and the NYSE are open for business and are effected at net asset value next determined after the redemption order is received by JNAM, the Fund's transfer agent in proper form.

BACKGROUND

12.

In 1998, representatives of the JNL Defendants and First Trust commenced a
dialogue about
implementing into Jackson National Life Insurance’s variable
annuity products certain investment strategies used by First Trust Portfolios L.P in
its unit investment trusts.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 12 and therefore denies the allegations.

13. As a result of this dialogue, First Trust facilitated the implementation of five
successful
investment strategies in the variable annuity products of Jackson
National Life Insurance. First Trust worked with JNL Variable Fund to implement
variable annuity funds using these five investment strategies.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 13 and therefore denies the allegations.

14.

First Trust also worked with Jackson National Life Distributors and its sales staff to
educate them about techniques to effectively sell variable annuity products making
use of such investment strategies.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 14 and therefore denies the allegations.

15. As Sub-Advisor to JNL Variable Fund, First Trust managed the investment and

reinvestment of the assets of each of JNL Variable Fund’s variable annuity funds.

9136744

5

Case: 1:07-cv-03011 Document #: 15 Filed: 08/15/07 Page 6 of 13 PageID #:38

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 15 and therefore denies the allegations.

16.

In December 2003, JNL Variable Fund and Jackson National Asset terminated their
relationship with First Trust.
In First Trust’s place, JNL Variable Fund and
Jackson National Asset retained the firm of Curian Capital, LLC. The sub-advisory
relationship between JNL Variable Fund, Jackson National Asset, and Curian
Capital, LLC lasted approximately two months.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 16 and therefore denies the allegations.

17.

Subsequently, JNL Variable Fund and Jackson National Asset solicited requests for
proposals from numerous investment firms,
including First Trust and Mellon
Capital. Ultimately, Mellon Capital was selected as the new Sub-Advisor for JNL
Variable Fund.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital admits that

it was selected as Sub-Advisor for JNL

Variable Fund after submitting a request for proposal. Mellon lacks sufficient knowledge to

form a belief as to the truth of the remaining allegations in paragraph 17 and therefore denies the

allegations.

18.

First Trust developed other innovative strategies, not provided to JNL Variable
Fund or Jackson National Asset for use in variable annuity products, including a
method of selecting a portfolio of securities from a particular database of securities,
e.g., the NASDAQ 100 Index of stocks, or the 100 stocks identified in the Value
Line Investment Survey, for investment purposes.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 18 and therefore denies the allegations.

19. Without authorization from First Trust, JNL Variable Fund copied First Trust’s
security selection method for use in JNL Variable Fund’s JNL/Mellon Capital
Management NASDAQ® 15 Fund, JNL/Mellon Capital Management Value Line®
25 Fund, the JNL/Mellon Capital Management VIP Fund, JNL/Mellon Capital
Management JNL Optimized 5 Fund, as well as other investment portfolios. This
unauthorized use extends to a network of JNL Variable Fund-affiliated companies,
including Jackson National Life Insurance, Jackson National Life Distributors,
Jackson National Asset, JNL Investors Series, and Mellon Capital.

Case: 1:07-cv-03011 Document #: 15 Filed: 08/15/07 Page 7 of 13 PageID #:39

ANSWER: Mellon Capital lacks sufficient knowledge to form a belief as to the truth

of the allegations in paragraph 19 and therefore denies the allegations.

INFRINGEMENT OF U.S. PATENT NO. 7,206,760

20.

First Trust incorporates paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth herein.

ANSWER: Mellon Capital repeats, restates and incorporates its answers in entirety to

paragraphs 1 through 19 as its answer to paragraph 20.

21. On April 17, 2007, the United States Patent and Trademark Office duly and legally
issued U.S. Patent No. 7,206,760 (“the ’760 patent”) titled “Method of Selecting

allegations in paragraph 22 and therefore denies allegations.

the JNL Defendants and Mellon Capital made, used, sold, and/or offered for sale in
the United States variable annuity products in which a group of securities was
selected according to a method that infringed the ’760 patent, in violation of 35
U.S.C. § 271.

willful and deliberate infringement of the ’760 patent which justifies an increase in
damages to be assessed pursuant to 35 U.S.C. § 284 and further qualifies this action
as an exceptional case supporting an award of reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant
to 35 U.S.C. § 285.

which First Trust has alleged that Mellon Capital has infringed and continues to infringe, has

contributory infringement of one or more claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,206,760. Mellon Capital
