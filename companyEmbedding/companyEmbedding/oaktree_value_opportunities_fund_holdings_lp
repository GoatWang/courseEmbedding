Home/ About



About

Oaktree's mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct our business with the highest integrity.

Oaktree Capital Management is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies. The firm was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s in high yield bonds, convertible securities, distressed debt, real estate, control investments and listed equities. Today, Oaktree comprises over 900 employees in Los Angeles (headquarters), New York, Stamford, Houston, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Amsterdam*, Dublin*, Luxembourg*, Dubai, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai and Sydney. We have 34 portfolio managers with average experience of 23 years and over 780 years of combined investment experience.

The firm’s competitive advantages include its experienced team of investment professionals, a global platform and a unifying investment philosophy. This investment philosophy, which consists of six tenets - risk control, consistency, market inefficiency, specialization, bottom-up analysis and disavowal of market timing - is complemented by a set of core business principles that articulate Oaktree’s commitment to excellence in investing, commonality of interests with clients, a collaborative and cooperative culture, and a disciplined, opportunistic approach to the expansion of offerings.

As a result of consistent application of our philosophy and principles, Oaktree has earned a large and distinguished  clientele. Among Oaktree's global clients are 75 of the 100 largest U.S. pension plans, over 400 corporations around the world, over 350 endowments and foundations globally, 16 sovereign wealth funds and 38 of the 50 primary state retirement plans in the United States.

Our expertise investing across the capital structure has allowed us to cultivate a diversified mix of global investment strategies in six categories: distressed debt, corporate debt, control investing, convertible securities, real estate and listed equities. Importantly, the expansion of our strategies has been achieved primarily through “step-outs” into highly related fields, based on identifying markets that (a) we believe have the potential for attractive returns, and (b) can be exploited in a manner consistent with the firm’s risk-controlled philosophy.

Value Opportunities

As an extension of Oaktree's highly successful Distressed Opportunities strategy, Value Opportunities offers an aggressive and opportunistic alternative, one designed to capitalize on changing market conditions

"When the environment is favorable for distressed debt, we have the flexibility to weight such investments more heavily," says Bruce Karsh, who has led Oaktree's Distressed Debt team since its inception. "When the supply is less plentiful, we will increase purchases of non-distressed value investments."

The strategy's broad focus allows the team to look at any level of the capital structure, and in value-oriented securities across developed markets, private placements, real estate, convertible securities and derivatives. In seeking bargain purchases, we favor obscure and out-of-favor opportunities and focus strongly on avoiding losses. We may use leverage, engage in shorting, and invest in stressed securities. We attempt at all times to emphasize holdings that provide liquidity.

The strategy's greatest strength is Oaktree's Distressed Debt group, with its vast experience, expertise in company valuation and access to value investing opportunities.
