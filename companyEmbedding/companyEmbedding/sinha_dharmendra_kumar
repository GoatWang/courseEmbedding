I hav lightish yellow marks on my teeth. Can I go for cleaning n polishing with dentist.













Dr.
						Yasmin Asma Zohara

MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery

Dentist, Chennai

















The simplest method of removing minor surface stains is polishing, or micro-abrasion if staining is more intrinsic. Provided that your discolouration is not due to inadequate enamel exposing the dentin, tooth whitening (bleaching) is often the most effective treatment for yellow stained teeth. Advance procedures can be done with laser. Use snowdent tooth paste for whitening until then. Apply snowdent paste on the teeth. Wait for 10 to 15 min. Then brush your teeth with the same paste. Applying it overnight for better results.

I am having sensitivity problem to tooth. It's painful even if I have cold or hot water.













Dr.
						Krinita Motwani

Advanced Aesthetics, BDS

Dentist, Mumbai

















Hi,
teeth have a protective layer called enamel with age the enamel wears off and become thin which causes to become teeth sensitive to cold and hot. You need to get a professional check up done to know the exact cause and solution of your problem.

I am suffering from a small, shallow sore inside the mouth or at the base of the gums. What should I take ?













Dr.
						Yasmin Asma Zohara

MDS - Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery

Dentist, Chennai

















If the mouth ulcer is causing a lot of pain, gently rub a small ice cube over the spot or rinse your mouth with ice-cold water. You could also chew on a clove bud (lavang) and direct the juice generated to the area where the ulcer is located. Clove buds are a great ingredient to cure sore throat too. To prevent the ulcerated area from getting infected, make it a point to rinse your mouth with a little salt water. Remember, this won’t make the ulcer disappear, but it can help reduce the pain.
Honey is a natural humectant. It helps reduce scarring and hastens the process of new tissue growth. This, along with its anti-microbial effect ensures faster healing of the mouth ulcer.
Chew a few leaves of tulsi along with some water about three to four times every day. This will help in getting rid of ulcers faster and also have a preventive action against their recurrence.
Applying a little coconut oil directly onto the mouth ulcer or chewing some coconut (fresh or dry) helps reduce pain and inflammation and hence, ulcers heal faster.
Mix some sugar to crushed khus-khus seeds and consume this mixture for instant relief from ulcers.
You could apply a little ghee directly to the ulcerated area, or drink a glass of buttermilk two or three times every day.
Mouth ulcers left untreated generally go away in a week or so; with these home remedies, you can expect faster relief. However, if you notice an ulcer in the mouth that is persistently present although it does not cause you any pain, do not neglect it or try to treat it with home remedies beyond a few days. Make it a point to see a doctor soon because often, a painless mouth ulcer is one of the earliest signs of oral cancer.

Dr.
						Souvagya Ranjan Kar

Dentist, Cuttack

















Tooth ache should not be taken lightly. It might mimick some other condition also. So please tell the nature of pain and when does it start and when does it end. Does it linger, does cil food or hot food affect the type of pain or does any hard food precipitate it. Do inform us. If possible just upload the pic of the tooth.

I'm 22 year old male. Every morning saliva forms in my mouth unusually as soon as I realize that I'm awake. Even I spit it once, it forms again and this thing repeats again and again until I brush in the morning. This thing also happens before sleep at night many times where I don't brush and slowly fall asleep with continuously spitting the saliva. This thing is happening to me for 7 months from now but never happened before. What should I do?













Dr.
						Ramneek Gupta

DHMS (Diploma in Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery)

Homeopath, Ludhiana

















Hypersalivation also called ptyalism is excessive production of saliva. It has also been defined as increased amount of saliva in the mouth, which may also be caused by decreased clearance of saliva.Hypersalivation can contribute to drooling if there is an inability to keep the mouth closed or in difficulty in swallowing the excess saliva (dysphagia).
Reasons for Hypersalivation are----------
1.Gastroesophageal reflux disease, in such cases specifically called a water brash, and is characterized by a sour fluid or almost tasteless saliva in the mouth.
2.Excessive starch intake
3.Mouth ulcers.
4.Oral infections
5.Liver Problems
6.Medicines----certain medicines initiate salivation if you are presently on medicines for any problem.
Treatment of your problem can be done by treating the underlioned factor causing salivation.

Dr.
						Rajesh Ahal

A.C.C.I - Accredited and Certified Course in Implantology, MDS - Pediatric & Preventive Dentistry, BDS

Dentist, Jammu





Dear ,
the fact that blood is coming out on washing one's mouth is inidicative of inflammation in the gums. Inflammation in the gums is generally due to tartar/ calculus deposits or food remaining stuck there. So, it is important for us to have the same checked by a good dental surgeon and follow up with the recommended dental treatment.

If your mouth feels dry after taking a lot of medicines, you should increase your fluid intake or use an artificial saliva product or chew a sugarless gum after a meal as it will help moisten your mouth.
