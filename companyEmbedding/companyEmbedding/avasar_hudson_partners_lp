Investment Strategy




  We believe that the market offers attractive investment opportunities at various points during the business cycle. As a result, our underlying philosophy of preparation, discipline and patience should enable us to take advantage of such opportunities to generate substantial returns.
We utilize a fundamental research driven long/short equity strategy to invest across sectors and market capitalizations. Allocation of capital is through best ideas portfolio with careful consideration to price and corresponding size of the position. Capital is deployed opportunistically to take advantage of market stress and price volatility. Investment selection is supported by detailed analysis, knowledge and investment experience.
We seek to invest in companies that we have studied and as such understand well. We prefer companies that face attractive industry dynamics, have clear competitive advantages and are led by managers skilled in disciplined capital allocation. Such companies are able to generate strong and sustainable free cash flow over an extended period of time.
