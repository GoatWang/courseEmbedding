The Sumitomo Life Insurance Company of Japan said on Tuesday that it had agreed to acquire Symetra Financial Corporation, an American provider of insurance and financial products, for about $3.8 billion.The deal is the latest by a Japanese insurer seeking to expand its operations into the United States, the world’s largest insurance market, as an aging Japanese population is expected to cut into results.Symetra would give Sumitomo Life its first real foothold in the United States.Under the terms of the deal, Symetra shareholders will receive $32 a share in cash, and a special dividend of 50 cents a share. The deal represents a 32 percent premium to the company’s average share price over the 30 days that ended Aug. 5.“We are enthusiastic about the opportunity to acquire Symetra’s dynamic business and believe that a transaction will be mutually beneficial and will create significant value for both Symetra and Sumitomo Life,” Masahiro Hashimoto, the president and chief executive of Sumitomo Life, said in a news release.

Founded in 1957, Symetra, based in Bellevue, Wash., provides annuities, life insurance and employee benefits. It posted revenue of $2.18 billion in 2014 and has about 1,400 employees.“This transaction will bring compelling strategic and financial benefits for Symetra, including providing a substantial cash premium to our shareholders,” Thomas M. Marra, president and chief executive of Symetra, said in a news release.Symetra’s largest shareholders, White Mountains Insurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway, have agreed to vote in favor of the transaction. They collectively own about 35 percent of the company’s shares.“Tom and his management team have done a good job running the company and have executed a great deal for shareholders,” Warren E. Buffett, the Berkshire Hathaway chairman and chief executive, said in a news release, referring to Mr. Marra.

The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. It is expected to close in the second quarter of 2016.Japanese life insurers have been seeking to acquire companies overseas, in recent years, particularly in other parts of Asia and in the United States, as they look to diversify their revenue streams outside their home country.In July, the Meiji Yasuda Life Insurance Company agreed to acquire the StanCorp Financial Group for $5 billion in cash. In June, Tokio Marine Holdings announced that it would acquire HCC Insurance Holdings for $7.5 billion in cash, one of a series of deals it has undertaken in the United States since 2008.Other Japanese companies seeking growth overseas include Dai-ichi Life Insurance, which announced an agreement to buy the American company Protective Life Corporation in 2014 for about $5.7 billion.

If the deal announced on Tuesday is completed, Symetra would serve as Sumitomo Life’s platform in the United States and would continue to operate under its current brand.The company would be led by Mr. Marra, the Symetra chief executive, and the current management team would continue to be based in Bellevue.Founded in 1907, Sumitomo Life is one of Japan’s largest insurers, selling life insurance, annuities and group products. It had total premiums of 2.18 trillion yen, or about $17.5 billion, in 2014 and has more than 42,000 employees.Morgan Stanley and the law firm Cravath, Swaine & Moore advised Symetra.

Symetra is a United States-based family of companies providing retirement plans, employee benefits, annuities and life insurance through independent distributors nationwide. The main headquarters of the company is located in Bellevue, Washington. Started in 1957, Symetra Financial began as a subsidiary of Safeco. In 1967, the total amount of insurance in force for Symetra surpassed the $1 billion mark. By 1995, the total assets had grown to $10 billion. In 2004, Safeco sold its life insurance business to an investor group led by White Mountains Insurance Group and Berkshire Hathaway.[1]
Symetra Financial was eventually acquired by Japanese insurer Sumitomo Life for $3.8billion. The Japanese insurer was looking to expand its foothold on insurance especially with an aging Japanese market.[2]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
