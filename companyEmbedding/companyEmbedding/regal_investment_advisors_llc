About Me



Steven Ryan is a 13 year Veteran in the financial services industry.  Steve graduated with a Bachelor’s Degree from Michigan State University, and he carries FINRA series 6, 7, 63, 65 and Life insurance licenses. He started his financial advising career with a large insurance company.  After building a successful book of business, he decided that he could serve his clients better by starting his own financial advising company.  Managed Wealth Solutions was born and is associated with Regal Investment Advisors and American Portfolios.  This allows for a less limited and non-bias financial solution for clients. Steven specializes in personal financial planning and management as well as the Higher Education retirement plans.





Steve resides in the Kalamazoo, Mi area with his wife Lori and daughters Hanna and Kira.  In his free time, he enjoys family activities, boating, golf and is an avid snowmobiler and power sports enthusiast.






Managed Wealth Solutions



Managed Wealth Solutions is a Wealth, Asset and Risk Management company.  We help clients create a personalized financial plan for addressing their wants and needs for today through retirement.  This includes creating a cash flow plan and reducing or removing the risk of losing the cash flow by means of tax codes, professional wealth management and utilizing the proper insurance products.




Additionally, we help address estate planning issues and work with accountants and lawyers to make sure that you and your family and/or heirs receive the benefits that you want them to receive.  Many people do not even have wills, not to mention the correct LPOAs or HPOAs.  This is a vital portion of true financial and life planning.


We have deep roots in the Higher Education field and have many years of experience in designing, implementing and maintaining the retirement plans for local community colleges.  We have exclusive agreements that allow us at Managed Wealth Solutions to take the stressful task of managing your Higher Ed retirement accounts off of your shoulders and we can manage them for you.   A high percentage of individuals will set up an asset allocation when they get hired and never change it.  Funds change, managers change and financial plans change.  We do not want you to miss the management advantage we can provide.


We like to keep you in touch with the market and if you so choose, we  can send out monthly or quarterly market updates from top managers to let you be “in the know”. Simply, our job is clear.  We help you define your financial goals, help you create the path to them and then provide you with the expertise and tools to make sure you achieve your goals. That is what we do at Managed Wealth Solutions. Please let us help you create and manage your financial plan so you have more time to do the things you enjoy the most.

Regal Charitable

Regal Charitable (RC) can help you fulfill your philanthropic goals and create your legacy through our Donor-Advised Fund Program. A Donor-Advised Fund is a simple way to pass on your values and assets to the next generation.
RC will work with you to help create a customized giving plan to support qualified charities. You will benefit from a charitable tax deduction while allowing your investments to grow tax-free. This gives you the opportunity to plan how to support your favorite charities in order to provide the largest impact. We offer customized solutions and guide you through the sometimes difficult process of transferring your assets while sharing your values with your heirs and/or benefactors.
 

 
We are proud to team with organizations like Gift Planning Services, LLC, and Renaissance Charitable Foundation. Through a rigorous planning process, we outline your goals, desired outcomes and construct a plan that has the best desired outcome for you and your benefactors.
Our hope is to serve you and your family, corporation, academic institution, and/or charitable organization with helpful information. Thank you for taking the time to explore the benefits of gift planning.

Integrity
 Integrity should guide every decision in your business and personal life. We believe this is a relationship business and without integrity, you cannot have relationships. We have a platform, and more importantly, a culture where your clients’ priorities come first.


Innovation
 The old ways of doing business are dying. Many firms are stuck doing business the same way they did 10 or 20 years ago because they are afraid of new ideas. Regal has been successful because we embrace innovation.


Independence
 Regal was conceived by a group of forward thinking entrepreneurs who believe that independence is the path to a higher quality of life. We think the more you help others gain their financial freedom, the more you have a chance to build your own. That’s our independent declaration.





Independence: Redefined

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
