Alternative Strategies


Overview


Special Situations


Multi-Strategy



Overview

Spring Mountain Capital's alternative strategies group employs an opportunistic approach to investing and focuses on investments in high value, overlooked areas that are neglected due to size, illiquidity and/or complexity. The approach to asset allocation within alternative and traditional investing strategies must be dynamic, flexible and forward-thinking.

We believe that the current investment environment will be challenging for traditional asset allocation strategies and that successful investors will need to be open-minded and willing to leverage their experience and expertise to consider interesting, non-traditional investment opportunities. We are comfortable evaluating misunderstood asset classes, orphaned securities and undiscovered managers and trading strategies. Throughout our history, we have created structures with the goal of maximizing return potential for investors.

Our history, reputation and experience provide us with a vast network of alternative asset managers and industry thought leaders, enabling us to formulate and execute innovative investment products for our partners.

Overview


Spring Mountain Capital's private equity group makes growth equity investments principally in technology-enabled and healthcare companies in the U.S. lower middle market. We make value investments in companies participating in high growth sectors of the U.S. economy that may benefit from break-through innovations, fundamental market changes and paradigm shifts. Within these "big wave" sectors, we look for opportunities whose growth potential and value are obscured because of mis-staging, complexity and inefficient capital raising for small capitalization companies.  
  
We benefit from being a part of a larger platform through enhanced deal flow, cross-pollination of ideas across our business units and access to an institutional-quality infrastructure. During our combined 150+ years of finance and investment experience, our team has developed a robust network of relationships that generate significant deal flow and provide access to seasoned industry professionals.

Spring Mountain Capital Leads New Round of Financing in Activate Healthcare

NEW YORK, June 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Activate Healthcare, a leading provider of workplace health clinics, announced today that it raised an additional growth equity funding round from Spring Mountain Capital.  
The funding will help Activate Healthcare accelerate the national expansion of its unique healthcare delivery model. Activate Healthcare is transforming primary care by developing and managing the next generation of workplace health clinics. On average, Activate clients see a $2-4 return for every dollar they invest in a clinic, and employee participation is often in excess of 90%. Unlike other models, Activate dedicates a full-time physician and a wellness coach to each clinic, so employees receive proactive, preventative, relationship-based primary care.   
"We are excited by the continued commitment from Spring Mountain Capital," said Activate Healthcare principal and co-founder Peter Dunn. "This investment will allow Activate to continue to provide exemplary quality of care to all of our patients, while expanding our leading on-site primary care model across the U.S."
In today's healthcare system, reduced reimbursement rates have forced physicians to also reduce time spent with each patient. As a result, primary care has evolved into a reactive, episodic, acute care-oriented model that is less able to manage chronic diseases and less effective in providing preventative care. Activate Healthcare is transforming healthcare by empowering employees and their families to take charge of their healthcare and employers to take charge of healthcare costs.
"We've been very pleased with the Activate Healthcare solution. The integration of a physician and health coach in caring for our employees is a major improvement. Having the health care clinic is one of the top benefits we offer our employees, and they really like the convenience and cost-savings it offers," said Natalie Roberts, Senior Vice President, Monarch Beverage.
"We are empowering physicians to practice medicine the way it used to be practiced: developing long-term relationships with patients, providing preventative care, educating patients and activating them to take control of their health," said Activate principal and co-founder Debra Geihsler. "We have shown that our approach to primary care medicine generates significant cost savings while improving the quality of care." 
Dunn and Geihsler founded Activate Healthcare in 2009. The Company has over 20 clinics throughout the Midwest and currently serves more than 45,000 patients. During 2014, Activate grew annualized revenue over 140%, has continued its strong growth trajectory through the first half of 2015 and is beginning to expand its business outside of the Midwest.
"We are excited to deepen our partnership with Activate," said Jamie Weston, Managing Director in Spring Mountain Capital's private equity group. "We believe that Activate is transforming the way primary care will be delivered and our private equity team is pleased to be able to support the company as they offer their innovative healthcare delivery model nationally."
