Mario J. Gabelli, C.F.A                                                         
Portfolio Manager                                                               

Objective: Growth of capital. Current income is a                               
secondary objective.                                                            

Portfolio: Primarily common and preferred stocks and other securities           
representing the right to acquire common stocks                                 

Inception: May 1, 1995                                                          

Net Assets at December 31, 2001: $193,150,041                                   

Q:    How did the Fund perform this year?                                       

A: For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Gabelli Capital Asset Fund rose    
2.56%.(1) The S&P 500 Index(2) declined 11.88% while the Russell 2000 Index(3)  
rose 2.49% over the same period. Each index is an unmanaged indicator of stock  
market performance. For the three-year period ended December 31, 2001, the      
Fund's total return averaged 9.06% annually, versus an average annual total     
return of -1.03% for the S&P 500 Index and an average annual total return of    
6.42% for the Russell 2000 Index.                                               

     For the five-year period ended December 31, 2001, the Fund's total return
averaged 15.62% annually, versus average annual total returns of 10.70% and     
7.52% for the S&P 500 and Russell 2000 Indices, respectively. Since its         
inception on May 1, 1995 through December 31, 2001, the Fund had a cumulative   
total return of 148.53%, which equates to an average annual total return of     
14.61%.                                                                         

Q:    What factors affected the Fund's performance in 2001?                     

A: Value stocks held up considerably better than growth stocks as evidenced by  
the value-oriented Dow Jones Industrial Average's(4) performance relative to the
growth-oriented S&P 500 Index and NASDAQ Composite Index.(5) The fact that a    
significant percentage of the portfolio is in small cap stocks also worked in   
our favor, as the Russell 2000 Index, which is generally considered to be       
representative of small cap issues in the U.S. stock market, was the only widely
followed market index finishing 2001 in the black. The Fund was up 2.56% in this
challenging market.                                                             

Q:    In what sectors do you see value?                                         

A: Advertising-supported media stocks performed quite poorly this year until    
rallying strongly in the fourth quarter. With the general economic malaise,     
corporate advertising budgets were shrinking and revenues and earnings for media
companies declined sharply.                                                     

 After September 11, everyone expected things to go from bad to worse.
Amazingly, thanks to the courageous American consumer, the economy held up      
remarkably well, and although corporate advertising spending has not yet        
increased, investors began anticipating better days ahead and taking advantage  
of outstanding bargains. With the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics and America's  
patriotic fervor promising good ratings, broadcasters should get a shot in the  
arm. Also, with partisan politics rearing its ugly head over a fiscal stimulus  
package and control of the Senate up for grabs, we can expect mid-term election 
political advertising to be strong. We believe advertising media supported      
earnings will surprise on the upside in the quarters ahead, helping sustain the 
strong rally we witnessed in the fourth quarter. Also, significant changes in   
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules and policies have set the stage   
for another round of consolidation in the media sector.                         

     In general, we believe merger and acquisition activity will accelerate in
the year ahead. As is usually the case during recessions and bear markets, deal 
activity slowed considerably in 2001. Fewer deals get done when it is difficult 
to accurately assess a target company's intermediate-term revenue and profit    
prospects and/or confidently project the future value of an acquiring company's 
stock as deal currency. However, recessions and declining stock markets usually 
set the stage for accelerating merger and

(1)   Total return figures are historical and assume the reinvestment of        
   dividends and distributions and the deduction of all Fund expenses. The
actual total returns for owners of the variable annuity contracts or
    variable life insurance policies that provide for investment in the Fund
  will be lower to reflect separate account and contract/policy charges.
    Past performance is not a guarantee of future results. Investment return
 and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when
redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost.         
(2)   The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of 500 primarily large-cap stocks 
  that is generally considered to be representative of U.S. stock market
      activity. The S&P 500 Index is not available for direct investment and its
     returns do not reflect the fees and expenses that have been deducted from
the Fund                                                            
(3)   The Russell 2000 Index is an unmanaged index that is generally considered 
 to be representative of small-capitalization issues in the U.S. stock
     market. The Russell 2000 Index is not available for direct investment and
 its returns do not reflect expenses that are deducted from the Fund's
returns.                                                            
(4)   The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is an unmanaged index of 30       
    industrial stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is generally
considered to be representative of U.S. stock market activity.      
(5)   The NASDAQ Composite Index is a broad-based capitalization-weighted index 
of all NASDAQ National Market stocks. The Index is not available for
  direct investment and its returns do not reflect the fees and expenses
that have been deducted from the Fund.

acquisition activity. The reason is simple--there are more bargains available.  
Once the economic and market dust settles, these bargains tend to get snapped up
in a hurry.                                                                     

Q:    What is your outlook for the year 2002?                                   

A: Economic data released at the end of December was quite encouraging. Consumer
confidence continued to improve. Growth in new unemployment insurance claims was
slowing. There was even a modest up-tick in business investment. These are all  
valid signs the economy is regaining its footing. At issue is just how strong   
the economic recovery will be. Although inventories have come down              
substantially, there is still considerable excess capacity in the manufacturing 
sector. Until this excess capacity is reduced, business investment will likely  
remain anemic. This means consumers will have to continue to carry the economy  
on their backs. We believe Gross Domestic Product(6) (GDP) will be up 3% to 4%  
in 2002, well above the longer-term growth of 2.5% to 3% we envision. The cut in
taxes along with lower oil and fuel prices will help consumer spending overcome 
the drag from the stock market's wealth effect and rising unemployment.         

Fortunately, we will not need an especially strong recovery to see  
significantly better corporate earnings in 2002. Companies in virtually every   
industry have been aggressively cutting costs. With the exception of pockets in 
the technology and telecommunications equipment industries, the inventory       
correction has largely run its course. Corporate interest expense has declined, 
as have raw materials and energy prices. Corporate America wrote off everything 
it could get away with in 2001 (we call this the "kitchen sink" effect), and due
to Federal Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Rule 142, the "amortization of     
goodwill" will no longer penalize earnings. Consequently, we believe a modest   
economic recovery in the year ahead should be magnified in sharply higher       
reported earnings. Very "easy" earnings comparisons in the first and second     
quarters of 2002 should help stabilize the market until investors gain          
confidence that earnings will improve in the second half. In addition, the      
crisis in confidence arising from "Enron" will result in auditing firms and     
CFO's cleaning up their numbers (we expect that aggressive accounting will be   
back - but not in 2002).

The following are stock specifics on selected holdings of our Fund. 
Favorable earnings prospects do not necessarily translate into higher stock     
prices, but they do express a positive trend which we believe will develop over 
time.

revenues, provides investment advisory services and financial products such as

groups: Electronic Instruments and Electromechanical. In Electronic Instruments,
the company continues to make acquisitions to augment growth. Last year AMETEK  
purchased EDAX Inc., and in January 2002 it bought the Instruments for Research 
and Applied Science. These two companies measure physical properties such as    
metal purity, environmental monitoring and radiation detection. They have had   
above average growth and have been less cyclical than the general industrial    
economy. At the Electromechanical Group, AMETEK's key strategy is to reduce     
costs by increasing efficiency and moving non-core operations to low cost       
countries such as Mexico, the Czech Republic and China. The execution of these  
two strategies and the company's strong cash flow should enable AMETEK to boost 
future earnings.                                                                

      Gaylord Entertainment Co. is a diversified entertainment company operating
principally in two segments: hospitality and media. The company's hospitality   
group consists of an interrelated group of businesses including the Opryland    
Hotel Nashville, the Inn at Opryland, the General Jackson (an entertainment     
showboat), and other related businesses. The media group consists primarily of  
the Grand Ole Opry, the Ryman Auditorium, the Wildhorse Saloon, Acuff-Rose Music
Publishing, three Nashville radio stations, and other related businesses.       
Gaylord has a new management team that is focusing on unlocking shareholder     
value.                                                                          

 General Motors Corp. is the largest producer of motor vehicles in the
world, with unit sales of over 8 million cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles  
in 2001 alone. The company has operating subsidiaries in North America, Europe, 
Latin America, and Asia, and equity interests in manufacturers in Europe (Fiat  
Auto Holdings) and Japan (Isuzu, Suzuki, Subaru). General Motors Acceptance     
Corporation provides retail and wholesale financing to consumers and dealers    
worldwide, as well as vehicle leasing, mortgage, and insurance products. The    
company's Hughes Electronics subsidiary provides direct-to-home satellite       
television services to over 10 million consumers in the U.S. under the DirecTV  
brand name.                                                                     

   Media General Inc. is a Richmond, Virginia-based communications company
that is primarily focused on the Southeast. Its newspaper publishing operations 
include The Richmond Times-Dispatch, The Winston-Salem Journal, The Tampa       
Tribune, and 22 other daily newspapers. Five of these daily newspapers,         
clustered in Alabama and South Carolina, were acquired by the company from      
Thomson Corp. for $237 million in August 2000. The company also owns a 20       
percent interest in the Denver Post. Media General also operates twenty-six     
television stations primarily located in Southeastern markets, including eight  
purchased from Spartan Communications on March 27, 2000 for $605 million. The   
company sold its Garden State Paper Co. to Enron Corp. for $72 million in August
2000, but still owns 33% of SP Newsprint Company.                               

  PepsiAmericas Inc. was formed by the merger of Whitman Corporation and
PepsiAmericas on November 30, 2000. PepsiAmericas markets, packages and         
distributes a portfolio of carbonated and non-carbonated beverages, primarily   
Pepsi-Cola, Dr. Pepper and Seven-Up brands in three regions: the central United 
States, Central Europe and the Caribbean. PepsiCo owns approximately 36.8% of   
the common shares outstanding.                                                  

      Standard Motor Products Inc., headquartered in Long Island City, New York,
supplies functional replacement parts for the engine management, electrical and 
climate control systems of cars, trucks and buses. The company services all     
makes and models, both new and old cars, imported and domestic. SMP has two     
primary divisions--engine management and temperature control--and believes it is
the number one supplier to the North American aftermarket in each of these      
lines.                                                                          

     Willamette Industries Inc. has taken several turns in its defense against
Weyerhaeuser Industries' hostile offer for the company. After Weyerhaeuser      
raised its offer to $55 per share in early December, the Willamette board       
continued to reject the proposal as inadequate. Willamette threatened to use the
"scorched earth" takeover defense by entering into talks to buy the building    
products division of Georgia Pacific. However, after weeks of negotiations with 
Georgia Pacific, on January 21, 2002, Willamette announced that it had ended    
talks with Georgia Pacific and had agreed in principle to a deal in which       
Weyerhaeuser would pay $55.50 per share for all outstanding shares of           
Willamette. The transaction is subject to the negotiation of a definitive merger
agreement and approval by the Weyerhaeuser and Willamette boards of directors.  
This new agreement should bring an end to the one of the most controversial     
takeover fights in recent memory.

    The Gabelli Capital Asset Fund (the "Fund"), a series of Gabelli Capital
Series Funds, Inc. (the "Company"), was organized on April 8, 1993 as a Maryland
corporation. The Company is a diversified, open-end management investment       
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The    
Fund's primary objective is growth of capital. The Fund commenced investment    
operations on May 1, 1995. Shares of the Fund are available to the public only  
through the purchase of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance    
contracts issued by The Guardian Insurance & Annuity Company, Inc. ("Guardian") 
and other selected insurance companies.

2. Significant Accounting Policies                                              
----------------------------------                                              

 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make  
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in   
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The 
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Fund  
in the preparation of its financial statements.                                 

Security Valuation.                                                             

Portfolio securities listed or traded on a nationally recognized    
securities exchange, quoted by the National Association of Securities Dealers   
Automated Quotations, Inc. ("Nasdaq") or traded in the U.S. over-the-counter    
market for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last 
quoted sale price on that exchange or market as of the close of business on the 
day the securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the       
security is valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if    
there were no asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at   
the closing bid price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such 
day, the security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the     
Board of Directors so determines, by such other method as the Board of Directors
shall determine in good faith, to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio      
securities traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are   
valued according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined  
by Gabelli Funds, LLC (the "Adviser"). Portfolio securities primarily traded on 
foreign markets are generally valued at the preceding closing values of such    
securities on their respective exchanges. Securities and assets for which market
quotations are not readily available are valued at their fair value as          
determined in good faith under procedures established by and under the general  
supervision of the Board of Directors. Short term debt securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board of 
Directors determine such does not reflect the securities fair value, in which   
case these securities will be valued at their fair value as determined by the   
Directors. Debt instruments having a maturity greater than 60 days for which    
market quotations are readily available are valued at the latest average of the 
bid and asked prices. If there were no asked prices quoted on such day, the     
security is valued using the closing bid price. Options are valued at the last  
sale price on the exchange on which they are listed. If no sales of such options
have taken place that day, they will be valued at the mean between their closing
bid and asked prices.                                                           

Securities Transactions and Investment Income.                                  

     Securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date with realized
gain or loss on the sale of investments determined by using the identified cost 
method. Interest income (including amortization of premium and accretion of     
discount) is recorded as earned. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend 
date.                                                                           

Dividends and Distributions to Shareholders.                                    

Dividends and distributions to shareholders are recorded on the     
ex-dividend date. Income and long-term capital gain distributions are determined
in accordance with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from        
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These differences
are primarily due to differing treatments of income and gains on various        
investment securities held by the Fund, timing differences and differing        
characterization of distributions made by the Fund.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, reclassifications were made to
decrease distributions in excess of net investment income for $19,184 with an   
offsetting adjustment to distributions in excess of net realized gain on        
investments.                                                                    

Provision for Income Taxes.                                                     

    The Fund has qualified and intends to continue to qualify as a regulated
investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as

Report of Independent Auditors                                                  

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Gabelli Capital Asset Fund (a     
series of Gabelli Capital Series Fund, Inc.)                                    

 We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,
including the portfolio of investments, of the Gabelli Capital Asset Fund (the  
"Fund") (a series of Gabelli Capital Series Fund, Inc.) as of December 31, 2001,
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements 
of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then ended, and
the financial highlights for each of the five years in the period then ended.   
These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of   
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these     
financial statements and financial highlights based on our audits.              

   We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform 
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes   
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the financial statements and financial highlights. Our procedures included      
confirmation of securities owned as of December 31, 2001, by correspondence with
the custodian and brokers. An audit also includes assessing the accounting      
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as        
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our    
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

      In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of    
Gabelli Capital Asset Fund at December 31, 2001, and the results of its         
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of   
the two years in the period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the five years in the period then ended, in conformity with accounting

Gabelli Equity Series Funds, Inc










The Gabelli Equity Income Fund
 
Annual Report — September 30, 2016
  

 
 
Mario J. Gabelli, CFA
Portfolio Manager
To 
Our Shareholders, 
For the year ended September 30, 2016, the net asset value 
(“NAV”) per Class AAA Share of The Gabelli Equity Income Fund increased 
11.3% compared with an increase of 15.4% for the Standard & Poor’s 
(“S&P”) 500 Index. See page 3 for additional performance information. 
Enclosed are the financial statements, including the schedule of 
investments, as of September 30, 2016. 
Performance 
Discussion (Unaudited) 
Our stock selection process is based on the investment principles 
of Graham and Dodd, the first investors to articulate the fundamentals of value 
investing. Their work provided the framework for value investing, and we 
contributed to this framework with the discipline of Private Market Value with a 
Catalyst®. This 
proprietary research and valuation method identifies companies whose shares are 
selling at a discount to intrinsic value, with an identifiable path to 
realizing, or surfacing, that private market value. We define private market 
value as the price an informed acquirer would pay for an entire enterprise. The 
catalyst comprises identifiable events or circumstances that might reasonably 
result in the narrowing of the difference between the public market price of the 
stock and our estimate of the private market value. This realization of value 
can take place gradually or suddenly, with company specific changes such as 
management changes or restructurings, sale of assets or of the business as a 
whole, or industry changes such as changes in regulation or changes in 
competition. 
The market volatility exhibited in 2015 continued into the quarter 
ending March 31, 2016, as a sharply negative January preceded a flattish 
February, followed by a March recovery. Driving much of these rotations were 
uneven economic data, global concerns (namely the Chinese economy and oil 
production), and speculation about interest rate increases and their timing. 
Near the close of the quarter, the Federal Reserve left short term interest 
rates unchanged in its March meeting and suggested a cautious approach to rate 
hikes for the rest of the year. 
During the quarter ended June 30, investors’ worries shifted 
from a collapse in China, to a recession in the U.S. and increasing oil prices, 
and finally, to Brexit; the United Kingdom’s vote to exit the European Union 
(EU). The vote to leave the EU sparked a market correction, amplifying economic 
uncertainty, increasing volatility, and driving down the pound. However, these 
events were quickly followed by a strong bounce back to earlier, more stable 
levels. 
The quarter ending September 30 saw a mixed set of data, 
including an improvement in consumer spending. The overall market was up low 
single digits. However, core income growth, meaning wages and salaries, has been 
in a slowing trend for over a year. The long term slow growth in GDP has 
resulted in low sales growth for corporations, which has put downward pressure 
on profits and capital spending. This has been part of the circle of low growth 
and more accommodative monetary and fiscal policies, not just in the United 
States, but globally. 
 


Among the better performing stocks for the fiscal year were: 
Navistar International Corp. (0.3% of net assets as of September 30, 2016), 
an American holding company and manufacturer and marketer of medium and heavy 
trucks and mid-range diesel engines. In 
September, Navistar and Volkswagen Truck & Bus announced a long 
anticipated strategic alliance in which the two truck manufacturers would share 
technology and purchasing efforts in exchange for VW taking a $256 million 
stake (16.6%) in Navistar. Natural gas company Spectra Energy Corp. (0.1%); and 
gold producer Freeport-McMoRan Inc. (0.1%) also performed well. On 
September 6, 2016, Enbridge announced an agreement to merge with Spectra 
Energy Corp. for $40 per share, or $28 billion enterprise value, to create 
the largest energy infrastructure company in North America. All three holdings 
returned over 60% for the year. 
Some of our weaker performers were Weatherford International plc 
(0.1%); asset manager Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. (0.1%); and tax 
preparation company H&R Block Inc. (0.3%). Waddell & Reed’s 
investment performance has been weaker which has led to outflows in their funds. 
The company has announced restructuring to cut costs. H&R Block had poor 
execution during tax season and lost market share due to tax preparation 
software Turbo Tax. 
We appreciate your confidence and trust.

(a)

Returns represent past performance and do not guarantee 
      future results. Total returns and average annual returns reflect changes 
      in share price, reinvestment of distributions, and are net of expenses. 
      Investment returns and the principal value of an investment will 
      fluctuate. When shares are redeemed, they may be worth more or less than 
      their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the 
      performance data presented. Visit www.gabelli.com for performance 
      information as of the most recent month end. The Fund imposes a 2% 
      redemption fee on shares sold or exchanged within seven days after the 
      date of purchase. Investors should carefully consider the investment 
      objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Fund before investing. The 
      prospectuses contain information about these and other matters and should 
      be read carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus please visit 
      www.gabelli.com. The Class AAA Share NAVs are used to calculate 
      performance for the periods prior to the issuance of Class A Shares 
      and Class C Shares on December 31, 2003 and Class I Shares 
      on January 11, 2008. The actual performance of the Class A 
      Shares and Class C Shares would have been lower due to the additional 
      fees and expenses associated with these classes of shares. The actual 
      performance of the Class I Shares would have been higher due to lower 
      expenses related to this class of shares. The S&P 500 Index is a 
      market capitalization weighted index of 500 large capitalization stocks 
      commonly used to represent the U.S. equity market. The Nasdaq Composite 
      Index is an unmanaged indicator of stock market performance. The Lipper 
      Equity Income Fund Average includes the 30 largest equity funds in this 
      category tracked by Lipper, Inc. Dividends are considered reinvested, 
      except for the Nasdaq Composite Index. You cannot invest directly in an 
      index.

of Fund Expenses (Unaudited)

      September 30, 2016
  

Expense Table
 



We believe it is important for you to understand the impact of 
fees and expenses regarding your investment. All mutual funds have operating 
expenses. As a shareholder of a fund, you incur ongoing costs, which include 
costs for portfolio management, administrative services, and shareholder reports 
(like this one), among others. Operating expenses, which are deducted from a 
fund’s gross income, directly reduce the investment return of a fund. When a 
fund’s expenses are expressed as a percentage of its average net assets, this 
figure is known as the expense ratio. The following examples are intended to 
help you understand the ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in your Fund and 
to compare these costs with those of other mutual funds. The examples are based 
on an investment of $1,000 made at the beginning of the period shown and held 
for the entire period. 
The Expense Table below illustrates your Fund’s costs in two ways: 

Actual Fund Return: This section provides information about 
actual account values and actual expenses. You may use this section to help you 
to estimate the actual expenses that you paid over the period after any fee 
waivers and expense reimbursements. The “Ending Account Value” shown is derived 
from the Fund’s actual return during the past six months, and the 
“Expenses Paid During Period” shows the dollar amount that would have been paid 
by an investor who started with $1,000 in the Fund. You may use this 
information, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses 
that you paid over the period. 
To do so, simply divide your account value by $1,000 (for example, 
an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by 
the number given for your Fund under the heading “Expenses Paid During Period” 
to estimate the expenses you paid during this period. 
Hypothetical 5% Return: This section provides information 
about hypothetical account values and 

hypothetical expenses based on the Fund’s actual expense ratio. It 
assumes a hypothetical annualized return of 5% before expenses during the period 
shown. In this case – because the hypothetical return used is not
the Fund’s actual return – the results do not apply to your investment 
and you cannot use the hypothetical account value and expense to estimate the 
actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. This example 
is useful in making comparisons of the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund 
and other funds. To do so, compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% 
hypothetical examples that appear in shareholder reports of other funds. 
Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to 
highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs 
such as sales charges (loads), redemption fees, or exchange fees, if any, which 
are described in the Prospectus. If these costs were applied to your account, 
your costs would be higher. Therefore, the 5% hypothetical return is useful in 
comparing ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total 
costs of owning different funds. The “Annualized Expense Ratio” represents the 
actual expenses for the last six months and may be different from the expense 
ratio in the Financial Highlights which is for the year ended September 30, 
2016.

The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Notes 
to Financial Statements 
 
 
1. Organization. The Gabelli Equity Income Fund is a series 
of the Gabelli Equity Series Funds, Inc. (the “Corporation”). The Corporation 
was incorporated on July 25, 1991 in Maryland. The Fund is a diversified 
open-end management investment company 
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 
Act”), and one of three separately managed portfolios of the Corporation. The 
Fund seeks to provide a high level of total return on its assets with an 
emphasis on income. The Fund commenced investment operations on January 2, 
1992. 
2. Significant Accounting Policies. As an investment 
company, the Fund follows the investment company accounting and reporting 
guidance, which is part of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles 
(“GAAP”) that may require the use of management estimates and assumptions in the 
preparation of its financial statements. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies 
followed by the Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. 
Security Valuation. Portfolio securities listed or 
traded on a nationally recognized securities exchange or traded in the U.S. 
over-the-counter market for which 
market quotations are readily available are valued at the last quoted sale price 
or a market’s official closing price as of the close of business on the day the 
securities are being valued. If there were no sales that day, the security is 
valued at the average of the closing bid and asked prices or, if there were no 
asked prices quoted on that day, then the security is valued at the closing bid 
price on that day. If no bid or asked prices are quoted on such day, the 
security is valued at the most recently available price or, if the Board of 
Directors (the “Board”) so determines, by such other method as the Board shall 
determine in good faith to reflect its fair market value. Portfolio securities 
traded on more than one national securities exchange or market are valued 
according to the broadest and most representative market, as determined by 
Gabelli Funds, LLC (the “Adviser”). 
Portfolio securities primarily traded on a foreign market are 
generally valued at the preceding closing values of such securities on the 
relevant market, but may be fair valued pursuant to procedures established by 
the Board if market conditions change significantly after the close of the 
foreign market, but prior to the close of business on the day the securities are 
being valued. Debt instruments with remaining maturities of sixty days or less 
that are not credit impaired are valued at amortized cost, unless the Board 
determines such amount does not reflect the securities’ fair value, in which 
case these securities will be fair valued as determined by the Board. Debt 
instruments having a maturity greater than sixty days for which market 
quotations are readily available are valued at the average of the latest bid and 
asked prices. If there were no asked prices quoted on such day, the security is 
valued using the closing bid price. U.S. government obligations with maturities 
greater than sixty days are normally valued using a model that incorporates 
market observable data such as reported sales of similar securities, broker 
quotes, yields, bids, offers, and reference data. Certain securities are valued 
principally using dealer quotations. 
Securities and assets for which market quotations are not readily 
available are fair valued as determined by the Board. Fair valuation 
methodologies and procedures may include, but are not limited to: analysis and 
review of available financial and non-financial information about the company; 
comparisons with the valuation and changes in valuation of similar securities, 
including a comparison of foreign securities with the equivalent U.S. dollar 
value American Depositary Receipt securities at the close of the U.S. exchange; 
and evaluation of any other information that could be indicative of the value of 
the security.

The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Notes 
to Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
 
The inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value of 
the Fund’s investments are summarized into three levels as described in the 
hierarchy below: 
 










 

· Level 1 —
 

quoted prices in active markets for identical 
    securities;






 

· Level 2 —
 

other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices 
      for similar securities, interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risk, 
      etc.); and






 

· Level 3 —
 

significant unobservable inputs (including the Board’s 
      determinations as to the fair value of 
investments).
A financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is 
based on the lowest level of any input both individually and in the aggregate 
that is significant to the fair value measurement. The inputs or methodology 
used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk 
associated with investing in those securities. The summary of the Fund’s 
investments in securities by inputs used to value the Fund’s investments as of 
September 30, 2016 is as follows:

(a)

Please refer to the Schedule of Investments for the industry 
      classifications of these portfolio holdings. 
The Fund did not have material transfers among Level 1, 
Level 2, and Level 3 during the year ended 
September 30, 2016. The Fund’s policy is to recognize transfers among 
Levels as of the beginning of the reporting period. 
Additional 
Information to Evaluate Qualitative Information. 
    General. The Fund uses 
recognized industry pricing services – approved by the Board and unaffiliated 
with the Adviser – to value most of its securities, and uses broker quotes 
provided by market makers of securities not valued by these and other recognized 
pricing sources. Several different pricing feeds are received to value domestic 
equity securities, international equity securities, preferred equity securities, 
and fixed income securities. The data within these feeds is ultimately sourced 
from major stock exchanges and trading systems where these securities trade. The 
prices supplied by external sources are checked by obtaining quotations or 
actual transaction prices from market participants. If a price obtained from the 
pricing source is deemed unreliable, prices will be sought from another pricing 
service or from a broker/dealer that trades that security or similar securities. 

    Fair Valuation. Fair valued 
securities may be common and preferred equities, warrants, options, rights, and 
fixed income obligations. Where appropriate, Level 3 securities are those 
for which market quotations are not available, such as securities not traded for 
several days, or for which current bids are not available, or which are 
restricted as to transfer. Among the factors to be considered to fair value a 
security are recent prices 
 
16 


The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Notes 
to Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
 
of comparable securities that are publicly traded, reliable prices 
of securities not publicly traded, the use of valuation models, current analyst 
reports, valuing the income or cash flow of the issuer, or cost if the preceding 
factors do not apply. A significant change in the unobservable inputs could 
result in a lower or higher value in Level 3 securities. The circumstances 
of Level 3 securities are frequently monitored to determine if fair 
valuation measures continue to apply. 
The Adviser reports quarterly to the Board the results of the 
application of fair valuation policies and procedures. These may include back 
testing the prices realized in subsequent trades of these fair valued securities 
to fair values previously recognized. 
Derivative Financial Instruments. The Fund may 
engage in various portfolio investment strategies by investing in a number of 
derivative financial instruments for the purposes of increasing the income of 
the Fund, hedging against changes in the value of its portfolio securities and 
in the value of securities it intends to purchase, or hedging against a specific 
transaction with respect to either the currency in which the transaction is 
denominated or another currency. Investing in certain derivative financial 
instruments, including participation in the options, futures, or swap markets, 
entails certain execution, liquidity, hedging, tax, and securities, interest, 
credit, or currency market risks. Losses may arise if the Adviser’s prediction 
of movements in the direction of the securities, foreign currency, and interest 
rate markets is inaccurate. Losses may also arise if the counterparty does not 
perform its duties under a contract, or that, in the event of default, the Fund 
may be delayed in or prevented from obtaining payments or other contractual 
remedies owed to it under derivative contracts. The creditworthiness of the 
counterparties is closely monitored in order to minimize these risks. 
Participation in derivative transactions involves investment risks, transaction 
costs, and potential losses to which the Fund would not be subject absent the 
use of these strategies. The consequences of these risks, transaction costs, and 
losses may have a negative impact on the Fund’s ability to pay distributions. 

The Fund’s derivative contracts held at September 30, 2016, 
if any, are not accounted for as hedging instruments under GAAP and are 
disclosed in the Schedule of Investments together with the related counterparty. 

    Swap Agreements. The Fund 
may enter into equity contract for difference swap transactions for the purpose 
of increasing the income of the Fund. The use of swaps is a highly specialized 
activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those 
associated with ordinary portfolio security transactions. In an equity contract 
for difference swap, a set of future cash flows is exchanged between two 
counterparties. One of these cash flow streams will typically be based on a 
reference interest rate combined with the performance of a notional value of 
shares of a stock. The other will be based on the performance of the shares of a 
stock. Depending on the general state of short term interest rates and the 
returns on the Fund’s portfolio securities at the time an equity contract for 
difference swap transaction reaches its scheduled termination date, there is a 
risk that the Fund will not be able to obtain a replacement transaction or that 
the terms of the replacement will not be as favorable as on the expiring 
transaction. 
Unrealized gains related to swaps are reported as an asset and 
unrealized losses are reported as a liability in the Statement of Assets and 
Liabilities. The change in value of swaps, including the accrual of periodic 
amounts of interest to be received or paid on swaps, is reported as unrealized 
gain or loss in the Statement of Operations. A realized gain or loss is recorded 
upon payment or receipt of a periodic payment or termination of swap agreements. 
At September 30, 2016, the Fund held no investments in equity contract for 
difference swap agreements.

The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Notes

Securities Sold Short. The Fund may enter into short 
sale transactions. Short selling involves selling securities that may or may not 
be owned and, at times, borrowing the same securities for delivery to the 
purchaser, with an obligation to replace such borrowed securities at a later 
date. The proceeds received from short sales are recorded as liabilities and the 
Fund records an unrealized gain or loss to the extent of the difference between 
the proceeds received and the value of an open short position on the day of 
determination. The Fund records a realized gain or loss when the short position 
is closed out. By entering into a short sale, the Fund bears the market risk of 
an unfavorable change in the price of the security sold short. Dividends on 
short sales are recorded as an expense by the Fund on the ex-dividend date and interest expense is 
recorded on the accrual basis. The broker retains collateral for the value of 
the open positions, which is adjusted periodically as the value of the position 
fluctuates. At September 30, 2016, there were no short sales outstanding. 

Foreign Currency Translations. The books and records 
of the Fund are maintained in U.S. dollars. Foreign currencies, investments, and 
other assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars at current 
exchange rates. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income, and 
expenses are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the respective dates 
of such transactions. Unrealized gains and losses that result from changes in 
foreign exchange rates and/or changes in market prices of securities have been 
included in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments and foreign 
currency translations. Net realized foreign currency gains and losses resulting 
from changes in exchange rates include foreign currency gains and losses between 
trade date and settlement date on investment securities transactions, foreign 
currency transactions, and the difference between the amounts of interest and 
dividends recorded on the books of the Fund and the amounts actually received. 
The portion of foreign currency gains and losses related to fluctuation in 
exchange rates between the initial purchase trade date and subsequent sale trade 
date is included in realized gain/(loss) on investments. 
Foreign Securities. The Fund may directly purchase 
securities of foreign issuers. Investing in securities of foreign issuers 
involves special risks not typically associated with investing in securities of 
U.S. issuers. The risks include possible revaluation of currencies, the 
inability to repatriate funds, less complete financial information about 
companies, and possible future adverse political and economic developments. 
Moreover, securities of many foreign issuers and their markets may be less 
liquid and their prices more volatile than securities of comparable U.S. 
issuers. 
Foreign Taxes. The Fund may be subject to foreign 
taxes on income, gains on investments, or currency repatriation, a portion of 
which may be recoverable. The Fund will accrue such taxes and recoveries as 
applicable, based upon its current interpretation of tax rules and regulations 
that exist in the markets in which it invests. 
Restricted Securities. The Fund may invest up to 15% 
of its net assets in securities for which the markets are restricted. Restricted 
securities include securities whose disposition is subject to substantial legal 
or contractual restrictions. The sale of restricted securities often requires 
more time and results in higher brokerage charges or dealer discounts and other 
selling expenses than does the sale of securities eligible for trading on 
national securities exchanges or in the over-the-counter markets. Restricted 
securities may sell at a price lower than similar securities that are not 
subject to restrictions on resale. Securities freely saleable among qualified 
institutional investors under special rules adopted by the SEC may be treated as 
liquid if they satisfy liquidity standards established by the Board. The 
continued liquidity of such securities is not as well assured as that of 
publicly traded securities, and accordingly the Board will monitor their 
liquidity. At September 30, 2016, the Fund held no restricted securities.

Securities Transactions and Investment Income. 
Securities transactions are accounted for on the trade date with 
realized gain/(loss) on investments determined by using the identified cost 
method. Interest income (including amortization of premium and accretion of 
discount) is recorded on the accrual basis. Premiums and discounts on debt 
securities are amortized using the effective yield to maturity method. Dividend 
income is recorded on the ex-dividend 
date, except for certain dividends from foreign securities that are recorded as 
soon after the ex-dividend date as the 
Fund becomes aware of such dividends. 
Determination of Net Asset Value and Calculation of 
Expenses. Certain administrative expenses are common to, and allocated 
among, various affiliated funds. Such allocations are made on the basis of each 
fund’s average net assets or other criteria directly affecting the expenses as 
determined by the Adviser pursuant to procedures established by the Board. 
In calculating the NAV per share of each class, investment income, 
realized and unrealized gains and losses, redemption fees, and expenses other 
than class specific expenses are allocated daily to each class of shares based 
upon the proportion of net assets of each class at the beginning of each day. 
Distribution expenses are borne solely by the class incurring the expense. 
Distributions to Shareholders. Distributions to 
shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. Distributions to 
shareholders are based on income and capital gains as determined in accordance 
with federal income tax regulations, which may differ from income and capital 
gains as determined under GAAP. These differences are primarily due to differing 
treatments of income and gains on various investment securities and foreign 
currency transactions held by the Fund, timing differences, and differing 
characterizations of distributions made by the Fund. Distributions from net 
investment income for federal income tax purposes include net realized gains on 
foreign currency transactions. These book/tax differences are either temporary 
or permanent in nature. To the extent these differences are permanent, 
adjustments are made to the appropriate capital accounts in the period when the 
differences arise. Permanent differences were primarily due to 
recharacterization of distributions. These reclassifications have no impact on 
the NAV of the Fund. For the year ended September 30, 2016, 
reclassifications were made to decrease net investment income by $486,138 and 
decrease distributions in excess of net realized gain by $620,143, with an 
offsetting adjustment to paid-in 
capital. 
The tax character of distributions paid during the years ended 
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows:

Total distributions paid differs from the Statement of 
      Changes in Net Assets due to the utilization of equalization. 
  
The Fund has a fixed distribution policy. Under the policy, the 
Fund declares and pays monthly distributions from net investment income, capital 
gains, and paid-in capital. The actual 
source of the distribution is determined after the end of the calendar year. 
Pursuant to this policy, distributions during the calendar year are made in 
excess of required distributions. To the extent such distributions are made from 
current earnings and profits, they are considered ordinary income or long term 
capital gains. The Fund’s current distribution policy may restrict the Fund’s 
ability to pass through to shareholders all of its net realized long term 
capital gains as a

Capital Gain Dividend, subject to the maximum federal income tax 
rate of 20%, and may cause such gains to be treated as ordinary income subject 
to a maximum federal income tax rate of 39.6%. In addition, certain U.S. 
shareholders who are individuals, estates, or trusts and whose income exceeds 
certain thresholds will be required to pay 3.8% Medicare tax on their “net 
investment income,” which includes dividends received from the Fund and capital 
gains from the sale or other disposition of shares of the Fund. Distributions 
sourced from paid-in capital should not 
be considered as dividend yield or the total return from an investment in the 
Fund. The Board continues to evaluate its distribution policy in light of 
ongoing economic and market conditions and may change the amount of the monthly 
distributions in the future. 
Provision for Income Taxes. The Fund intends to 
continue to qualify as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). It is the policy of the 
Fund to comply with the requirements of the Code applicable to regulated 
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its net investment 
company taxable income and net capital gains. Therefore, no provision for 
federal income taxes is required. 
At September 30, 2016, the components of accumulated 
earnings/losses on a tax basis were as follows:

      unrealized appreciation on investments
  
$
840,267,466
  
At September 30, 2016, the temporary difference between book 
basis and tax basis net unrealized appreciation on investments was due to 
deferral of losses from wash sales for tax purposes and tax basis adjustments on 
investments in partnerships. 
The following summarizes the tax cost of investments and the 
related net unrealized appreciation at September 30, 2016:

The Fund is required to evaluate tax positions taken or expected 
to be taken in the course of preparing the Fund’s tax returns to determine 
whether the tax positions are “more-likely-than-not” of being sustained by 
the applicable tax authority. Income tax and related interest and penalties 
would be recognized by the Fund as tax expense in the Statement of Operations if 
the tax positions were deemed not to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold. For the year 
ended September 30, 2016, the Fund did not incur any income tax, interest, 
or penalties. As of September 30, 2016, the Adviser has reviewed all open 
tax years and concluded that there was no impact to the Fund’s net assets or 
results of operations. The Fund’s federal and state tax returns for the prior 
three fiscal years remain open, subject to examination. On an ongoing basis, the 
Adviser will monitor the Fund’s tax positions to determine if adjustments to 
this conclusion are necessary. 
3. Investment Advisory Agreement and Other Transactions. 
The Fund has entered into an investment advisory agreement (the “Advisory 
Agreement”) with the Adviser which provides that the Fund will pay the Adviser a 
fee, computed daily and paid monthly, at the annual rate of 1.00% of the value 
of its average daily net assets. In accordance with the Advisory Agreement, the 
Adviser provides a continuous investment program for the Fund’s portfolio, 
oversees the administration of all aspects of the Fund’s business and affairs, 
and pays the compensation of all Officers and Directors of the Fund who are 
affiliated persons of the Adviser. 
 
20 


The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Notes 
to Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
 
The Corporation pays each Director who is not considered an 
affiliated person an annual retainer of $18,000 plus $2,000 for each Board 
meeting attended, and they are reimbursed for any out of pocket expenses 
incurred in attending meetings. All Board committee members receive $1,000 per 
meeting attended. The Chairman of the Audit Committee receives a $3,000 annual 
fee, and the Lead Director receives an annual fee of $2,000. A Director may 
receive a single meeting fee, allocated among the participating funds, for 
attending certain meetings held on behalf of multiple funds. Directors who are 
directors or employees of the Adviser or an affiliated company receive no 
compensation or expense reimbursement from the Corporation. 
4. Distribution Plan. The Fund’s Board has adopted a 
distribution plan (the “Plan”) for each class of shares, except for Class I 
Shares, pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under 
the 1940 Act. Under the Class AAA, Class A, and Class C Share 
Plans, payments are authorized to G.distributors, LLC (the “Distributor”), an 
affiliate of the Adviser, at annual rates of 0.25%, 0.25%, and 1.00%, 
respectively, of the average daily net assets of those classes, the annual 
limitations under each Plan. Such payments are accrued daily and paid monthly. 

5. Portfolio Securities. Purchases and sales of securities 
during the year ended September 30, 2016, other than short term securities 
and U.S. Government obligations, aggregated $11,834,893 and $553,349,234 
respectively. 
6. Transactions with Affiliates and Other Arrangements. 
During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Fund paid $326,045 in 
brokerage commissions on security trades to G.research, LLC, an affiliate of the 
Adviser. Additionally, the Distributor retained a total of $174,416 from 
investors representing commissions (sales charges and underwriting fees) on 
sales and redemptions of Fund shares. 
During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Fund received 
credits from a designated broker who agreed to pay certain Fund operating 
expenses. The amount of such expenses paid through this directed brokerage 
arrangement during this period was $13,831. 
The cost of calculating the Fund’s NAV per share is a Fund expense 
pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. During the year ended September 30, 
2016, the Fund paid or accrued $45,000 to the Adviser in connection with the 
cost of computing the Fund’s NAV. 
During the year ended September 30, 2016, the Fund engaged in 
purchase and sale transactions with funds that have a common investment adviser. 
These purchase and sale transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amount to $625,000 
and $781,539, respectively. 
7. Line of Credit. The Fund participates in an unsecured 
line of credit, which expires on March 9, 2017 and may be renewed annually, 
of up to $75,000,000 under which it may borrow up to 10% of its net assets from 
the custodian for temporary borrowing purposes. Borrowings under this 
arrangement bears interest at a floating rate equal to the higher of the 
overnight Federal Funds rate plus 125 basis points or the 30 day LIBOR plus 125 
basis points in effect on that day. This amount, if any, would be included in 
“interest expense” in the Statement of Operations. At September 30, 2016, 
there was $53,838,000 outstanding under the line of credit. 
The average daily amount of borrowings outstanding under the line 
of credit during the year ended September 30, 2016 was $6,908,501 with a 
weighted average interest rate of 1.05%. The maximum amount borrowed at any time 
during the year ended September 30, 2016 was $62,131,000.

8. Capital Stock. The Fund offers four classes of shares – 
Class AAA Shares, Class A Shares, Class C Shares, and 
Class I Shares. Class AAA and Class I Shares are offered without 
a sales charge. Class A Shares are subject to a maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75%, and 
Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge for 
one year after purchase. 
The Fund imposes a redemption fee of 2.00% on all classes of 
shares that are redeemed or exchanged on or before the seventh day after the 
date of a purchase. The redemption fee is deducted from the proceeds otherwise 
payable to the redeeming shareholders and is retained by the Fund as an increase

The 
Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
Report 
of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 
 
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of 
The Gabelli Equity Income Fund 
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and 
liabilities of The Gabelli Equity Income Fund (the “Fund”), a series of Gabelli 
Equity Series Funds, Inc., including the schedule of investments, as of 
September 30, 2016, and the related statement of operations for the year 
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the two years in 
the period then ended and the financial highlights for each of the five years in 
the period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are 
the responsibility of the Fund’s management. Our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our 
audits. 
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material 
misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an audit of the Fund’s internal 
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an 
opinion on the effectiveness of the Fund’s internal control over financial 
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes 
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in 
the financial statements and financial highlights, assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. Our procedures included confirmation 
of securities owned as of September 30, 2016, by correspondence with the 
Fund’s custodian. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our 
opinion. 
In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights 
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of The Gabelli Equity Income Fund, a series of Gabelli Equity Series 
Funds, Inc., at September 30, 2016, the results of its operations for the 
year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the two years in the 
period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the five years in 
the period then ended in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting 
principles.
