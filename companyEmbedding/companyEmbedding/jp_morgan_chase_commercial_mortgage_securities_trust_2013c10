Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2013-C10 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms JPMCC 2013-C10
    





February 03, 2016 04:57 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 13 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMCC) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates series 2013-C10. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. The pool has performed as expected; there are no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans.
    

      As of the January 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 2.8% to $1.24 billion from $1.28 billion at 
      issuance. No loans are defeased. Per servicer reporting, there are three 
      loans (2.8%), on the watchlist, each of which have seen declines in 
      performance due to declining occupancy or rental rates. None of the 
      loans on the watchlist are in the transaction's top 20 loans.
    

      The largest loan in the pool (10.5% of the current balance) is secured 
      by The Shops at Riverside, a 771,233 square foot (sf) regional mall 
      located in Hackensack, NJ. Collateral for the loan totals 473,459 sf, 
      which includes 366,549 sf of in-line space. At origination, the mall was 
      anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue (collateral) and Bloomingdales 
      (non-collateral). Saks Fifth Avenue vacated the property upon its lease 
      expiration in January 2015. The master servicer has indicated the 
      borrower plans to redevelop this space, a portion of which will be 
      occupied by a movie theatre. As of September 2015, occupancy at the 
      property was 80%. The servicer reported a drop in the net operating 
      income (NOI) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) to 3.21x as of year-end 
      (YE) 2014 from 3.25x as of YE 2013. Fitch will continue to monitor the 
      redevelopment and lease up of the former Saks Fifth Avenue space.
    

      The second largest loan (9%) is secured by the Gateway Center, a four 
      building office complex totalling 1.5 million square feet in Pittsburgh, 
      PA. Per the September 2015 rent roll, occupancy was 90%, which is an 
      increase from 85% as of December 2014. The servicer reported an increase 
      in the NOI DSCR to 2.34x as of YE 2014 from 2.25x as of YE 2013.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      All classes maintain Stable Outlooks. Due to the recent issuance of the 
      transaction and stable performance, Fitch does not foresee positive or 
      negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset level 
      event materially changes the transaction's portfolio-level metrics.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes as indicated:
    

      --$27.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$87.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22.4 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$185 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$430.1 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$106.7 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$107.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$965.8 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$84.7 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$55.9 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$47.9 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$30.4 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$12.8 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      *Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate class X-B and the class NR certificates.

Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed  of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through , at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index covers the mortgage-backed pass-through securities of Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC). The performance of the Lipper U.S. Mortgage Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. CMOs are collateralized mortgage obligations, which are issued in multiple classes, and each class may have its own interest rate and/or final payment date. A class with an earlier final payment date may have certain preferences in receiving principal payments or earning interest. As a result, the value of some classes may be more volatile and may be subject to higher risk of nonpayment.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable.

	(1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases the most current DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The debt service coverage ratio information was provided to the Certificate Administrator by the Master Servicer and the Certificate Administrator has not independently confirmed the accuracy of such information.






	(2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if applicable, and the Maturity Date.






	(3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan information to the properties based upon the Cut-Off Date Balance of the related mortgage loan as disclosed in the offering document. The Scheduled Balance Totals reflect the aggregate balances of all pooled loans as reported in the CREFC Loan Periodic Update File. To the extent that the Scheduled Balance Total figure for the “State” and "Property” stratification tables is not equal to the sum of the scheduled balance figures for each state or property, the difference is explained by loans that have been modified into a split loan structure. The “State” and “Property” stratification tables do not include the balance of the subordinate note (sometimes called the B-piece or a “hope note”) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure. Rather, the scheduled balance for each state or property only reflects the balance of the senior note (sometimes called the A-piece) of a loan that has been modified into a split-loan structure.






	(4) All stratification tables include the Pooled and Non-Pooled Component balances.

John McCain, R-Ariz., joined two other Republican holdouts and all the Democrats to vote against the measure. McCain stunned several of his fellow Republican senators when he walked onto the Senate floor after midnight and appeared to inform Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that he couldn’t vote for the “skinny repeal” bill. Just a few days earlier, McCain flew back to the Capitol from Arizona after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer to cast the deciding vote to begin debating it.John McCain statement in full explaining why he killed Donald Trump's 'skinny' healthcare repeal billThe IndependentWatch: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'WKYC Cleveland9,042Reactions.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

John McCain, R-Ariz., joined two other Republican holdouts and all the Democrats to vote against the measure. McCain stunned several of his fellow Republican senators when he walked onto the Senate floor after midnight and appeared to inform Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that he couldn’t vote for the “skinny repeal” bill. Just a few days earlier, McCain flew back to the Capitol from Arizona after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer to cast the deciding vote to begin debating it.John McCain statement in full explaining why he killed Donald Trump's 'skinny' healthcare repeal billThe IndependentWatch: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'WKYC Cleveland9,042Reactions.
