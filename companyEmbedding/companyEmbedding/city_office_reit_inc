City Office REIT About To Put More Money In Your Pocket (CIO)
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 4/7/17, City Office REIT Inc will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.235, payable on 4/25/17. As a percentage of CIO's recent stock price of $12.17, this dividend works out to approximately 1.93%, so look for shares of City Office REIT Inc to trade 1.93% lower — all else being equal — when CIO shares open for trading on 4/7/17.

City Office REIT Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 7.84% Yield (CIO)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

Mar 30, 2017 11:02 AM EDT









City Office REIT is Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. City Office REIT Inc presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

City Office REIT Is Poised To Profit - City Office REIT, Inc. (NYSE:CIO) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»City Office REIT Is Poised To ProfitJun.20.16 | About: City Office (CIO) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryWe are adding a new company to our portfolio, and in this article, we will provide the research that resulted in our latest pick.We are adding CIO to our Small Cap REIT Portfolio, as we believe there is some alpha that can be generated.We model CIO to return 40% by the end of 2017.Sometimes good things come in small sizes, but they don't always stick out like a sore thumb. I wish it was easy, but the facts are clear, you have to work hard to find the real gems. It should be no surprise, then, that when the REIT market rallies, it's led by the institutional buyers that have a much higher degree of analyst coverage and much lower risk tolerances. Alternatively, small-cap REITs have always been seen as riskier bets than large caps. In my newsletter (Forbes Real Estate Investor), we own a number of small cap REITs, and we have been pleased with the year-to-date performance that has returned 9.4%. Our top five small-cap REITs have returned over 24% year to date, and our #1 small cap is Preferred Apartment Communities(NYSEMKT:APTS) - up 43.5% year to date. We also had some pain in our Small Cap REIT portfolio. New Senior (NYSE:SNR) returned -25.1% (see article here), and Chatham Lodging (NYSE:CLDT) returned -18.16% year to date. We still see value in these companies, and hopefully, they will be our top performers in 2016. It stands to reason; small caps are more susceptible to wide swings in price due to lower trading volumes. This greater volatility deters action and often invites selling. This lack of visibility means unexpected news about a small cap can cause a spike in its share price. In addition, when mutual funds and other large investors buy or sell many shares at once, it can cause volatility in a stock with a small market cap. But these apparent drawbacks have little effect on returns for long-term holders. We are adding a new company to our portfolio, and in this article, we will provide the research that resulted in our latest pick, City Office REIT Is Poised To Profit.
 City Office REIT City Office REIT (NYSE:CIO) is a newly organized Maryland corporation formed on November 26, 2013 to acquire, own, and operate high-quality office properties located within its specified markets in the United States. Based in Vancouver, Canada, CIO listed on the NYSE on April 11, 2014 (over two years ago) by raising $189 million at a price of $15.00 per share. It is the smallest office REIT in our research lab (see the last ticker on the left below). 

 CIO owns 14 properties (3.3 million square feet) located in growing markets with strong fundamentals. The buildings are located in Seattle, Portland, Boise, Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Denver, Dallas, San Antonio, Austin, Houston, Tampa, and Orlando. 

 To be clear, CIO is very small - all of the properties owned by the REIT generate annual NOI of just $37.6 million. The company focuses on assets valued at $20-50 million with targeted cap rates of 7-8%. 

 We have not been a big fan of traditional office REITs, as we have favored more stable medical office building REITs like Healthcare Trust of America (NYSE:HTA) and Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC). However, we do like the favorable job growth that will ultimately lead to better credit quality and attractive rent growth.
 

 Population growth is the real driver, and as illustrated below, CIO is focused on markets with strong economic fundamentals and demographics. 

 Here is a snapshot of the current portfolio. Note, the in-place occupancy is 93.2% and the weighted average gross rental rate per square foot is $21.50. 

 Around 49.2% of the REIT's portfolio revenue is generated from government agencies, investment-grade companies or their subsidiaries. The largest tenant is the State of Colorado that generates 10.2% of CIO's Annual Base Rent (or ABR). 

 Since The IPO Since it went public (in April 2014), the company has increased square footage by over 1.4 million square feet. Also, FFO has increased by $.10 per share (from $.22 to $.32), while decreasing the core FFO payout ratio from 84.5% to 73.8%. 


 In September 2015, CIO acquired 190 Office Center in Dallas, TX. This 302,829-square foot building is 98% leased and was acquired at a year-one cap rate of 7.5%. 

 In September 2015, CIO acquired Intellicenter in Tampa, FL. This 203,509-square foot building is 100% leased, and it was acquired at a 7.3% cap rate. 

 In February 2016, the company internalized management by acquiring the External Advisor for 297,321 shares of CIO stock plus $3.5 million. This provides enhanced alignment with investors and creates fewer conflicts of interest. 

 The Balance Sheet From a liquidity standpoint, CIO closed on a $91.8 million equity raise on April 5th. At quarter end (prior to the equity raise), the company had cash of approximately $8.2 million and approximately $21 million remaining undrawn and authorized under its current $75 million credit facility. CIO also had $14.8 million of restricted cash available to fund future TIs, LCs, and capital projects. CIO's total debt net of deferred financing costs was $345.1 million, or $338.1 million when deducting the non-controlling interest share of certain debts. The company's net debt-to-enterprise value was 47% as of Q1-16.
 

 The net proceeds from the follow-on offering were used to pay down all of the floating rate debt and contributed approximately $18.7 million to the cash balance. CIO said it expects to acquire between $140 million and $160 million over the coming quarters. The company has no debt maturities in 2016 and 2017. The conservative debt structure (100% fixed rate) has an average debt maturity of 6.4 years with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. 

 Also, it has stable, long-term lease contracts (5.5-year weighted average remaining lease term) with well-staggered leases. 

 The Earnings Wrap As CIO communicated on the last few calls, the first half of 2016 will be a transitional period. 181,000 square feet of space is under construction for St. Luke's and Kaiser Foundation at CIO's Washington Group Plaza and AmberGlen properties. No rent was received from these tenants during the first quarter while their space was being completed. Despite the rent drag, the REIT maintained strong core FFO of $0.32 for the quarter, which was slightly ahead of expectations. Also, excluding the two properties, CIO's same-store net operating income from other properties grew an impressive 3.6% over the prior quarter.
 

 CIO's first-quarter AFFO was $3.6 million, or $0.22 per share. AFFO was negatively affected by the straight-line rent adjustments of $1.1 million, of which the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation lease at Corporate Parkway and the United Healthcare lease at 190 Center represents $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, due to anticipated free rent periods that were disclosed on the company's guidance on the last earnings call. These amounts will continue into Q2-16, and by Q4-16, the straight-line rent adjustments will return to lower levels. We point this out primarily because we want to explain the dividend safety and payout ratio for FFO and AFFO. 

 CIO has paid $.235 per share in dividends since going public in April 2014: 

 In 2015, CIO's AFFO Payout Ratio was 98%, and in Q1-16, we can see that the Payout Ratio is now above 100%. As noted above, the company attributed that to straight-line rent reporting, and also, as mentioned, CIO has several new large leases coming on-line in Q2 and Q3. The Q1-16 FFO Payout Ratio is 74%, much lower than the FFO Payout in most of 2015 (around 90%). Initiating a BUY (Beware, It's a Small Cap)
 As noted above, we are adding CIO to our Small Cap REIT Portfolio, as we believe there is some alpha that can be generated. However, we must reiterate that this company is tiny and shares could move up or down as the wind blows. Although we have a limited history to rely on, we like the robust growth profile ($250 million in acquisitions since IPO) and the fact that management and directors own 17.2% (as of Q1-16). Here's how the company has performed since the IPO: 

 Here's how CIO can be valued based on the current dividend yield: 

 Here's how CIO is valued based on P/FFO multiples: 

 To Sum It All Up City Office REIT is cheap. Yes, bargains are sometimes inexpensive because they have no shelf space. It appears there are just three analysts covering the company (four if you count us), but we believe there are other catalysts besides lack of Wall Street coverage. From a macro prospective, we believe job growth and population growth support more demand for high-quality office space. As CIO continues to grow, we believe the diversification will enhance the safety of the dividend and the company will be able to generate dividend growth. The quality of CIO's revenue appears strong, and we like the fact that management has internalized operations, further suggesting an alignment of interest.
 We model CIO to return 40% by the end of 2017. Although we would like to see our Small Cap REIT Portfolio produce similar results, we must maintain adequate diversification, and thus, our initial investment in CIO will be of modest proportions. Forbes Real Estate Investor subscribers will see the new company added in the July edition as well as the full YTD results.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Sector Rank assigns a rating to each of the 16 Sectors based on their average Zacks Rank.
A sector with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.

The sector with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top sector (1 out of 16), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Sectors. The sector with the worst average Zacks Rank (16 out of 16) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
