TPEG partnered with S2 Capital LLC for the purpose of acquiring the Camelot Village apartment community in Mesquite, Texas. Camelot Village is a 512-unit, garden-style multifamily community that was constructed in 1983. TPEG and S2 Capital were attracted to this project because it represented an opportunity to acquire a well-located property at an attractive price per door. Camelot Village also had assumable debt in place on favorable terms. S2 and TPEG believe that renovations, mostly to unit interiors, will allow for rent increases that will significantly increase the property’s value. TPEG provided nearly $10m in preferred equity and mezzanine debt.
In December 2016, 18 months after acquisition, Forty200 was refinanced. The refinance returned all invested capital to investors, paid all preferred return, and provided additional profit to investors. Following the refinance, TPEG investors had received distributions equivalent to 129% of their original investment. Those investors continue to own 50% of the property and will participate in all future distributions.

Sold in March 2012 after 25 months, this drugstore in Ruston, LA was backed by the A+ rated credit of Walgreens. TPEG provided $1.1m in preferred equity and subordinated debt. TPEG reduced risk by hedging the floating interest rate, which lowered TPEG investors' final pre-tax IRR from 30% to 14% but eliminated a substantial perceived risk. Current yield for the life of the preferred equity was 9.2% and the cash-on-cash return to TPEG investors was 129%, with the hedge. The subordinated debt paid 8%.
