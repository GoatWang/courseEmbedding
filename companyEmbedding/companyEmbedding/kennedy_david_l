                BLOOMBERG NEWS            






Cosmetics company Revlon Inc. said Chief Executive Alan Ennis is leaving the company to pursue other interests.
The New York-based company has named former CEO and current Vice Chairman David L. Kennedy as interim CEO, effective immediately.

BLOOMBERG NEWS






 


"I've greatly enjoyed my tenure at Revlon, and I am proud of the results we have delivered,” Ennis, who has been CEO since May 2009, said in a statement. “However, I have come to the decision that it is best for me at this time to pursue other interests."
Kennedy, 66, was a senior executive of Revlon (NYSE: REV) from 2002 to 2009, including serving as chief financial officer in 2006 before being becoming president and CEO from 2006 to 2009. Kennedy resigned in May 2009 and became vice chairman, as well as assuming other senior executive roles with MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings and Scientific Games Corp.
Kennedy's career also includes senior management and senior financial positions with The Coca-Cola Co. and its affiliates, Columbia Pictures, and Ernst & Young.
Revlon, which said it plans to name a permanent CEO soon, has been battling declining revenue. The company in late July said second-quarter sales fell 2 percent to $350.1 million, with flat sales growth in the United States and sales dropping in the rest of the world.
In August, Revlon said it planned to buy beauty salon products company Colomer Group for $660 million. The company said that deal is expect to close later this month.




 


“We believe David is the perfect choice to guide the company in the interim period through its integration of The Colomer Group, including the Revlon Professional business, and the significant growth and profit opportunities presented by this acquisition,” Chairman Ronald Perelman said.
Revlon’s products include Revlon, Almay, Sinful Colors, Pure Ice cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk hair color; Revlon beauty tools; Charlie fragrances; Mitchum anti-perspirant deodorants; and Ultima II and Gatineau skincare products.

Q&A with David Kennedy, author of “Eat Your Greens”

Share Article
















Dave Kennedy is the founder and director of Leaf for Life, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the elimination of global malnutrition through the optimum use of leaf crops to support human health. He has designed and implemented projects and workshops involving small-scale agriculture and innovative food processing in 13 different countries on four continents. The author of 21st Century Greens and the Leaf for Life Handbook, David is a tireless advocate for the development of wholesome food systems worldwide.  In his latest book, Eat Your Greens, Kennedy demonstrates the surprising power of homegrown leaf crops.  Read on to learn more enter to win one of two copies from New Society Publishing!


1. How did you become an advocate for leaf crops?
When I began gardening many years ago I was fascinated with the idea of growing all the food I needed. As I studied the subject it became obvious that leaf crops could produce more of the essential nutrients in less space and in less time than other food crops or livestock. Curiosity led me to get a masters degree focusing on food systems and to begin working on building more equitable and durable food systems.
2. Why is it important that we embark on a re-envisioned home vegetable garden movement which has a greater focus on leafy vegetables? What are the advantages?
I think the home vegetable garden has the potential to address two of our biggest food system problems; lack of diversity and low nutrient density. We derive something like 75% of our calories from just four plant species corn, rice, wheat and soybeans. There are over 1000 species of plants with edible leaves. Greater variety builds greater resiliency at all levels of eco-systems, including our food eco-systems.
Calorie rich, nutrient poor foods like soda, candy and chips force us to consume more calories than we need in order to obtain the required micro-nutrients. This is a primary cause of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
3. How does your book help us take leafy vegetables to the next level?
Eat Your Greens was written to encourage people to explore the possibilities of home gardens. I wanted to share my passion for growing leaf crops in a way that was practical and non-technical but that provided a bit more depth on the subject than most popular gardening books.
4. When it comes to leafy vegetables, most of our thoughts likely turn to lettuce and other more traditional choices but the fact remains that there is quite a diverse catalog to choose from. Just how many species of plants have edible leaves and are there any plants that you would highly recommend for the adventurous gardeners among us and why?
There are over a thousand plant species with edible leaves. In helping people choose which ones to grow I lean towards perennials, high nutritional value, ease of growing, and plants with multiple uses.Flavor is obviously very important as well, but I would suggest that this is not an absolute. The North American palate is actually evolving quite rapidly and we are beginning to embrace foods like kale, arugula and kimchi that have more complex flavors than those offered by macaroni and cheese and iceberg lettuce. There is a good argument to be made for learning to enjoy some plant foods that are nutritious and easy to grow rather than insisting on growing plants that we already enjoy eating even though they may be not be well-adapted to our climate or especially useful to our bodies.
Perennial leaf crops such as chaya, moringa, goji, garlic chives, Pacific hibiscus, Okinawan spinach, and longevity spinach are good choices in many gardens. Perennials don’t need to be replanted from new seed every year. That saves money and it reduces soil disturbance. They can all be easily propagated and shared with friends at no cost. Perennial vegetable crops are also better at capturing carbon from the air and adding it to the soil where it feeds beneficial microbes.
If you have a little extra space in your garden I recommend experimenting with several new leaf crops to see what grows well where you are and what tastes good to you. The Internet is making it much easier to track down seeds and cuttings to start unusual garden plants.
5. In your book you mention the importance of seeing plants in their entirety. What crops would our readers be surprised to know are actually multi-use?
This may be a bit of a round about answer, but I like to think of home gardens as intimate eco-systems that we manage in a way that is beneficial to us. A key to this approach is learning more about the lives of the plants we are growing. As we learn a bit of botany we start to see leaves as the dynamic engines of growth, stems as supports and transport systems, roots as anchors and gatherers of nutrients and water. In this view most of the fruits, seeds, and tubers that are familiar vegetables are where food created in the leaves is stored.  Food created in leaves can often be intercepted at various point in the plants growth. Though they are primarily grown primarily for their fruits, and roots, and seeds the leaves of pumpkins, okra, sweet potatoes, grapes, beans, peas, wheat, and many other common food crops are edible and nutritious. Usually they are more nutritionally dense than the primary product.
Probably the most important category of multi-use garden plants are edible cover crops such as black-eyed peas, barley, and cowhorn  turnips that can improve the soil while providing nutritious leafy vegetables.
6. Your book not only discusses the growing of leafy greens but also in how to prepare them in the kitchen with a section of recipes. What is one of your favorite recipes from the book?

There are a lot of good ways to prepare mild flavored greens like spinach. I am especially interested in recipes that encourage us to eat meaningful amounts of some of the nutritionally impressive but stronger flavored and tougher textured greens. One that we eat often at home is pasta  made with 20% dried moringa leaf powder. We make up big batches of five pounds of so of dried pasta and pack it in meal sized bags. It offers the convenience of Ramen noodles with a lot more nutritional punch.
For milder flavored greens I like Malabar bars. They are pretty delicious for a snack food that is good for you.

Q&A with David Kennedy, author of “Eat Your Greens”

Share Article
















Dave Kennedy is the founder and director of Leaf for Life, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the elimination of global malnutrition through the optimum use of leaf crops to support human health. He has designed and implemented projects and workshops involving small-scale agriculture and innovative food processing in 13 different countries on four continents. The author of 21st Century Greens and the Leaf for Life Handbook, David is a tireless advocate for the development of wholesome food systems worldwide.  In his latest book, Eat Your Greens, Kennedy demonstrates the surprising power of homegrown leaf crops.  Read on to learn more enter to win one of two copies from New Society Publishing!


1. How did you become an advocate for leaf crops?
When I began gardening many years ago I was fascinated with the idea of growing all the food I needed. As I studied the subject it became obvious that leaf crops could produce more of the essential nutrients in less space and in less time than other food crops or livestock. Curiosity led me to get a masters degree focusing on food systems and to begin working on building more equitable and durable food systems.
2. Why is it important that we embark on a re-envisioned home vegetable garden movement which has a greater focus on leafy vegetables? What are the advantages?
I think the home vegetable garden has the potential to address two of our biggest food system problems; lack of diversity and low nutrient density. We derive something like 75% of our calories from just four plant species corn, rice, wheat and soybeans. There are over 1000 species of plants with edible leaves. Greater variety builds greater resiliency at all levels of eco-systems, including our food eco-systems.
Calorie rich, nutrient poor foods like soda, candy and chips force us to consume more calories than we need in order to obtain the required micro-nutrients. This is a primary cause of the global epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
3. How does your book help us take leafy vegetables to the next level?
Eat Your Greens was written to encourage people to explore the possibilities of home gardens. I wanted to share my passion for growing leaf crops in a way that was practical and non-technical but that provided a bit more depth on the subject than most popular gardening books.
4. When it comes to leafy vegetables, most of our thoughts likely turn to lettuce and other more traditional choices but the fact remains that there is quite a diverse catalog to choose from. Just how many species of plants have edible leaves and are there any plants that you would highly recommend for the adventurous gardeners among us and why?
There are over a thousand plant species with edible leaves. In helping people choose which ones to grow I lean towards perennials, high nutritional value, ease of growing, and plants with multiple uses.Flavor is obviously very important as well, but I would suggest that this is not an absolute. The North American palate is actually evolving quite rapidly and we are beginning to embrace foods like kale, arugula and kimchi that have more complex flavors than those offered by macaroni and cheese and iceberg lettuce. There is a good argument to be made for learning to enjoy some plant foods that are nutritious and easy to grow rather than insisting on growing plants that we already enjoy eating even though they may be not be well-adapted to our climate or especially useful to our bodies.
Perennial leaf crops such as chaya, moringa, goji, garlic chives, Pacific hibiscus, Okinawan spinach, and longevity spinach are good choices in many gardens. Perennials don’t need to be replanted from new seed every year. That saves money and it reduces soil disturbance. They can all be easily propagated and shared with friends at no cost. Perennial vegetable crops are also better at capturing carbon from the air and adding it to the soil where it feeds beneficial microbes.
If you have a little extra space in your garden I recommend experimenting with several new leaf crops to see what grows well where you are and what tastes good to you. The Internet is making it much easier to track down seeds and cuttings to start unusual garden plants.
5. In your book you mention the importance of seeing plants in their entirety. What crops would our readers be surprised to know are actually multi-use?
This may be a bit of a round about answer, but I like to think of home gardens as intimate eco-systems that we manage in a way that is beneficial to us. A key to this approach is learning more about the lives of the plants we are growing. As we learn a bit of botany we start to see leaves as the dynamic engines of growth, stems as supports and transport systems, roots as anchors and gatherers of nutrients and water. In this view most of the fruits, seeds, and tubers that are familiar vegetables are where food created in the leaves is stored.  Food created in leaves can often be intercepted at various point in the plants growth. Though they are primarily grown primarily for their fruits, and roots, and seeds the leaves of pumpkins, okra, sweet potatoes, grapes, beans, peas, wheat, and many other common food crops are edible and nutritious. Usually they are more nutritionally dense than the primary product.
Probably the most important category of multi-use garden plants are edible cover crops such as black-eyed peas, barley, and cowhorn  turnips that can improve the soil while providing nutritious leafy vegetables.
6. Your book not only discusses the growing of leafy greens but also in how to prepare them in the kitchen with a section of recipes. What is one of your favorite recipes from the book?

There are a lot of good ways to prepare mild flavored greens like spinach. I am especially interested in recipes that encourage us to eat meaningful amounts of some of the nutritionally impressive but stronger flavored and tougher textured greens. One that we eat often at home is pasta  made with 20% dried moringa leaf powder. We make up big batches of five pounds of so of dried pasta and pack it in meal sized bags. It offers the convenience of Ramen noodles with a lot more nutritional punch.

On Saturday night, three days before he died, David Kennedy asked Robert Driscoll to paint a flower for him. A longtime friend of the Kennedy family, Driscoll, 75, exhibits his paintings at the Brazilian Court, the elegant Palm Beach hotel where David was spending Easter. Accompanied by a date, chestnut-haired Leslie Griffin, 24, of Greenwich, Conn., Kennedy spotted the artist wandering among the palms and orange trees on the grounds and asked him to paint a red anemone. “David asked for it because it is a very sexy flower,” says Driscoll. “The girl showed an interest in having the painting, but I told David he must keep it for himself. He thanked me and agreed. It became his farewell, his last request.”
For Driscoll, that is a fond memory, one that illuminates the softer side of a sensitive young man whom he loved as “a kindred spirit.” It was not, however, a scene typical of this tormented young Kennedy’s final days.
David had arrived in Palm Beach two days earlier, on April 19, fresh from a stay in a drug program at St. Mary’s Rehabilitation Center in St. Paul, Minn. There was no room for him and some other family members at the mansion of his ailing grandmother, Rose, 93, but along with the rest of the Kennedy clan, he made dutiful daily visits there. The rest of his days and nights were spent in a relentless pursuit of oblivion. He started drinking in the morning, double vodkas (often three at a time) smuggled into the perpetual dusk of his curtained room even before the hotel bar opened at 11. In the afternoons he lounged around the hotel pool. At night he hit the local bars, sometimes with relatives and friends, sometimes alone. “He could really slam ’em back, double vodkas on the rocks,” recalls Shaun Donnelly, the bartender at Doherty’s, a preppy piano bar. “He’d drink that much and it didn’t show.”
Donnelly saw Kennedy during the afternoon; at night the drink sometimes did show. “He looked a mess,” says Kim Waldron, a cocktail waitress in the same bar. She didn’t recognize the haggard, unshaven young man until he paid for his drinks with an American Express card bearing the name Mrs. Robert Kennedy. David threw Waldron a lame line—he said he was new in town and asked her to show him around—but she declined. “I didn’t want to be seen with anybody who looked like that,” she says. A member of the Brazilian Court staff says David appeared sickly: “He had an old body for such a young man.” On Sunday, the day after painting the flower, Driscoll saw David at a splash party co-hosted by Leslie around a pear-shape pool on a nearby estate. “By that time David had begun to look pretty bad,” he says. “He was out of it, taking Demerol and drinking a lot of vodka. He had been on methadone. He was the wrong person to be drinking.”
He certainly was. David Anthony Kennedy, in his short 28 years of life, already had caused himself more than enough trouble with drink and drugs. Once he’d been mugged in a sleazy Harlem hotel known as a drug supermarket and “shooting gallery.” Twice he’d been arrested for drunk driving. At least five times he had been in and out of drug treatment programs. Although he wasn’t the only Kennedy boy to use drugs, David had long been identified as the problem child, the one in constant crisis. “David died of despair,” says a Kennedy friend in Boston. “He really did believe that everyone in the family regarded him as merely a skeleton to be kept closeted.”
Even before tragedy blasted his family, David was a dreamy introvert in a crowd of outgoing, boisterous competitors. His father, Robert Kennedy—like David, the scrawny, shy third son in a large family—understood him best. He took pains to nurture the boy, to bring him to his Senate office on Saturdays, to make sure that the frail tow-head saw his share of action in the family’s trademark touch-football games. On June 4, 1968, while California Democrats cast their votes in their presidential primary, Bobby took David for a swim at Malibu. The ocean, not particularly pacific that day, snatched the scared 12-year-old from the surf and dragged him out into the deep water. Bobby Kennedy swam after the boy, clutching him to his chest and carrying him back to shore. It was the last service Bobby performed for David. That night, alone for hours in a hotel room and overlooked in the commotion, David stared at the live television coverage of his father’s assassination. He didn’t speak for days afterward. The magnitude of his loss is hinted at in the touching tribute he wrote six months later as a Christmas surprise for his mother: “Daddy was very funny in church because he would embarrass all of us by singing very loud. Daddy did not have a very good voice. There will be no more football with Daddy, no more sailing with him, no more riding and no more camping with him. But he was the best father their [sic] ever was and I would rather have had him for a father for the length of time I did than any other father for a million years.”
His father’s death seemed to end any sense of order or direction in David’s life. That summer his mother sent him to Austria, where he had his first sexual encounter; it was with a 17-year-old girl who in the process mumbled something about feeling sorry about his father. Later that year his older brother Bobby gave him a tab of mescaline. At 15, David hitchhiked with his cousin Chris Lawford to New York, where they panhandled in Grand Central Station and with the money bought heroin in Central Park for the first time. By then David was a dedicated doper, starting his days at Middlesex Academy in Concord, Mass. with a morning joint and tripping on acid frequently. The drug use increased after David severely injured his back, and his girlfriend Pam Kelley was paralyzed, in his brother Joe’s jeep accident on Cape Cod. In the hospital David received morphine to relieve the pain in his back; upon his release he began experimenting with heroin to ease his psychic anguish.
Ethel Kennedy tried various strategies to set her son straight. During one summer vacation she sent him to work with labor organizer Cesar Chavez in the lettuce fields in California. During another, she dispatched him to do manual labor on a ranch in Colorado.
But his problems were not so easily remedied by being thrust out on his own. Unlike his brothers, David confronted his mother with his pain. Over Christmas at Aspen, one friend recalls, David, an expert skier, would lie on the couch in his mother’s house all day and have his food brought to him by a maid. Whenever he tried to bring up his father’s death, Ethel would cut him off. “No one ever talked to me about what I was feeling,” David told Peter Collier and David Horowitz, authors of the forthcoming book The Kennedys: An American Drama, to be published in June by Summit Books. “Nobody ever talked to me about my father’s death. To this day, in fact, my mother has never talked to me about it.”
In the fall of 1974 David arrived at Harvard. “He was incredibly emaciated and white faced,” a classmate remembers. “He was walking death.” He lasted two years, then dropped out and headed for New York, where he frequently made the gossip columns squiring attractive women (including actress Rachel Ward) to trendy discos. “It was tons of fun,” says a pal who went along for the ride. “David was a real gentleman. He really cared about his friends and treated them well.” But his close friends were worried. “He’d come home so completely out of it, you’d have to watch him really carefully,” says one intimate. “You never knew if he would do something like drop a lighted cigarette and set the place on fire. Everyone around him was completely scared. They were all keeping tabs on him, calling him, calling other people, to check where he was and who he was with.” This friend remembers crashing one night in David’s apartment and waking to the sound of sobbing. “I asked him if he wanted to talk,” he says. “He didn’t.”
In September 1979 David was beaten and robbed in a Harlem hotel that catered to the dope trade. A week later he was hospitalized with bacterial endocarditis, a disease frequently associated with drug abuse. Friends say he nearly died. The Kennedy family dispatched him to a series of drug-treatment programs. Finally in February 1980 the family hired Sacramento, Calif. detoxer Donald Juhl, 41, whose clients have included the late Beach Boy Dennis Wilson, actor Jan-Michael Vincent and, reportedly, David’s brother Bobby Jr., after his South Dakota arrest for heroin possession last year. Juhl is said to have treated the wayward David in Hyannis Port and then taken him to Sacramento in February 1980. David told a friend that Juhl’s treatment cost $100,000, which he said came out of his trust fund. Five months later he was arrested for drunken driving, an offense he repeated in Sacramento within two years. Patrick Powers, a Sacramento advertising consultant and Kennedy acquaintance, watched David hit the bars and drift into more dangerous pursuits. “I saw him party and I saw him get stoned,” he says. “He never really got off it.”
In June 1980 David met hairstylist Nancie Alexander, 35, through associates of his drug counselor. Although they shared few interests—she is a fundamentalist Christian and a conservative Republican—their platonic friendship thrived, and David found he could confide in the motherly Nancie. “I said to him, ‘Do you think people expect more of you because of who you are?’ He said people should expect more. ‘I have everything they want and they don’t understand why I don’t use it to the fullest,’ ” she recalls. “He wanted his mother’s respect. He wanted to grow up and he wanted to be well.” At one point, Nancie says, David became an Amway distributor and enthusiastically “believed he could become a millionaire.” Another time he worked as a laborer for a cement firm. “If you were around David for any time, it would make you cry,” Nancie says. “He was so lost. He was bent on going down a one-way street the wrong way.”
In 1981 he went home for Christmas and brought back to Sacramento a new girlfriend—free-lance photographer Paula Sculley. They moved in together and remained close until his death. “When Paula came into his life, they were inseparable,” says Alexander. “She accepted him 100 percent and she took care of him. Paula wasn’t into drugs.”
David left Sacramento in the fall of 1982, telling friends there that he planned to return to Harvard, then go to law school or into journalism. He occasionally hung out his Kennedy-bred ambitions like tattered banners. “We used to drive by the Justice Department and David would say, ‘I’m gonna be up there one day, I’m gonna be Attorney General,’ ” says a Washington friend, remembering David’s desire to emulate his father. To be readmitted to Harvard, David took a six-month job at the Atlantic Monthly. He worked as a glorified clerk and gofer, but even that menial job sometimes seemed too much for him, and co-workers found him unable to concentrate or even to remain awake. But he held on and then entered Harvard, completing a summer and a fall semester before he dropped out again. On March 19 he checked into St. Mary’s Rehabilitation Center under the name of David Kilroy. He seemed merely to be going through the motions. “It was pretty obvious that he was resisting,” said one staff member. “He was in his own world. He was brought up to hide his feelings. And he was scared to death.”
On Thursday, April 19, after 28 days at a daily fee of $149, David left St. Mary’s and flew to Palm Beach. He checked into a $292-a-night two-room suite at the Brazilian Court, near his younger brother Douglas, 17, who was with a friend from Georgetown Prep. When Douglas was around, David drank soda or Perrier, the hotel staff noticed. But when Douglas left him alone, David guzzled vodka. That ruse did not fool his family. By Tuesday morning concerned family members were calling his room, only to find the phone busy for hours. They requested that someone check up on him. At 1 p.m. bell captain Doug Moschiano went to his room, ignored the “Do Not Disturb” sign and knocked. There was no answer. He unlocked the door and peeked in. David was in bed, asleep, with the phone off the hook. That afternoon David took a cab to visit his grandmother and returned to the hotel around 9. The next morning his mother, worried that he was not back in Boston, phoned the front desk. Again Moschiano checked the room, this time accompanied by hotel secretary Betty Barnett. “Douglas and I were standing outside David’s door when I had the most ominous feeling,” she says. “Call it a mother’s gut instinct or whatever, but I knew what we would find.”
They knocked, heard no answer, then entered. David was lying on the floor, between twin beds that hadn’t been slept in, wearing beige shorts, a preppy pink shirt, brown socks and off-white Top-Siders. A packed green duffle bag was on one bed, a dollar bill on the other. “I touched his face,” says Barnett, “and there was no doubt about it. He was dead.” Paramedics, on a training mission nearby, arrived only a minute later. There was nothing they could do. Police found a prescription pill bottle and 1.3 grams of high-quality cocaine in the room. The autopsy results revealed cocaine and Demerol in his bloodstream.
A few days later David’s friend Robert Driscoll, the artist, speculated about David’s last hours. “He had driven his brother Doug and his friend to the airport on Monday,” he said. “He was left alone. He was depressed and letdown after a party-filled five days. He went to his room alone to go to bed early. Then he pumped himself up…” Driscoll paused, then spoke slowly. “I’ll miss David. All the others are tough. They are different soil than David. They handled their father’s death. But it hit David harder. He suffered too much.” It was a suffering no one could help him with. He succumbed to it alone.

History[edit]
Dan Wieden met David Kennedy in 1980, at the William Cain advertising agency while working on the Nike account. They took Nike with them as a client after founding Wieden & Kennedy (later changed to Wieden+Kennedy) on April 1, 1982, and remain the agency of record.[4] The agency's first advertisements were three television commercials for Nike that were aired during the New York City Marathon in October 1982.[5]
Over the years, the agency has added offices in New York City, London, Amsterdam, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Delhi and in late 2010, São Paulo. W+K's turbulent relationship with former client Subaru is the basis of Randall Rothenberg's 1995 book Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign.[6]
Media[edit]
Main article: WKE (WKEntertainment)
Wieden+Kennedy has created original content for various brands under the moniker W+K Entertainment since 2001. Its productions include Battlegrounds,[7] an MTV2 series showcasing streetball;[8] Ginga,[9] a documentary about Brazilian football (soccer) players; and Road to Paris,[10] documenting Lance Armstrong's path to his third Tour de France victory in 2001.
In 2003, Wieden+Kennedy created W+K Tokyo Lab, a record label and creative workshop based out of the agency's Tokyo office. Since 2003, W+K Tokyo Lab has released CD/DVD titles that combine music, graphics, and film. Tokyo Lab's current roster features local hip-hop and electronic artists including Hifana, DJ Uppercut, Afra, and Takagi Masakatsu.
2004 saw the launch of "Wieden+Kennedy 12", a 13-month experimental advertising program that accepts 13 applicants each year for an intensive laboratory experience where students work for real clients under the direction of members of the W+K Portland office.
In 2006, Wieden+Kennedy debuted an afternoon showcase of established and emerging musical artists in the atrium of W+K's Portland office, dubbed the "LunchBox" concert series. Past concerts have featured Janelle Monáe, Art Brut, The Rapture, Son Volt, Lyrics Born, Ladytron, Cut Chemist, Cold War Kids, Nada Surf, Juliette and the Licks, Pete Yorn and Snax.
Wieden+Kennedy's exploration into original programming was started in late 2008 with WK Radio,[11] and subsequently in Fall 2009 with WKEntertainment.
Awards[edit]
Two of the agency's television ads for Nike have won Emmy Awards: "The Morning After," which featured a runner on New Year's Day in 2000, not noticing that every dire Y2K prediction has come to pass; and "Move," which edited seamlessly dozens of athletes and children moving from one sport or activity to another.

History[edit]
Dan Wieden met David Kennedy in 1980, at the William Cain advertising agency while working on the Nike account. They took Nike with them as a client after founding Wieden & Kennedy (later changed to Wieden+Kennedy) on April 1, 1982, and remain the agency of record.[4] The agency's first advertisements were three television commercials for Nike that were aired during the New York City Marathon in October 1982.[5]
Over the years, the agency has added offices in New York City, London, Amsterdam, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Delhi and in late 2010, São Paulo. W+K's turbulent relationship with former client Subaru is the basis of Randall Rothenberg's 1995 book Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign.[6]
Media[edit]
Main article: WKE (WKEntertainment)
Wieden+Kennedy has created original content for various brands under the moniker W+K Entertainment since 2001. Its productions include Battlegrounds,[7] an MTV2 series showcasing streetball;[8] Ginga,[9] a documentary about Brazilian football (soccer) players; and Road to Paris,[10] documenting Lance Armstrong's path to his third Tour de France victory in 2001.
In 2003, Wieden+Kennedy created W+K Tokyo Lab, a record label and creative workshop based out of the agency's Tokyo office. Since 2003, W+K Tokyo Lab has released CD/DVD titles that combine music, graphics, and film. Tokyo Lab's current roster features local hip-hop and electronic artists including Hifana, DJ Uppercut, Afra, and Takagi Masakatsu.
2004 saw the launch of "Wieden+Kennedy 12", a 13-month experimental advertising program that accepts 13 applicants each year for an intensive laboratory experience where students work for real clients under the direction of members of the W+K Portland office.
In 2006, Wieden+Kennedy debuted an afternoon showcase of established and emerging musical artists in the atrium of W+K's Portland office, dubbed the "LunchBox" concert series. Past concerts have featured Janelle Monáe, Art Brut, The Rapture, Son Volt, Lyrics Born, Ladytron, Cut Chemist, Cold War Kids, Nada Surf, Juliette and the Licks, Pete Yorn and Snax.
Wieden+Kennedy's exploration into original programming was started in late 2008 with WK Radio,[11] and subsequently in Fall 2009 with WKEntertainment.
Awards[edit]
Two of the agency's television ads for Nike have won Emmy Awards: "The Morning After," which featured a runner on New Year's Day in 2000, not noticing that every dire Y2K prediction has come to pass; and "Move," which edited seamlessly dozens of athletes and children moving from one sport or activity to another. The Morning After aired in late 1999 and won the Emmy in 2000; Move aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics and won the Emmy that year.
In 2002, the Gunn Report named W+K as the most-awarded agency in the world,[12] and the agency was AdWeek's "Global Agency of the Year" in 2007.[13]
"It's Mine", Wieden+Kennedy's advertisement for Coca-Cola which aired during Super Bowl XLII in 2008, was named as the best Super Bowl commercial of the decade by Adweek magazine.[14] The magazine also picked W+K's "Grrr" for Honda as the overall commercial of the decade.[14] Meanwhile, Bob Garfield of AdAge added Wieden+Kennedy's "Go Forth" for Levi's as one of the worst ads in 2009.[14]

Wieden+Kennedy's exploration into original programming was started in late 2008 with WK Radio,[11] and subsequently in Fall 2009 with WKEntertainment.
Awards[edit]
Two of the agency's television ads for Nike have won Emmy Awards: "The Morning After," which featured a runner on New Year's Day in 2000, not noticing that every dire Y2K prediction has come to pass; and "Move," which edited seamlessly dozens of athletes and children moving from one sport or activity to another. The Morning After aired in late 1999 and won the Emmy in 2000; Move aired during the 2002 Winter Olympics and won the Emmy that year.
In 2002, the Gunn Report named W+K as the most-awarded agency in the world,[12] and the agency was AdWeek's "Global Agency of the Year" in 2007.[13]
"It's Mine", Wieden+Kennedy's advertisement for Coca-Cola which aired during Super Bowl XLII in 2008, was named as the best Super Bowl commercial of the decade by Adweek magazine.[14] The magazine also picked W+K's "Grrr" for Honda as the overall commercial of the decade.[14] Meanwhile, Bob Garfield of AdAge added Wieden+Kennedy's "Go Forth" for Levi's as one of the worst ads in 2009.[14]
The next year Adweek named them as agency of the year for their work, which included "The Man Your Man Could Smell Like" campaign for Old Spice.[15]
Both Creativity and AdAge named Wieden+Kennedy agency of the year for 2010.[16] In 2011, Fast Company named Wieden+Kennedy as one of the 50 most innovative companies.[17]

History[edit]
Dan Wieden met David Kennedy in 1980, at the William Cain advertising agency while working on the Nike account. They took Nike with them as a client after founding Wieden & Kennedy (later changed to Wieden+Kennedy) on April 1, 1982, and remain the agency of record.[4] The agency's first advertisements were three television commercials for Nike that were aired during the New York City Marathon in October 1982.[5]
Over the years, the agency has added offices in New York City, London, Amsterdam, Shanghai, Beijing, Tokyo, Delhi and in late 2010, São Paulo. W+K's turbulent relationship with former client Subaru is the basis of Randall Rothenberg's 1995 book Where the Suckers Moon: The Life and Death of an Advertising Campaign.[6]
Media[edit]
Main article: WKE (WKEntertainment)
Wieden+Kennedy has created original content for various brands under the moniker W+K Entertainment since 2001. Its productions include Battlegrounds,[7] an MTV2 series showcasing streetball;[8] Ginga,[9] a documentary about Brazilian football (soccer) players; and Road to Paris,[10] documenting Lance Armstrong's path to his third Tour de France victory in 2001.
In 2003, Wieden+Kennedy created W+K Tokyo Lab, a record label and creative workshop based out of the agency's Tokyo office. Since 2003, W+K Tokyo Lab has released CD/DVD titles that combine music, graphics, and film. Tokyo Lab's current roster features local hip-hop and electronic artists including Hifana, DJ Uppercut, Afra, and Takagi Masakatsu.
2004 saw the launch of "Wieden+Kennedy 12", a 13-month experimental advertising program that accepts 13 applicants each year for an intensive laboratory experience where students work for real clients under the direction of members of the W+K Portland office.
In 2006, Wieden+Kennedy debuted an afternoon showcase of established and emerging musical artists in the atrium of W+K's Portland office, dubbed the "LunchBox" concert series. Past concerts have featured Janelle Monáe, Art Brut, The Rapture, Son Volt, Lyrics Born, Ladytron, Cut Chemist, Cold War Kids, Nada Surf, Juliette and the Licks, Pete Yorn and Snax.
Wieden+Kennedy's exploration into original programming was started in late 2008 with WK Radio,[11] and subsequently in Fall 2009 with WKEntertainment.

Boy Scout Abuse
























Boy Scout Abuse








The Boy Scouts of America (and other youth camping organizations)
The Boy Scouts of America (BSA) is one of the largest youth organizations in the United States, with 2.7 million youth members and over one million adult volunteers. While many boys have had good experiences in Scouting, many others have not. Unfortunately, the Boy Scouts has a well-documented 100-year-old problem with child sexual abuse in Scouting.
Since the 1910s, the Boy Scouts of America has been aware that sexual predators use positions of trust (like Scoutmaster or Assistant Scoutmaster) to sexually abuse boys in Scouting.  By 1920, the BSA had already established a “red flag” system used in part to identify adult volunteers who were known to sexually molest scouts. This red flag system evolved into what is now known as the “Ineligible Volunteer Files” (IV files or “perversion files”). Despite BSA’s awareness of these pedophiles, too often the organization did nothing to prevent predators from having access to Boy Scouts. In fact, BSA sometimes knowing decided to allow known pedophiles to continue working with boys in Scouting under a secret internal policy they called “probation.”
The attorneys at Crew Janci LLP have represented many men who were sexually abused in Scouting – including in Cub Scout packs, Webelos, Blazer Scouts, Boy Scouts troops, Explorer Scout Posts, Sea Scouts, and other scouting programs. We have represented survivors in cases against the Boy Scouts and their local councils in more than a dozen states (including Oregon, California, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Florida, Montana, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Texas, Virginia, and Washington) and Canada. As a result of our work, we are proud to say that BSA has undertaken steps to improve child abuse prevention policies and ensuring greater protection of minor scouts.
In 2010, attorneys from Crew Janci LLP were part of the Plaintiff’s trial team in the landmark case of Kerry Lewis v. Boy Scouts of America, which involved claims for sexual abuse by a Scoutmaster in a Portland, Oregon Scout Troop operated through a local Mormon (LDS) church. The trial lasted six weeks and garnered international press coverage, ultimately resulting in a jury award for the victim of compensatory and punitive damages which totaled nearly twenty million dollars ($20 Million).
The centerpiece of the Kerry Lewis trial was BSA’s now infamous secret files on pedophiles in Scouting – known as the “Perversion Files” or “IV Files” (now available through our website). The IV Files were introduced into evidence and, for the first time ever, made public. Since then, we have created and maintained a database of these files our website.
We continue to represented victims abused in Scouting across the country and abroad. If you or someone you love has been a victim of childhood sexual abuse in Scouting, no matter how long ago the abuse occurred, contact the experienced attorneys at Crew Janci LLP today to determine your options.
