Product Details


You’re invited. . .into an open conversation. . .an ongoing exchanging of ideas. . . As our ways of communication and comprehension change and adapt, so too must the presentation of the gospel. And while it’s critically important that the content remain unchanged, the style and vehicle in which it is delivered must fit the culture it reaches. Through current cultural references and true stories, Daniel Rice, founder of #Gospel LLC, will help you come to see the gospel for what it really is and how it can radically alter your everyday life. Rice invites you into the conversation as he breaks down Paul’s explanation of the gospel in Romans in a way that is accessible and engaging. #Gospel. . .good news for a time and culture that desperately need it.

Product Description
This is one of four soups that are marked by their odd names. A woman near our factory asked us to make 4 soups in 2011 that were okay to eat on a Daniel Fast diet. Each of the soups has only whole grains, no sugar, no animal products and nothing artificial.


Ingredients:  Pardina lentils, brown rice, herbs and spices, dehydrated carrots, Vegetable Base (Yeast extract*, vegetable extracts (contains celery seed, oleorsin and mustard oil), herbs and spices, salt, potato flour, bell pepper, tomato & ground rice hull), dehydrated carrots, dehydrated celery and sea salt. No artificial flavors, preservatives or added M.S.G. *The yeast in the base is not for leavening and is acceptable for the Daniel Fast. 



You will need:	 1 cup V-8 juice or 8-oz. chopped tomatoes
1/4 teaspoon salt
Package Includes: Lentil and Rice Mixture
Spice packet
Vegetable base packet
Directions: Sort & rinse lentils. In 3 quart saucepan add 3-1/4 cups water, the complete soup packet and your choice of V-8 juice or chopped tomatoes. Cover and simmer until lentils are tender and rice is cooked, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally to keep from scorching. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve!

Crockpot Directions: Add water, the entire soup mix and precooked meat to the slow cooker.  Cook on low for 6 hours (minimum) to 8 hours (maximum). Cook on high for 3 1/2 hours (minimum) to 5 (maximum). Add tomato right before serving. Enjoy!
Daniel Fast Cooking Variations: Add 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar or lemon juice, and/or 1/2 cup of your favorite fresh vegetables.
Non-Daniel Fast Cooking Variations: Add your choice of browned ground beef, ground turkey, ham or bacon.
Vegetarian: Prepare without meat. If desired add meat substitute.
Legume Hints and Nutrition:
The USDA recommends that adults eat three cups of beans or legumes per week for the maximum health benefit. Legumes are naturally low in total fat, contain no saturated fat or cholesterol and are an excellent source of protein, calcium, iron, folic acid, and potassium.


Tidbits of History
In the year 605 BC the biblical prophet Daniel and his three friends were among the young Jewish nobility to be taken into captivity in Babylon. Daniel had committed his life to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, so when offered the King’s food, which had been dedicated to Babylonian gods and not prepared under strict Jewish standards, Daniel refused to eat it. Instead, he asked that he and his Hebrew companions be fed only pulse (food grown from seed) and drink only water. The steward in charge of their care reluctantly agreed to allow this change for 10 days and then test the health of the four young men. After the 10 days, the Hebrew men were found to be in far superior health and intellectual acuteness than the other slaves who ate the King’s food. Read the full account at www.Daniel-Fast.com.
The men went on to lead lives of the highest integrity with unwavering trust in their God. They were promoted to high rankings in the government, overcame many challenges and served as impeccable models for the life people can have when they submit their will to the will of the Most High God.
Today, hundreds of Christians throughout the world use the Daniel Fast as a method for spiritual fasting. The fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the prophet as recorded in Daniel 1 and Daniel 10 along with typical Jewish fasting principles. To learn more about this type of fasting, visit the Daniel Fast website at www.Daniel-Fast.com.
 
Even more Tidbits of History
Some of the earliest archeological dating goes back 13,000 years to caves discovered in Greece. They have been an important staple over the centuries and were mentioned in the bible in Genesis 25:30-34. In this story Esau gave up his birth right for a bowl of lentils.
The Daniel-Fast explained:
Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Daniel 1:12
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. Daniel 10:2-3
The Daniel Fast is a partial fast practiced by millions of Christians around the world. The definition of a biblical fast is to restrict some or all food for a spiritual purpose. The Daniel Fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the Hebrew prophet when he and his companions were in captivity in Babylon. Not wanting to defile his body by eating the king’s food, Daniel asked to be fed only pulse (food grown from seed) and drink only water. Daniel wrote of another of his fasts in which he ate no pleasant bread (leavened), drank no wine and ate no meat. With these guidelines, the Daniel Fast eating plan can be described as a vegan diet with more restrictions.
Men, women and teens who enter a period of prayer and fasting using the Daniel Fast experience answers to prayers, a more intimate relationship with God, a significant improvement in their health and well-being and also develop positive habits for their lifestyle as followers of Jesus Christ.

Product Description

Ingredients: Pardina lentils, brown rice, herbs and spices, dehydrated carrots, Vegetable Base (Yeast extract*, vegetable extracts (contains celery seed, oleorsin and mustard oil), herbs and spices, salt, potato flour, bell pepper, tomato & ground rice hull), dehydrated carrots, dehydrated celery and sea salt. No artificial flavors, preservatives or added M.S.G. *The yeast in the base is not for leavening and is acceptable for the Daniel Fast. 



Large Soup Directions, For Small Soups Cut Measurements in Half

You will need: 2 cups V-8 juice or 15-oz. chopped tomatoes
1/2 teaspoon salt
Package Includes: Lentil and Rice Mixture
Spice packet
Vegetable base packet
Directions: Sort & rinse lentils. In 3 quart saucepan add 6-1/2 cups water, the complete soup packet and your choice of V-8 juice or chopped tomatoes. Cover and simmer until lentils are tender and rice is cooked, about 1 hour. Stir occasionally to keep from scorching. Salt and pepper to taste. Serve!

Crockpot Directions: AAdd water, the entire soup mix and precooked meat to the slow cooker.  Cook on low for 6 hours (minimum) to 8 hours (maximum). Cook on high for 3 1/2 hours (minimum) to 5 (maximum). Add tomato right before serving. Enjoy!

Tidbits of History
In the year 605 BC the biblical prophet Daniel and his three friends were among the young Jewish nobility to be taken into captivity in Babylon. Daniel had committed his life to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, so when offered the King’s food, which had been dedicated to Babylonian gods and not prepared under strict Jewish standards, Daniel refused to eat it. Instead, he asked that he and his Hebrew companions be fed only pulse (food grown from seed) and drink only water. The steward in charge of their care reluctantly agreed to allow this change for 10 days and then test the health of the four young men. After the 10 days, the Hebrew men were found to be in far superior health and intellectual acuteness than the other slaves who ate the King’s food. Read the full account at www.Daniel-Fast.com.
The men went on to lead lives of the highest integrity with unwavering trust in their God. They were promoted to high rankings in the government, overcame many challenges and served as impeccable models for the life people can have when they submit their will to the will of the Most High God.
Today, hundreds of Christians throughout the world use the Daniel Fast as a method for spiritual fasting. The fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the prophet as recorded in Daniel 1 and Daniel 10 along with typical Jewish fasting principles. To learn more about this type of fasting, visit the Daniel Fast website at www.Daniel-Fast.com.
 
Even more Tidbits of History
Some of the earliest archeological dating goes back 13,000 years to caves discovered in Greece. They have been an important staple over the centuries and were mentioned in the bible in Genesis 25:30-34. In this story Esau gave up his birth right for a bowl of lentils.
The Daniel-Fast explained:
Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. Daniel 1:12
In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks. I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. Daniel 10:2-3
The Daniel Fast is a partial fast practiced by millions of Christians around the world. The definition of a biblical fast is to restrict some or all food for a spiritual purpose. The Daniel Fast is modeled after the fasting experiences of the Hebrew prophet when he and his companions were in captivity in Babylon. Not wanting to defile his body by eating the king’s food, Daniel asked to be fed only pulse (food grown from seed) and drink only water. Daniel wrote of another of his fasts in which he ate no pleasant bread (leavened), drank no wine and ate no meat. With these guidelines, the Daniel Fast eating plan can be described as a vegan diet with more restrictions.
Men, women and teens who enter a period of prayer and fasting using the Daniel Fast experience answers to prayers, a more intimate relationship with God, a significant improvement in their health and well-being and also develop positive habits for their lifestyle as followers of Jesus Christ.

   | Daniel Fast Vegan CookBook           CARING Carrot Daniel Fast Vegan     Daniel wrote: For three weeks I was in sorrow. I ate no fancy food or meat, I drank no wine, and I put no olive oil on my face or hair. Daniel 10:2-3.  Hello everyone! Giving up meat and dairy for a few weeks is definitely a sacrifice for many of us, plus cooking meals “from scratch” is not always easy. So I put this site together to give you some recipes and ideas that could help you out. This partial fast is an awesome way to submit ourselves to God as a church body and I’m looking forward to find out what He has in store for us. Let’s embrace it with joy, anticipation, and understanding of the importance of fasting in our spiritual walk with the Lord. Please browse the website and feel free to improvise these recipes and come up with your own concoctions. Be creative and experiment with new ingredients. — Eugenia GeorgePictures coming soon  Check back often for more recipes and ideas.Daniel Fast GuidelinesDisclaimer: I came across a few variations of the Daniel Fast while searching on the net. Some people, such as myself, eat whole wheat pasta but others may prefer to just eat vegetables and little of anything else. Don’t be legalistic about it. Just pray and do it with a good attitude without judging others. Regardless of how you choose to do the Daniel Fast, overall you are going to make a sacrifice by practically becoming a vegetarian for 21 days. The Daniel Fast is, in fact, more strict than a vegetarian diet because you can’t have any sugar, coffee, refined grains, fried foods, or dairy products. Foods That Are Allowed: Organic Whole Grains: Brown Rice, Wild Rice, Oats, Barley, Spelt, Whole Wheat, Buckwheat, Corn, Millet, Farro, Bulgur, etc.What are whole grains?Whole grains are basically grains that have not been refined and, therefore, still contain bran and germ.   For instance, brown rice, pop corn, and oats are whole grains. On the other hand, white rice  is not a whole grain because it is milled so the bran and germ is actually removed. Refined grains do not sprout but whole grains do. Whole grains contain almost 4 times more dietary fiber than refined grains. (Source: Wikipedia).Bread: Ezequiel, Genesis 1:29, and Mana breads which are all made with sprouted whole grains and some types are made without yeast. There are also some generic brands out there that you can try. You can eat other unleaved breads (no yeast) like whole-wheat  or corn tortillas, pita, plus other types of whole-grain flat breads. Avoid multi-grain bread which only contains some whole grains but it’s not 100% whole grain and probably fluffier. We have to avoid such delicacies :-).Organic Legumes: Beans (all kinds), lentils, peas, chickpeas.  *Legumes are an excellent source of protein.Organic Fruits: all kinds of fresh or frozen, organic fruit. Avoid canned and dried fruit which are both packed with added sugar. Dried fruit with no added sugar is OK if you are not diabetic. Bananas and other fruits with a high glycemic index may not be OK if you are diabetic. Check with your doctor or nutritionist.Organic Vegetables: all kinds of fresh or frozen, organic vegetables. You can also try organic veggie burgers. Make sure they are vegan because some types of veggie burgers contain eggs. If you are allergic to soy, then veggie burgers and meat substitutes are not recommended.Organic Seeds, Nuts, Nut Butters, Sprouts, FlaxSoy Products, Vinegar, Herbs, Natural Spices (cumin, turmeric, cinnamon, etc) , Almond Milk, Soy Milk, Brown Rice Milk, Oat Milk, Tofu, TempehQuality Oils: Grape seed Oil, Sesame Oil, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Canola Oil, etc. Limit the use of these oils for salad dressings and light sauteing.Liquids: Water, 100% All-Natural Fruit Juices, 100% All Natural Vegetable Juices (preferably homemade). It’s time to take out your Jack LaLanne juicer from the cupboard if you have one.Foods to Avoid:All Meat and Animal Products Chicken Seafood Eggs Dairy (Milk, Butter, Cheese) White Rice, Caffeine, Fried Foods Carbonated Beverages Energy Drinks Foods Containing Preservatives or Additives Refined Sugar, Cane Sugar, Raw Sugar, Molasses, Honey Artificial Sugar Substitutes White Flour and All Products Using It Margarine, Shortening, High Fat Products, Mayonnaise Potato and Corn Chips Junk FoodShare this:TweetEmailMoreLike this:Like Loading...

The Best Artists Copy – Daniel Rice – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upDaniel RiceBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingFounder of Green Mango Systems gogreenmango.com, a boutique custom software development studio.Jul 17The Best Artists Copy“Raphael Sanzio’s Sistine Madonna is beautiful but a bit derivative of Michelangelo, therefore it is not good” said no one ever.Copying the work of master artists was considered essential to training back in 16th-century Italy. The same can be said when designing software, there is no exception. There are 2.8 million available apps to download for Android users and 2.2 million downloadable apps for iOS users. The majority of these apps emulate each other to some degree. It’s okay to come to Green Mango with a terrific idea for an app or software product that was inspired by another one you’ve come across. Go ahead, describe it to us as the Uber for this or Shazam for that. That’s what the average user will recognize and feel comfortable with. It is not the similarities that are going to make your product outshine others, but your differentiators.Software development seems like an ambiguous process. In reality, over 90% of new apps and features are inspired by others already in existence. For example, the hamburger menu button ( ☰ ) , was originally designed for the Xerox Star. This style of menu button, which typically activates a drop-down or slide-out menu, saw a huge revival in its usage in 2009 when various mobile apps needed to compress their menu bar. This resurgence greatly benefited users world-wide, though some may disagree. Tech Crunch released an article detailing their reasons as to why some think the hamburger menu button is less efficient, and that’s the beauty of disagreement in regard to technological advancement. We can continue to refine on each other’s ideas, creating an overall smoother user experience for everyone.Society has become accustomed to certain UX behaviors. Your app can still be revolutionary while maintaining familiar functions. Take existing paradigms and use them in your app. If a first-time user downloads your app and cannot navigate their way by the first day, there is a 75% chance that user will never open your app again. Innovation and familiarity can and do go hand-in-hand.THE BEST ARTISTS COPY, THE WORST ARTISTS STEALThere’s a fine but solid line between copying and theft. We absolutely condemn using someone else’s hard work and claiming it as your own. Borrow from others’ base ideas and build from there- that’s how you upstage the competition.With this in mind, let us know what apps or products you drew inspiration from. Let us know which ideal features you’d like to draw from. We want to stay as close to your original concept so we need as much information as possible. Otherwise, we’ll be forced to take an educated guess and do our own research. It’s important to remember that the most expensive mistake to make is not actually launching a product with a few areas still under construction, but launching the wrong product altogether. Software is easily fixable and can be adjusted with a simple downloadable patch.Let’s not re-invent the wheel. Most apps that are available in the app store are similar to each other, that’s not news. However, it will be because of your unique tweaks and differentiators, that your app will flourish.ShareNever miss a story from Daniel Rice, when you sign up for Medium.

Ultimate Daniel Fast - Daniel Fast Recipes and Resources

Daniel Fast Food List

The Daniel Fast is based upon the prophet Daniel’s experiences as recorded in the Bible.  Scripture gives us some insight (such as in Dan. 10:3) into what he ate and didn’t eat; however, we don’t know his complete menu. What we do know is this: In Daniel 1, Daniel chose not to eat the royal food that he was being served and ate only vegetables and drank water. Another time (in Daniel 10:2-3) he deprived himself of choice food, meat, and wine as he sought the Lord in prayer. Most commentaries believe “choice food” would have been bread and sweets.
This is why, I believe, you will find some variation in the specific guidelines for the modern-day Daniel Fast, as far as what foods are included and which ones are restricted. The food guidelines on my website are the ones most commonly observed in a Daniel Fast. The intention of today’s Daniel Fast is not to duplicate exactly what Daniel did but the spirit in which he did it. Daniel’s passion for the Lord caused him to hunger and thirst more for spiritual food than for physical food, which should be the desire of anyone choosing to participate in this type of fast.
Try not to get too hung up on what you should and shouldn’t eat. The most important part of the Daniel Fast is that you deny yourself physically so that you may seek the Lord in prayer and grow closer to Him. Your fast may look a little different than someone else’s, and that’s fine. Some people may need to be stricter than others in their food choices so that their fast is a sacrifice for them. These food guidelines are meant to be just that – a guide. They are given to help you create boundaries for your fast.
The Daniel Fast Food List

All fruit – fresh, frozen, dried, juiced, or canned.
All vegetables – fresh, frozen, dried, juiced, or canned.
All whole grains – amaranth, barley, brown rice, oats, quinoa, millet, and whole wheat.
