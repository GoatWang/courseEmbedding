What are analysts saying about Microchip Technology Incorporated stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Microchip Technology Incorporated stock: 
1. Mizuho analysts commented, "We were able to briefly catch up with MCHP management and, while we believe JunQ orders are strong, capacity constraints may be driving some challenges into the SepQ. Maintaining our Neutral, but raising estimates and our PT to $80. While MCHP is executing well under CEO Steve Sanghi, we believe at ~16x P/E the stock is fairly valued. With strong FCF we expect MCHP to focus on continuing M&A. MCHP noted broad strength in multiple verticals industrial, automotive which could be a positive for CY and ON. KeyPoints MCHP tightened its guidance to the high end of its range. MCHP narrowed its JunQ guide towards the higher end of the range given out on the MarQ earnings call." (6/7/2017)
2. Needham & Company LLC analysts commented, "During the past two days, we hosted a series of investor meetings in New York and Boston with Microchip’s CFO, Eric Bjornholt, and VP of Europe Finance and Investor Relations, Nawax Sharif. The company outlined multiple growth drivers including: MCU market growth/share gains (currently ~13% market share), an Analog attach strategy and the continued integration of Atmel/ open to more M&A. We are modeling non-GAAP EPS of $4.45 in 2018 and $5.00 in 2019 and a FCF margin of 30%." (3/10/2017)
3. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Microchip is one of the better-positioned companies in the semiconductor industry based on its product strength. The company's expanding product portfolio enables it to continuously outperform the broader industry. We believe that the company's impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results and positive outlook will help it sustain momentum going ahead. Moreover, acquisitions like that of Atmel are likely to expand its geographical presence, augment customer base, extend product portfolio and supplement operational excellence. We note that the company has outperformed the broader industry in the past one-year. However, high integration costs continue to be a drag on profitability. The semiconductor industry is also intensely competitive and is characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change." (2/10/2017)
