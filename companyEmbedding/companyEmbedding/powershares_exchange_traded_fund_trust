DisclaimerPlease refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Closing price is as of 4:00 PM (EST) and may not include after-hour trades. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.38% of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/29/2020, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. ETFs have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Underlying Index is comprised of equity securities from developed global markets selected to represent a diversified set of factor characteristics,originally developed by the adviser. FTSE International Limited is the Index Provider. Holdings in the Underlying Index are selected from the constituents of the FTSE Developed Index which is comprised of large- and mid-cap equity securities in developed markets. The rules based proprietary multi-factor selection process utilizes investment characteristics including,but not limited to, attractive relative valuation, positive price momentum, low volatility, and specific market capitalization.The equity securities in the Underlying Index will be diversified across global regions and industries. These securities will be large- and mid-cap equity securities of companies from developed countries, including common stock, preferred stock and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The FTSE Developed Index is a market-capitalization weighted index representing the performance of large and mid cap companies in Developed markets. The index is derived from the FTSE Global Equity Index Series(GEIS), which covers 98% of the world's investable market capitalization. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the performance of large companies in the U.S. stock market. Index levels are in total return USD.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. International investing has a greater degree of risk and increased volatility due to political and economic instability of some overseas markets. Changes in currency exchange rates and different accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can affect returns.  International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns. All rights in the FTSE Index (the "Index") invest in FTSE International Limited ("FTSE"). "FTSEÂ®" is a trade mark of the London Stock Exchange Group companies and is used by FTSE under licence. The Fund has been developed solely by J.P. Morgan. The Index is calculated by FTSE or its agent. FTSE and its licensors are not connected to and do not sponsor, advise, recommend, endorse or promote the Fund and do not accept any liability whatsoever to any person arising out of (a) the use of, reliance on or any error in the Index or (b) investment in or operation of the Fund. FTSE makes no claim, prediction, warranty or representation either as to the results to be obtained from the Fund or the suitability of the Index for the purpose to which it is being put by J.P. Morgan. The fund uses derivatives, which may be riskier than other types of investments and may increase the volatility of the fund. The fund may not track the return of its underlying index for a number of reasons, such operating expenses incurred by the fund that are not applicable to the index, and the time difference between calculating the value of the index and the net asset value of the fund. Index returns and sector returns are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual Fund performance. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns.Holdings are subject to change. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

DisclaimerPlease refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Closing price is as of 4:00 PM (EST) and may not include after-hour trades. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.43% of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/29/2020, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. ETFs have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Underlying Index is comprised of equity securities from developed global markets (excluding North America)selected to represent a diversified set of factor characteristics, originally developed by the adviser. FTSE International Limited is the Index Provider. Holdings in the Underlying Index are selected from the constituents of the FTSE Developed ex North America Index, which is comprised of large- and mid-cap equity securities in developed markets outside of North America. The rules based proprietary multi-factor selection process utilizes the following characteristics: relative valuation, price momentum, low volatility, and specific market capitalization. The equity securities in the Underlying Index will be diversified across international regions and industries. These securities will be large- and mid-cap equity securities of companies from developed countries, including common stock, preferred stock and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The FTSE Developed ex North America Index is part of a range of indices designed to help investors benchmark their international investments. The index comprises Large and Mid cap stocks providing coverage of Developed markets, excluding the US and Canada. The index is derived from the FTSE Global Equity Index Series (GEIS), which covers 98% of the world's investable market capitalization. The MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index measuring equity market performance of developed markets, excluding the U.S. and Canada. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the performance of large companies in the U.S. stock market. Index levels are in total return USD.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. International investing has a greater degree of risk and increased volatility due to political and economic instability of some overseas markets. Changes in currency exchange rates and different accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can affect returns.  Narrowly focused investments typically exhibit higher volatility. Index returns and sector returns are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual Fund performance. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged. The fund uses derivatives, which may be riskier than other types of investments and may increase the volatility of the fund. The fund may not track the return of its underlying index for a number of reasons, such operating expenses incurred by the fund that are not applicable to the index, and the time difference between calculating the value of the index and the net asset value of the fund. All rights in the FTSE Index (the "Index") invest in FTSE International Limited ("FTSE"). "FTSEÂ®" is a trade mark of the London Stock Exchange Group companies and is used by FTSE under licence. The Fund has been developed solely by J.P. Morgan. The Index is calculated by FTSE or its agent. FTSE and its licensors are not connected to and do not sponsor, advise, recommend, endorse or promote the Fund and do not accept any liability whatsoever to any person arising out of (a) the use of, reliance on or any error in the Index or (b) investment in or operation of the Fund. FTSE makes no claim, prediction, warranty or representation either as to the results to be obtained from the Fund or the suitability of the Index for the purpose to which it is being put by J.P. Morgan. Diversification does not guarantee investment returns and does not eliminate the risk of loss. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns.Holdings are subject to change.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 Q&A: Why We Believe You Can Beat the Index 
 How Well Have American Funds Scored? 
 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com.

  Fund Objectives, Investment Strategies and Risks  




















Objective(s)













Investment Strategies













Risks













 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Growth Fund of America 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks and seeks to invest in companies that appear to offer superior opportunities for growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in common stocks of large- and mid-capitalization issuers. The fund may invest up to 25% of its assets in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, GFA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks. 











 The Investment Company of America 









The fund’s investment objectives are to achieve long-term growth of capital and income. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks, most of which have a history of paying dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, potential for capital appreciation and future dividends are given more weight than current yield. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund may invest up to 15% of its assets, at the time of purchase, in securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, ICA investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Investing outside the United States involves risks such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Washington Mutual Investors Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to produce income and to provide an opportunity for growth of principal consistent with sound common stock investing. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of established companies that are listed on, or meet the financial listing requirements of, the New York Stock Exchange and have a strong record of earnings and dividends. In the selection of common stocks and other securities for investment, current and potential yield as well as the potential for long-term capital appreciation are considered. The fund seeks to provide an above-average yield in relation to the S&P 500 Index. The fund strives to maintain a fully invested, diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of high-quality common stocks. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, WMIF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests. 











 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

 Factors can be viewed as the DNA, or building blocks, of an investment portfolio. Historically, they have carried certain traits and behaviors. When combined, factors can act as the building blocks of a diversified portfolio.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

	SPHD  
		- PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio
	
	

Equity - US Equity




Product Details
The PowerShares S&P 500® High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (Fund) seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index (Index). The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. Standard & Poor's® compiles, maintains and calculates the Index, which is composed of 50 securities traded on the S&P 500 Index that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted semi-annually, in January and July.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Fund in Focus 









 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Securities that pay high dividends as a group can fall out of favor with the market, causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay high dividends. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. Standard & Poor's® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("Standard & Poor's") and have been licensed for use by the Adviser. The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor's or its Affiliates, and Standard & Poor's and its Affiliates make no representation, warranty or condition regarding the advisability of buying, selling or holding shares of the Fund. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Product Details
The PowerShares S&P 500® High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio (Fund) seeks investment results that generally correspond (before fees and expenses) to the price and yield of the S&P 500 Low Volatility High Dividend Index (Index). The Fund generally will invest at least 90% of its total assets in common stocks that comprise the Index. Standard & Poor's® compiles, maintains and calculates the Index, which is composed of 50 securities traded on the S&P 500 Index that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility. The Fund and the Index are rebalanced and reconstituted semi-annually, in January and July.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Securities that pay high dividends as a group can fall out of favor with the market, causing such companies to underperform companies that do not pay high dividends. There is no assurance that the Fund will provide low volatility. Standard & Poor's® and S&P® are registered trademarks of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC ("Standard & Poor's") and have been licensed for use by the Adviser. The Fund is not sponsored, endorsed, sold or promoted by Standard & Poor's or its Affiliates, and Standard & Poor's and its Affiliates make no representation, warranty or condition regarding the advisability of buying, selling or holding shares of the Fund. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

While smart beta has become a buzz word, the concept is far from new. Institutional investors have used alternative weighting and factor-driven strategies since the 1970s, albeit not labeled "smart beta." Now that the term has become mainstream, PowerShares by Invesco would like to provide insight on where we see opportunities for investors.

Overview
Smart Beta Funds
Resources



Overview

Employing Features of Both Worlds
Smart beta strategies seek to offer investors an alternative to the traditionally polarized passive and active portfolio construction options. They are not simply offshoots of active management or ETF replication vehicles. Through smart beta ETF strategies, we believe investors have the opportunity to retain broad market exposure, potentially achieve long-term outperformance when compared to an index, and reduce portfolio risk in a liquid, transparent, and low cost way.1,2

A Pioneer in Smart Beta ETF Strategies
PowerShares believes that smart beta strategies offer exposure to the best of both worlds, providing investors a valuable alternative that expands portfolio construction opportunities. We were founded on the belief that all investors should be provided with a smarter way to access the markets - beyond traditional active and passive strategies. PowerShares introduced many of the first smart beta vehicles available today calling them "Intelligent ETFs."3


There is no assurance that an investment strategy will outperform or achieve its investment objectives
1 Liquidity: Shares are not individually redeemable and owners of the shares may acquire those shares from the Fund and tender those shares for redemption to the Fund in Creation Unit aggregations only, typically consisting of 50,000, 75,000, 100,000 or 200,000 shares.
Transparency: ETFs disclose their holdings daily.
Low Cost: Since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each buy and sell transaction, frequent activity may increase the cost of ETFs.
2Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.
3 When we say that our ETFs are intelligent, we mean that in several different ways. Please see "Important Information" below for a more detailed explanation.




PowerShares Smart Beta ETF Strategies
As a pioneer in smart beta ETF strategies, PowerShares markets a number of time-tested options suitable for various market conditions and investor profiles.

Invesco Strategic Smart Beta ETF Hypothetical Portfolios Quarterly Report 
Smart Beta Correlation and Factor Chart Brochure 
The Invesco White Paper Series on the Active/Passive Debate






Glossary & Terms
Beta: is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. For example, a beta of one means that the security is expected to move with the market. A beta of less than one means the security is expected to be less volatile than the overall market. Betas greater than one are expected to exhibit more volatility or movement than the general market.
Factor Driven: A method of using objective style determinates, such as book value, cash flow, sales and dividends, within an index in attempt to achieve mutually exclusive security selection.
Front Month Roll: is a process in which an index automatically rolls to the next available futures contract with a predetermined expiration month (e.g. the next-to-expire contract).
Liquidity: Liquidity is characterized by a high level of trading activity and is a measure of the degree to which an asset or stock can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its asset price. Assets or stocks that can be easily bought or sold are known as liquid assets.
Low Cost: Since ordinary brokerage commissions apply for each buy and sell transaction, frequent activity may increase the cost of ETFs.
Market-Cap-Weighted: A type of index in which individual components are weighted according to market capitalization. Index value can be calculated by adding the market capitalizations of each index component and dividing that sum by the number of securities in the index.
Optimum Yield™: A roll methodology that is specially designed for investors to gain access to the commodities market the way many institutions or commodity professionals would , rather than employing a front month roll methodology.
Smart Beta: An alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both.
Transparency: ETFs disclose their holdings daily.

Important Information
When we say that our ETFs are intelligent, we mean that in several different ways:
One of our largest family of ETFs is based on Intellidexes™ - dynamic indexes that use rules-based quantitative analysis to choose stocks for their capital appreciation potential. We believe this is an intelligent way for an index to select stocks.
Our ETFs based on FTSE RAFI® indexes weight stocks according to fundamental economic factors. We believe this is a more intelligent weighting method than market-cap weighting. Furthermore, our Fundamental Index ETFs are based on four factors - sales, cash flow, book value and dividends - which we believe is a more balanced, intelligent approach than weighting stocks according to just one fundamental measure.
We also have a wide range of ETFs that target narrow slices of the market (Intelligent Access) - from niche industries to specific world regions.
For investors who are interested in these niches, we believe ETFs - which invest in multiple companies within a market sector - may offer a more intelligent investment approach than stock picking.
Our PowerShares DB commodity funds (Intelligent Access) provide systematic access to some of the world's most important commodities by seeking to replicate rules-based indexes composed of futures contracts that trade on some of the most liquid and deep commodity markets in the world.
Overall, no matter what the focus, all ETFs offer investors tax efficiency and trading flexibility, which make them an intelligent investment tool for investors to consider. Whether you're looking for broad market exposure, specialized investment strategies or access to niche markets, we believe PowerShares ETFs represent an intelligent option for your portfolio.

General Risk Information
Investments focused in a particular industry are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments.
There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

				NASDAQ Composite Index returns shown are price return.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month. There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular sector, such as basic materials, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. Momentum style of investing is subject to the risk that the securities may be more volatile than the market as a whole or returns on securities that have previously exhibited price momentum are less than returns on other styles of investing. The fund may engage in frequent trading of its portfolio securities in connection with the rebalancing or adjustment of the Underlying Index. The S&P 500® Materials Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of the materials market. The Dynamic Basic Materials Sector Intellidex™ Index evaluates companies based on a variety of investment merit criteria, including price momentum, earnings momentum, quality, management action, and value. The NASDAQ US Benchmark Index is a float-adjusted market-cap-weighted index designed to track the performance of securities to the United States. The Global Industry Classification Standard was developed by and is the exclusive property and a service mark of MSCI, Inc. and Standard & Poor's. There is no relationship between Dorsey, Wright & Associates, LLC ("Dorsey Wright") and PowerShares by Invesco ("PowerShares") other than a license by Dorsey Wright to PowerShares of certain Dorsey Wright trademarks, tradenames, investment models, and indexes (the "DWA IP"). DWA IP has been created and developed by Dorsey Wright without regard to and independently of PowerShares, and/or any prospective investor. The licensing of any DWA IP is not an offer to purchase or sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. A determination that any portion of an investor's portfolio should be devoted to any ETF product developed by PowerShares or investment model developed by Dorsey Wright is a determination made solely by the investment advisor serving the investor or the investor himself, not Dorsey Wright. Beta is a measure of risk representing how a security is expected to respond to general market movements. Smart Beta represents an alternative and selection index based methodology that seeks to outperform a benchmark or reduce portfolio risk, or both. Smart beta funds may underperform cap-weighted benchmarks and increase portfolio risk.

DisclaimerPlease refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Closing price is as of 4:00 PM (EST) and may not include after-hour trades. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.38% of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/29/2020, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. ETFs have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Underlying Index is comprised of equity securities from developed global markets selected to represent a diversified set of factor characteristics,originally developed by the adviser. FTSE International Limited is the Index Provider. Holdings in the Underlying Index are selected from the constituents of the FTSE Developed Index which is comprised of large- and mid-cap equity securities in developed markets. The rules based proprietary multi-factor selection process utilizes investment characteristics including,but not limited to, attractive relative valuation, positive price momentum, low volatility, and specific market capitalization.The equity securities in the Underlying Index will be diversified across global regions and industries. These securities will be large- and mid-cap equity securities of companies from developed countries, including common stock, preferred stock and real estate investment trusts (REITs). The FTSE Developed Index is a market-capitalization weighted index representing the performance of large and mid cap companies in Developed markets. The index is derived from the FTSE Global Equity Index Series(GEIS), which covers 98% of the world's investable market capitalization. MSCI World Index (net of foreign withholding taxes) is a broad measure of the performance of developed countries' equity markets. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index generally representative of the performance of large companies in the U.S. stock market. Index levels are in total return USD.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. International investing has a greater degree of risk and increased volatility due to political and economic instability of some overseas markets. Changes in currency exchange rates and different accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can affect returns.  International investing bears greater risk due to social, economic, regulatory and political instability in countries in "emerging markets." This makes emerging market securities more volatile and less liquid developed market securities. Changes in exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can also affect returns. All rights in the FTSE Index (the "Index") invest in FTSE International Limited ("FTSE"). "FTSEÂ®" is a trade mark of the London Stock Exchange Group companies and is used by FTSE under licence. The Fund has been developed solely by J.P. Morgan. The Index is calculated by FTSE or its agent. FTSE and its licensors are not connected to and do not sponsor, advise, recommend, endorse or promote the Fund and do not accept any liability whatsoever to any person arising out of (a) the use of, reliance on or any error in the Index or (b) investment in or operation of the Fund. FTSE makes no claim, prediction, warranty or representation either as to the results to be obtained from the Fund or the suitability of the Index for the purpose to which it is being put by J.P. Morgan. The fund uses derivatives, which may be riskier than other types of investments and may increase the volatility of the fund. The fund may not track the return of its underlying index for a number of reasons, such operating expenses incurred by the fund that are not applicable to the index, and the time difference between calculating the value of the index and the net asset value of the fund. Index returns and sector returns are for illustrative purposes only and do not represent actual Fund performance. Index performance returns do not reflect any management fees, transaction costs or expenses. Indexes are unmanaged. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. Investment returns and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. ETF shares are bought and sold throughout the day on an exchange at market price (not NAV) through a brokerage account, and are not individually redeemed from the fund. Shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by Authorized Participants, in very large creation/redemption units. For all products, brokerage commissions will reduce returns.Holdings are subject to change. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. Sharpe ratio measures the fund's excess return compared to a risk-free investment. The higher the Sharpe ratio, the better the returns relative to the risk taken. Tracking Error: The active risk of the portfolio, which determines the annualized standard deviation of the excess returns between the portfolio and the benchmark. Alpha: The relationship between the performance of the Fund and its beta over a three-year period of time. Standard deviation/Volatility: A statistical measure of the degree to which the Fund's returns have varied from its historical average. The higher the standard deviation, the wider the range of returns from its average and the greater the historical volatility. The standard deviation is calculated over a 36-month period based on Fund's monthly returns. The standard deviation shown is based on the Fund's Class A Shares or the oldest share class, where Class A Shares are not available. R2: The percentage of a Fund's movements that result from movements in the index ranging from 0 to 100. A Fund with an R2 of 100 means that 100 percent of the Fund's movement can completely be explained by movements in the Fund's external index benchmark. Risk measures are calculated based upon the Funds' broad-based index as stated in the prospectus.

Five American Funds that Beat the First Index Fund’s Lifetime Results 







A look at the first index fund ― the Vanguard 500 Index Fund ― and the five U.S.-focused American Funds available when it launched confirms the following: The idea that you can’t beat the index over long-term periods is a myth. 





























The Potential for Greater Wealth 
As you can see, an investment manager with a proven track record of outpacing the market can produce significantly greater wealth than an index investment.
A comparison of the lifetime results of the first index fund to the results of five American Funds over that same period illustrates our advantage. Those funds are AMCAP Fund, American Mutual Fund, The Growth Fund of America, The Investment Company of America and Washington Mutual Investors Fund. The comparison is especially apt as that index fund was designed to track the S&P 500, which is also the benchmark for the five American Funds which seek to pursue investment objectives such as growth, income or preservation of capital. Watch and see how the American Funds fared since the index fund’s inception — from August 31, 1976, through December 31, 2016:

 Q&A: Why We Believe You Can Beat the Index 
 How Well Have American Funds Scored? 
 The Capital Advantage: A Closer Look 
 


























Figures shown are past results for Class A shares for American Funds (Investor shares for Vanguard 500 Index Fund) and are not predictive of results in future periods. Current and future results may be lower or higher than those shown. Share prices and returns will vary, so investors may lose money. Investing for short periods makes losses more likely. Unless otherwise indicated, American Funds returns are shown at maximum offering price (MOP) and reflect deduction of the 5.75% maximum sales charge at the beginning of the period shown. Thus, the net amount invested was $9,425 ($1,885/per fund in the American Funds Blend scenario.). The maximum initial sales charge  was 8.50% prior to July 1, 1988. All distributions were reinvested. The Vanguard fund has no up-front sales charge and is available in another share class with a lower expense ratio. This share class was not available for investment at the inception of the fund. The American Funds are now also available in less expensive share classes that do not feature a sales charge. Current information and month-end results for the Vanguard fund can be found at vanguard.com. For current information and month-end results for the American Funds, visit americanfunds.com.

 American Mutual Fund 









The fund strives for the balanced accomplishment of three objectives: current income, growth of capital and conservation of principal.











The fund seeks to invest primarily in common stocks of companies that are likely to participate in the growth of the American economy and whose dividends appear to be sustainable. Although the fund focuses on investments in medium to larger capitalization companies, the fund’s investments are not limited to a particular capitalization size. The fund invests primarily in securities of issuers domiciled in the United States and Canada. The fund may also invest in bonds and other debt securities, including those issued by the U.S. government and by federal agencies and instrumentalities.











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMF investors exposure includes the following risks:

Small company stocks entail additional risks, and they can fluctuate in price more than larger company stocks.
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond prices and a bond fund’s share price will generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates.
Income provided by the fund may be reduced by changes in the dividend policies of, and the capital resources available for dividend payments at, the companies in which the fund invests.











 AMCAP Fund 









The fund’s investment objective is to provide you with long-term growth of capital. 











The fund invests primarily in common stocks of U.S. companies that have solid long-term growth records and the potential for good future growth. The fund may invest in common stocks and other securities of issuers domiciled outside the United States to a limited extent. 











In addition to the investing risks inherent in stocks of U.S.-domiciled companies, AMCAP investors exposure includes the following risks:

 Vanguard 500 Index Fund 









The Fund seeks to track the performance of a benchmark index that measures the investment return of large- capitalization stocks. 











The fund employs an indexing investment approach designed to track the performance of the Standard & Poor‘s 500 Index, a widely recognized benchmark of U.S. stock market performance that is dominated by the stocks of large U.S. companies. The Fund attempts to replicate the target index by investing all, or substantially all, of its assets in the stocks that make up the Index, holding each stock in approximately the same proportion as its weighting in the Index. 











The fund exposes investors to the risks inherent in investing in stocks of companies domiciled in the U.S., including the volatility that comes with its full exposure to the stock market. 

















































*Figures shown are for the period August 31, 1976, the inception date of the first index fund, through March 31, 2017. Standard deviation is a measure of how returns over time have varied from the mean and is one of the most common measures of absolute volatility. A lower number signifies lower volatility.
†The Vanguard 500 Index Fund has no up-front sales charge
Actively managed funds typically have higher turnover than index funds, which may have tax implications. Portfolio turnover is a measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold within a 12-month period. The lower the percentage, the less buying and selling took place. 
Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus. 











Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. Expense ratios are as of each fund’s prospectus available at time of publication. When applicable, investment results reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which results would have been lower. Please see americanfunds.com for more information. Source for industry average expense ratios is Lipper, based on comparable categories for front-end load funds (except for the Vanguard fund, which is no load, not front-end load), excluding funds of funds, as of each fund’s most recent fiscal year-end available as of March 31, 2017. The Lipper categories for the funds are: AMCAP Fund (Growth); The Growth Fund of America (Large-Cap Growth); The Investment Company of America, Washington Mutual Investors Fund and American Mutual Fund (Growth & Income); and Vanguard 500 Index Fund (S&P 500 Index Objective Funds).

American Funds Have Two Important Traits 



 
 










When you compare mutual funds, it’s not surprising that funds from investment managers who “eat their own cooking” — investing more of their own money in the funds they oversee — have tended to outpace the market index more frequently than their peers. It’s also logical that funds with lower expense ratios have tended to outpace the index more frequently. Combining these two traits — high manager ownership and low expense ratios — can help you identify a select group of funds with a track record of outpacing indexes over long periods.1









 Characteristics of Core Funds That Added Value  Two Screens Can Help Sharpen Your Search  





    





Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar® data.1 






















 






Narrowing Your Search


















 
 










The sheer number of available funds can be overwhelming. We examined the large universe of equity funds in Morningstar’s U.S. and foreign large-cap categories over a 20-year period and looked for funds with two traits: those within the lowest 25% of expenses, and those within the highest 25% in manager ownership. We found that the funds with both characteristics (highest manager ownership and lowest expense ratios) meaningfully improved average outcomes for investors.







 Look for Funds That Meet Two Key Criteria  Large-Cap Equity Funds With Low Expense Ratios and High Manager Ownership  











Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.2






















 






Boosting Success Rates





 
 










As shown in the chart below, not all funds are equal. Most, in fact, rarely outpace the index. However, funds with the lowest expenses have tended to do better than their peers. And funds with high manager ownership have done even better than that. Significantly, the group of funds that share both those characteristics have done better over five- and 10-year periods.
A portfolio of large-cap funds with lower expense ratios and higher manager ownership, on average, outpaced indexes more frequently than other funds. Since large-cap funds account for a big part of most portfolios, those higher success rates can result in substantial gains. 











 Two Steps Raised the Success Rate  Success Rates in Large-Cap Equities (Net of Fees)  





























Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data.1
































1 Source: Capital Group, based on Morningstar data. Based on monthly returns from January 1997 to December 2016. U.S. funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. U.S. index is S&P 500. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. International index is MSCI ACWI ex USA. The indexes are unmanaged and, therefore, have no expenses. Investors cannot invest directly in an index. Unless otherwise indicated, all distributions were reinvested. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology. 
2 Data as of December 31, 2016. Domestic funds are those in the Morningstar Large Value, Large Blend and Large Growth categories. International funds are those in the Morningstar Foreign Large Value, Foreign Large Blend and Foreign Large Growth categories. Size of quartiles varies because those funds in the Morningstar database that did not include an expense ratio or firm-level investment ownership were excluded from the analysis. For more information about the screening process, see Methodology.

Select Funds Can Reduce Risk
Index funds fall as far as the market they track, but investors don’t have to. Over time they can gain more by losing less.





















  AUGUST 2016





Share




 
 















Gain by Losing Less
There are two ways to beat the index and fuel investment growth – earn more than the market or lose less than the market.
Losing less – the so-called low-downside capture approach – holds appeal for investors. Especially considering that 78% of them list protecting assets as their top investment priority but only about half are aware that index funds expose them to 100% of market downturns. 

Downside capture:
A fund’s downside capture ratio is an indication of whether a fund has lost more or less than the market during periods of market weakness. For example, if over the course of a downturn a fund fell only 96% as far as the market, its downside capture ratio is 96%. If it fell 5% more than the market, its downside capture ratio is 105%. 














  See how American Funds delivered index-beating returns by losing less  







    






                A closer look at the power of low “downside capture” shows how our U.S. stock focused goods have tended to beat the index even as they trailed the market during the good times.  
              

























Why It Matters
Consistently losing less during downturns can be instrumental in producing larger balances and superior outcomes for long-term investors. Funds that limit downside risk tend to also provide a smoother ride, making it easier for those with long-term objectives to stay the course during turbulent markets.




















The Arithmetic of Loss
The ability to achieve superior outcomes by losing less is an example of what’s known as the arithmetic of loss. Consider the following:
If a $1,000 investment loses 50%, its value drops to $500. In order for the investment to return to the $1,000 level, that $500 must do more than gain 50% (which would only bring it to $750); it needs to double.
Digging out of a hole is never easy, but the shallower the hole, the shorter the climb.










Better Positioned by Losing Less
The farther an investment falls, the longer the path back to break even. Some funds offer the potential to hold on to more of one’s investment during market declines which leaves investors better positioned for a rebound.








































To Mitigate Risk, Seek Funds That Have Held Up Better During Declines
Looking at a fund’s downside capture ratio — a comparison of how far it has fallen relative to its index during downturns — is one way to evaluate its riskiness.
When we added downside capture to two other screening criteria — low expenses and high levels of manager investment — we uncovered a group of funds that has, on average, delivered index-beating results.









Finding Funds That Can Mitigate Risk
Within the universe of Large Cap U.S. funds, screening for funds with downside resilience — funds that capture less of a market decline than the index — results in a lower risk group that, on average, outpaced its peers as well as the S&P 500 Index.
Further narrowing the low-downside group using low expenses and high manager ownership as additional screening criteria increased the advantage over the index and reduced risk further. The chart shown here is based on data for rolling five-year periods for the 20 years ended December 31, 2015.




















See methodology.























Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.

Important Legal Information
This site is intended only for U.S. residents. Using it means you agree to our Terms of Use page.
All investments involve risks, including possible loss of principal. Generally, those offering potential for higher returns are accompanied by a higher degree of risk. Stock prices fluctuate, sometimes rapidly and dramatically, due to factors affecting individual companies, particular industries or sectors, or general market conditions. Bond prices are affected by interest rate changes. Bond prices, and thus a bond fund's share price, generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates. As the price of bonds in a fund adjusts to a rise in interest rates, the fund's share price may decline. Special risks are associated with foreign investing, including currency fluctuations, economic instability and political developments; investments in emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors. To the extent the fund focuses on particular countries, regions, industries, sectors or types of investment from time to time, it may be subject to greater risks of adverse developments in such areas of focus than a fund that invests in a wider variety of countries, regions, industries, sectors or investments.  Smaller, mid-sized and relatively new or unseasoned companies can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions, and their prospects for growth are less certain than those of larger, more established companies. Historically, these securities have experienced more price volatility than larger company stocks, especially over the short-term.Performance of the funds may vary significantly from the performance of an index, as a result of transactions costs, expenses and other factors. For strategic beta ETFs, there can be no assurance that a fund's multi-factor stock selection process will enhance performance. Exposure to such investment factors may detract from performance in some market environments, perhaps for extended periods.  For actively managed ETFs, there is no guarantee that the manager's investment decisions will produce the desired results. These and other risks are discussed in the fund’s prospectus.
For more information on any funds, contact your financial advisor or download a prospectus. Investors should carefully consider a fund's investment goals, risks, sales charges and expenses before investing. The prospectus contains this and other information. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing or sending money.
ETFs trade like stocks, fluctuate in market value and may trade at prices above or below the ETF’s net asset value. Brokerage commissions and ETF expenses will reduce returns.
Net Asset Value (NAV) represents an ETF’s per-share-value. The NAV per share is determined by dividing the total NAV of the Fund by the number of shares outstanding. The Fund calculates the NAV per share each business day as of 1 p.m. Pacific time which normally coincides with the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and BATS BZX Exchange (BATS). The Fund does not calculate the NAV on days the NYSE and BATS are closed for trading. If the NYSE and BATS have a scheduled early close or unscheduled early close, the Fund’s share price would still be determined as of 1 p.m. Pacific time.            
ETF shares may be bought or sold throughout the day at their market price, not their Net Asset Value (NAV), on the exchange on which they are listed. Shares of ETFs are tradable on secondary markets and may trade either at a premium or a discount to their NAV on the secondary market. Prior to trading in the secondary market, shares of the fund are “created” at NAV by market makers, large investors and institutions only in block-size Creation Units. Each “creator” or “Authorized Participant” enters into an authorized participant agreement with Franklin Templeton Distributors, Inc., an affiliate of Franklin Advisers, Inc. Only an Authorized Participant may create or redeem Creation Units directly with the fund.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
