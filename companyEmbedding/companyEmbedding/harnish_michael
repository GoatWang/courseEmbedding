ARA Sterility Maintenance Study










12/8/15





ARA's Delbert Harnish, Michael McDonald, and Brian Heimbuch conducted a study on sterility maintenance of surgical instruments to prevent bacterial contamination. The study, “Sterility Maintenance Study: Dynamic Evaluation of Sterilized Rigid Containers and Wrapped Instrument Trays to Prevent Bacterial Ingress,” used a dynamic aerosol test method that allowed for air exchanges to occur in SPS that may simulate normal air exchanges in hospital settings.
