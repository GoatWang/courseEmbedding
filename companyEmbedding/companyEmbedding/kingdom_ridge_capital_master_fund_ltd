Background[edit]
The founder of Blue Ridge Capital, John Griffin, is believed to have been a "right-hand man" to the billionaire manager Robertson.[6] Blue Ridge Capital generally targets "absolute returns" by investing in and short-selling companies, with a focus on "going long" (i.e. buying the stock of companies rather than selling it short.) Blue Ridge's investment thesis is based on fundamental analysis, and focuses on companies that have competitive advantages in their industries, while shorting those thought to have "fundamental problems." The principal, Griffin, is highly compensated and after a 65% return on the fund in 2007 he reportedly made $625 million.[6] That was their best year, however: after surviving the financial crisis with a loss of only 8%, the fund has since underperformed the S&P 500.[7]
Investment process[edit]
Blue Ridge has a lengthy process for vetting both long and short investments. Generally, they are focused on individual companies rather than a sector; a "checklist methodology" is used to identify good performers in a given category. Industry outlook is also taken into account in the investment process. Key factors in the consideration of industry-relevant matters are the power of stakeholders, barriers to market entries, ingredients of success, and business development opportunities. Analysts at Blue Ridge also need to address the business model, the management, the financial structure, and the risks of the company they're considering; a detailed time line is also created, which attempts to pin down catalysts for a changed valuation in the share price.[7] A prospective investment must also be evaluated for the presence of questionable accounting practices.
Joint ventures[edit]
In 2008, Blue Ridge Capital's division in China started a joint venture with Equity International investing in Xinyuan Real Estate. In December 2007, Xinyuan Real Estate went public on the NYSE as an ADR ticker symbol XIN. It traded slightly above $15 per share but settled between $1–$3.[8]
Political activities[edit]
Blue Ridge donated $100,000 to Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy.[9]

Background[edit]
The founder of Blue Ridge Capital, John Griffin, is believed to have been a "right-hand man" to the billionaire manager Robertson.[6] Blue Ridge Capital generally targets "absolute returns" by investing in and short-selling companies, with a focus on "going long" (i.e. buying the stock of companies rather than selling it short.) Blue Ridge's investment thesis is based on fundamental analysis, and focuses on companies that have competitive advantages in their industries, while shorting those thought to have "fundamental problems." The principal, Griffin, is highly compensated and after a 65% return on the fund in 2007 he reportedly made $625 million.[6] That was their best year, however: after surviving the financial crisis with a loss of only 8%, the fund has since underperformed the S&P 500.[7]
Investment process[edit]
Blue Ridge has a lengthy process for vetting both long and short investments. Generally, they are focused on individual companies rather than a sector; a "checklist methodology" is used to identify good performers in a given category. Industry outlook is also taken into account in the investment process. Key factors in the consideration of industry-relevant matters are the power of stakeholders, barriers to market entries, ingredients of success, and business development opportunities. Analysts at Blue Ridge also need to address the business model, the management, the financial structure, and the risks of the company they're considering; a detailed time line is also created, which attempts to pin down catalysts for a changed valuation in the share price.[7] A prospective investment must also be evaluated for the presence of questionable accounting practices.
Joint ventures[edit]
In 2008, Blue Ridge Capital's division in China started a joint venture with Equity International investing in Xinyuan Real Estate. In December 2007, Xinyuan Real Estate went public on the NYSE as an ADR ticker symbol XIN. It traded slightly above $15 per share but settled between $1–$3.[8]
Political activities[edit]
Blue Ridge donated $100,000 to Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy.[9]

Christopher F. Zepf

Managing Principal
Portfolio Manager
Chris Zepf is the Managing Principal and Portfolio Manager of Kingdom Ridge Capital, LLC.  Prior to founding Kingdom Ridge, Mr. Zepf managed a stand-alone long/short technology portfolio at SAC Capital Advisors, LLC in Stamford, Connecticut from 2002-2007.  Before joining SAC Capital, Chris was with Fidelity Management & Research in Boston from 1997-2002.
Mr. Zepf started at Fidelity as a summer intern and was mentored by famed bottom-up fundamental analyst and portfolio manager Peter Lynch.  After that summer Chris was hired to work as a full-time analyst while simultaneously completing his second year MBA studies. Shortly after graduation, Chris moved to Boston and was named the portfolio manager of two Fidelity sector funds (the Select Air Transportation Fund and the Select Transportation Fund).  After handily beating the benchmarks for these two funds, Fidelity created the Advisor Developing Communications Fund so Chris could return to technology stocks.  Mr. Zepf soundly beat his portfolio benchmarks with this fund as well and was promoted to lead Fidelity’s 18 member Technology Research Team.  Chris was also named portfolio manager of Fidelity’s $5+ billion Technology Sector Fund.
Before Fidelity, Mr. Zepf was an equity analyst at investment bank Wasserstein Perella & Co. where he covered technology stocks.
Chris, a native of Cincinnati, Ohio, graduated from the University of Notre Dame with a B.S. in Economics.  He holds a Masters in Business Administration from the Tuck School at Dartmouth College.
Mr. Zepf is a member of the Applied Investment Management (AIM) Advisory Board at the University of Notre Dame. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of Applied Micro Circuits (AMCC) and Hekima Place, a Kenyan orphanage for girls.

Investment Approach






Kingdom Ridge Capital, LLC manages the Kingdom Ridge Capital Master Fund, Ltd. which employs a long/short strategy focused on publicly listed equities in the technology sector. Kingdom Ridge has a research team that focuses on bottom-up fundamental analysis to pick stocks for its portfolios.  Kingdom Ridge’s founders focus the research team on the technology sector because they believe technology is the best sector for fundamental stock picking.  This belief is based on the observation that technology companies exhibit rapid rates of innovation that can lead to pronounced changes in company fundamentals. These changes in fundamentals – often caused by product cycle activity – ultimately move earnings estimates and drive stock performance dispersion.  To capitalize on these characteristics, Kingdom Ridge runs a concentrated portfolio that puts the bulk of our assets behind our highest conviction ideas. 

 
 
“Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing.”  – Warren Buffett
 
 
 
 
 
 
Disclaimer: The above represents Kingdom Ridge Capital’s experience, opinions and assumptions and should not be understood as a prediction or projection of actual outcomes or market/sector characteristics.  Our investment approach and strategy involve significant risks, including the availability of opportunities, the execution of ideas and ultimately the loss of principal and are subject to change without notice.
