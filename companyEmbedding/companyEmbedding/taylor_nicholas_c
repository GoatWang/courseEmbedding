Don't waste your time and money

        reviewed on May 13, 2016    


If you are looking for a property manager who will not look after your property, take 4 months to organise urgent repairs (if at all) and who does not respond to enquiries, look no further.  Poor service which will cost owners a lot of money.  I would trust someone else to look after your property and tenants.
