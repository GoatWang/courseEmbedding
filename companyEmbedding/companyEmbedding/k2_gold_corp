K2Gold Corporation
EXPLORING YUKON’S SOUTH KLONDIKE GOLD DISTRICT / THE ‘WELS PROJECT’ A SIGNIFICANT NEW GRASSROOTS GOLD DISCOVERY

Investor Information

Corporate Presentation








About company

K2 is a junior resource company focused on exploring for gold in the Yukon. The company plans to grow by acquiring further mineral properties in North America and by leveraging the Chairman’s past successes (Kaminak being the most recent), and undertaking smart, cost effective exploration. It will also continue to utilize its strength and good reputation in financial markets to ensure adequate financial resources for the projects it acquires or discovers. We believe in early community engagement from the onset, to establish a solid foundation upon which strong working relationships and partnerships can be built.
Meet the Team





Investor highlights

K2Gold (TSX-V: KTO.V)
K2’s Chairman, John Robins, was the founder of Kaminak Gold. Kaminak sold the Coffee deposit; a multi-million ounce gold resource to Goldcorp for $520M in 2016. It will be the largest hard rock mine in the Yukon since gold was discovered in the Territory in 1896.

Wels Project

Wels is a new IRGS gold discovery in a previously unrecognized mineral district 60km south of Goldcorp’s 2.2 Moz Coffee deposit. Its mineralization is attributed to IRGS (granite intrusive) deposits akin to the >6 million-ounce Fort Knox and Dublin Gulch in the prolific Tintina Belt of Alaska and Yukon. The area comprises 229 contiguous ‘quartz claims’ covering an area of approximately 4,788 hectares.

Flume

Flume is Located 70 km north of the Kaminak (Goldcorp) Coffee gold project and 40 km northwest from Kinross's Golden saddle project. It was first staked in 1999 by Phelps Dodge who completed property wide soil sampling, rock sampling and trenching. It was then acquired by Valley High Ventures in 2009 who optioned it to Ryan Gold in 2010.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Beyond Tesla: 7 stocks driving the autonomous car revolution
              
              Look at these component manufacturers rather than the car companies, says Jeff Reeves.

These 7 highly taxed companies need Congress to finally act on tax reform
              
              It wasn’t Trump’s “movement” that lifted stocks late last year, says Jeff Reeves. It was the promise of lower corporate tax rates.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.
