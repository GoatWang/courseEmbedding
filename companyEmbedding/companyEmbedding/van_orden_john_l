MEMORANDUM AND ORDER
AUDREY G. FLEISSIG, District Judge.
This matter is before the Court on Defendants' motion (Doc. No. 382) to exclude the reports and testimony of Plaintiffs' expert witnesses, David Prescott and Brian Abbott, from the bench trial in this case. For the reasons set forth below, the motion shall be granted in part and denied in part.
BACKGROUND
Plaintiffs in this class action are civilly committed residents of the Missouri Department of Mental Health's ("DMH's") Sex Offender Rehabilitation and Treatment Services ("SORTS") facilities, who have been declared sexually violent predators ("SVPs") under Missouri's SVP statute, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 632.480 et seq. Plaintiffs assert claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., challenging the care and treatment provided to SORTS residents, and the reimbursement sought by the state for that treatment.
One of Plaintiffs' experts, David Prescott, is a licensed clinical social worker. He serves as the Director of Professional Development and Quality Improvement for Becket Family of Services, which operates a range of inpatient and outpatient programs, including treatment of individuals who have been sexually abused. He previously served as the Clinical Director of the Minnesota Sex Offender Program in Moose Lake, Minnesota and as the Treatment Assessment Director for Wisconsin's Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center, both of which are SVP civil commitment programs like SORTS. Prescott has also served as a consultant and trainer for other state SVP civil commitment programs. He conducted a training of clinicians at the SORTS facility in Farmington, Missouri in 2014.
In his expert report, Prescott provides the following opinions:
Opinion 1: SORTS, as presently constituted, is not structured in such a manner to provide effective and comprehensive mental health treatment necessary to result in conditional or full releases for any covered residents.
Opinion 2: The standards for release of SORTS residents are vague, unrealistic and unachievable, and further not supported by mental health professional standards.
Opinion 3: SORTS does not make use of or employ the least restrictive alternative for its residents.
(Doc. No. 383-1.)
Plaintiffs' other expert, Brian Abbott, is a licensed clinical psychologist and clinical social worker. He has worked as a clinician, forensic evaluator, author, and trainer in the area of child sexual abuse. He has treated or supervised the treatment of hundreds of sex offenders, and he has testified in SVP civil commitment proceedings around the country, including in Missouri.
In his expert report, Abbott provides the following opinions: (1) SVP civil commitment programs represent flawed public policy in general; (2) the standards for release at SORTS are unrealistic and/or unachievable; (3) SORTS does not have an effective treatment program because it appears that SORTS does not allow releases to less restrictive alternatives, SORTS appears to be underfunded, residents appear to be receiving less than the amount of treatment time provided at other sex offender treatment programs, and the lack of releases at SORTS likely instills a sense of hopelessness in SORTS residents, which is counter-therapeutic; (4) the SORTS conditional release program is unrealistic, unworkable, and disingenuous because, for example, conditionally released residents do not appear to be permitted to spend meaningful time outside of the SORTS facilities, and it appears that residents the DMH identified as being eligible for conditional release were not informed of this fact and were not afforded an opportunity for conditional release; (5) SORTS lacks a least restrictive alternative; and (6) Missouri's SVP civil commitment procedures in general appear to be biased toward promoting commitment. (Doc. No. 383-4.)
Neither Prescott nor Abbott interviewed any of the residents or staff at SORTS. Instead, they based their opinions on a review of discovery in this case and their training, education, and experience with other SVP civil commitment programs around the country. The discovery reviewed by both experts includes emails and correspondence among DMH employees expressing concerns regarding overcrowding, understaffing, underfunding, and low or non-existent "graduation" rates at SORTS; treatment materials from a one-time treatment director at SORTS, Dr. Mark Carich; other documents and interrogatory responses produced by Defendants; and transcripts of depositions conducted in this case.
Defendants do not challenge the qualifications of Prescott or Abbott; rather, they argue that the expert reports and accompanying testimony are not based on sufficient facts or data, are unhelpful, and do not reliably apply the principles and methods to the facts of the case. Defendants argue that the experts' opinions are inadmissible because they are based on "outdated" emails and documents. Defendants note that the experts did not interview any residents or staff at SORTS, did not discuss standards of release with anyone at SORTS, do not know whether the treatment materials they reviewed were ever implemented at SORTS, and do not know what treatment methods are currently being used at SORTS.
Defendants also argue that Abbott's opinions regarding the SVP civil commitment process generally, including that it represents flawed public policy and appears biased toward commitment, are irrelevant to the issues in this case, which are limited to the constitutionality of the care and treatment provided to SORTS residents and the reimbursement sought for that treatment.
Plaintiffs respond that Defendants' challenges regarding the factual bases of the expert testimony go to the weight of the testimony, not its admissibility. Plaintiffs argue that the experts' extensive experience with SVP civil commitment programs around the country, and their review of the extensive discovery in this case, provide a sufficient basis for their opinions and will help the Court resolve the issues in this case. Plaintiffs note that Defendants will be free at trial to challenge the data upon which the experts relied, and to present their own experts' opinions.
Plaintiffs also argue that Abbott's opinions regarding Missouri's SVP civil commitment process generally are relevant to Plaintiffs' claims that the care and treatment at SORTS is unconstitutional and, alternatively, a violation of the ADA. Plaintiffs note that Abbott's opinions discuss the psychological evaluations performed by certified forensic experts during the civil commitment process, and the fact that some SORTS residents were committed despite an evaluation that they did not suffer from a mental abnormality and/or did not meet the risk threshold set forth in the SVP statute. Plaintiffs argue that these evaluations are relevant to their care and treatment claims because the evaluations should have, but have not, been considered in formulating the treatment provided to, and standards for release of, the respective SORTS residents. In other words, Plaintiffs argue that Abbott's opinions regarding the continued commitment of SORTS residents who were at one time found to not suffer from a mental abnormality that makes them sexually dangerous help demonstrate that SORTS program, as applied in these instances, is unlawful.
DISCUSSION
The admission of expert testimony in federal court is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Wagner v. Hesston Corp., 450 F.3d 756, 758 (8th Cir. 2006). Rule 702 provides:
A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:
(a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702. The rule was amended in 2000 in response to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), which charged trial judges with a "gatekeeping" role to exclude unhelpful and unreliable expert testimony.
"As a general rule, the factual basis of an expert opinion goes to the credibility of the testimony, not the admissibility, and it is up to the opposing party to examine the factual basis for the opinion in cross-examination." First Union Nat. Bank v. Benham, 423 F.3d 855, 862 (8th Cir. 2005). "Only if the expert's opinion is so fundamentally unsupported that it can offer no assistance to the jury must such testimony be excluded." Id. And any "doubts regarding whether an expert's testimony will be useful should generally be resolved in favor of admissibility." Clark By & Through Clark v. Heidrick, 150 F.3d 912, 915 (8th Cir. 1998) (citations omitted).
Moreover, because "[t]he main purpose of Daubert exclusion is to protect juries from being swayed by dubious scientific testimony," Daubert standards are relaxed in bench trials, where there is no jury and the trial court is the fact finder. In re Zurn Pex Plumbing Prods. Liab. Litig., 644 F.3d 604, 613 (8th Cir. 2011); Tussey v. ABB, Inc., 746 F.3d 327, 337 (8th Cir. 2014) ("In a bench trial, we not only give the trial court wide latitude in determining whether an expert's testimony is reliable, we also relax Daubert's application.") (internal citations omitted); David E. Watson, P.C. v. United States, 668 F.3d 1008, 1015 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding that Daubert's application is relaxed for bench trials because "there is less need for the gatekeeper to keep the gate when the gatekeeper is keeping the gate only for himself") (citation omitted).
In this bench trial, the Court finds that the expert reports and testimony of Prescott and Abbott are admissible except in one narrow respect, discussed below. The Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the factual bases of the expert opinions are matters of credibility, not admissibility. Any weaknesses perceived by Defendants in the factual bases of the expert opinions may be explored on cross examination. See Garrett v. Albright, No. 06-CV-0785, 2008 WL 795610, at *2 (W.D. Mo. Mar. 21, 2008) (rejecting the defendants' attack on factual basis of expert's conclusion, including "what records he may or may not have reviewed, whether he should have made calls to . . . other hospitals or whether one interview was sufficient," and holding that these matters went to credibility, not admissibility); Kay v. Lamar Adver. of S. Dakota, Inc., No. CIV. 07-5091-KES, 2009 WL 2606234, at *3 (D.S.D. Aug. 21, 2009) ("Defendants argue that Dr. Lierman could have obtained additional facts by interviewing some of the officers of ARXX. The fact that Dr. Lierman may have obtained additional data does not demonstrate that Dr. Lierman relied on insufficient facts.").
The Court will, however, exclude Abbott's opinions that SVP civil commitment programs represent flawed public policy in general, and that Missouri's SVP civil commitment procedures appear to be biased toward promoting commitment. As Defendants correctly note, Plaintiffs do not challenge Missouri's ability to civilly commit SVPs. Therefore, Abbott's opinions regarding whether the civil commitment of SVPs is bad policy or Missouri's procedures are biased are unhelpful and irrelevant. The Court will grant Defendants' motion to exclude these two opinions. However, this ruling should not be read to prohibit Plaintiffs from introducing the factual information upon which Abbott may have relied, such as the nature of the psychological evaluations conducted during the civil commitment process, to the extent Abbott contends these evaluations should impact treatment and standards of release at SORTS.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants' motion to exclude the testimony and reports of David Prescott and Brian Abbott is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. (Doc. No. 382.) The motion is GRANTED with respect to Abbott's opinions that the SVP civil commitment process is flawed public policy and biased in favor of commitment. The motion is DENIED in all other respects.

Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
In a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.
The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a pro bono basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."[1] Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."[1] Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "swing vote" in both cases was Breyer.

Background[edit]




Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol


The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide was placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film The Ten Commandments.[2] The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.
The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."
Plurality opinion[edit]
The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:


I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.


Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.
Breyer's concurrence[edit]




Monument with State Capitol in background


Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in Van Orden v. Perry, Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in McCreary he did not. As a result, the Van Orden case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.
In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "secular purpose":


The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization. Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.
The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.

The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans — to predominate.




Breyer then goes on to state:

If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."
Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in McCreary, he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to Van Orden v. Perry.
Stevens' dissent[edit]
Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.

Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
In a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.
The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a pro bono basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."[1] Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."[1] Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "swing vote" in both cases was Breyer.

Background[edit]




Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol


The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide was placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film The Ten Commandments.[2] The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.
The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."
Plurality opinion[edit]
The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:


I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.


Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.
Breyer's concurrence[edit]




Monument with State Capitol in background


Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in Van Orden v. Perry, Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in McCreary he did not. As a result, the Van Orden case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.
In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "secular purpose":


The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization. Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.
The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.

The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans — to predominate.




Breyer then goes on to state:

If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."
Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in McCreary, he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to Van Orden v. Perry.
Stevens' dissent[edit]
Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.

Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
In a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.
The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a pro bono basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."[1] Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."[1] Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "swing vote" in both cases was Breyer.

Background[edit]




Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol


The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide was placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film The Ten Commandments.[2] The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.
The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."
Plurality opinion[edit]
The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:


I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.


Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.
Breyer's concurrence[edit]




Monument with State Capitol in background


Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in Van Orden v. Perry, Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in McCreary he did not. As a result, the Van Orden case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.
In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "secular purpose":


The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization. Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.
The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.

The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans — to predominate.




Breyer then goes on to state:

If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."
Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in McCreary, he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to Van Orden v. Perry.
Stevens' dissent[edit]
Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.

Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
In a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.
The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a pro bono basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."[1] Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."[1] Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "swing vote" in both cases was Breyer.

Background[edit]




Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol


The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide was placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film The Ten Commandments.[2] The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.
The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."
Plurality opinion[edit]
The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:


I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.


Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.
Breyer's concurrence[edit]




Monument with State Capitol in background


Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in Van Orden v. Perry, Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in McCreary he did not. As a result, the Van Orden case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.
In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "secular purpose":


The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization. Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.
The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.

The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans — to predominate.




Breyer then goes on to state:

If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."
Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in McCreary, he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to Van Orden v. Perry.
Stevens' dissent[edit]
Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.

Van Orden v. Perry, 545 U.S. 677 (2005), was a United States Supreme Court case involving whether a display of the Ten Commandments on a monument given to the government at the Texas State Capitol in Austin violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.
In a suit brought by Thomas Van Orden of Austin, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled in November 2003 that the displays were constitutional, on the grounds that the monument conveyed both a religious and secular message. Van Orden appealed, and in October 2004 the high court agreed to hear the case at the same time as it heard McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a similar case challenging a display of the Ten Commandments at two county courthouses in Kentucky.
The appeal of the 5th Circuit's decision was argued by Erwin Chemerinsky, a constitutional law scholar and the Alston & Bird Professor of Law at Duke University School of Law, who represented Van Orden on a pro bono basis. Texas' case was argued by Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott. An amicus curiae was presented on behalf of the respondents (the state of Texas) by then-Solicitor General Paul Clement.
The Supreme Court ruled on June 27, 2005, by a vote of 5 to 4, that the display was constitutional. The Court chose not to employ the popular Lemon test in its analysis, reasoning that the display at issue was a "passive monument."[1] Instead, the Court looked to "the nature of the monument and . . . our Nation’s history."[1] Chief Justice William Rehnquist delivered the plurality opinion of the Court; Justice Stephen Breyer concurred in the judgment but wrote separately. The similar case of McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky was handed down the same day with the opposite result (also with a 5 to 4 decision). The "swing vote" in both cases was Breyer.

Background[edit]




Ten Commandments Monument at the Texas State Capitol


The monument challenged was 6-feet high and 3-feet wide was placed in 1961. It was donated to the State of Texas by the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a civic organization, with the support of Cecil B. DeMille, who had directed the film The Ten Commandments.[2] The State accepted the monument and selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state agency responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds. The donating organization paid for its erection. Two state legislators presided over the dedication of the monument.
The monument was erected on the Capitol grounds, behind the capitol building (between the Texas Capitol and Supreme Court buildings). The surrounding 22 acres (89,000 m²) contained 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the "people, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity."
Plurality opinion[edit]
The plurality opinion stated that the monument was constitutional, as it represented historical value and not purely religious value. The primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments. An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments. Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ. The bottom of the monument bears the inscription "PRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961."
Below the above matter, and the title "the Ten Commandments", the monument's text reads in full:


I AM the LORD thy God.
Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.
Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy neighbor's.


Thomas Van Orden challenged the constitutionality of the monument. A native Texan, Van Orden passed by the monument frequently when he would go to the Texas Supreme Court building to use its law library.
Breyer's concurrence[edit]




Monument with State Capitol in background


Breyer's concurrence in this case is made all the more interesting because on the surface it appears that he voted quite differently in the McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, a case which was heard and decided at the same time and seems, to the casual observer, virtually identical. However, in Van Orden v. Perry, Breyer submitted an opinion separate from that of the Court, while in McCreary he did not. As a result, the Van Orden case was decided by a plurality, not a majority as the other.
In opening his discussion of reasoning Breyer states:

The case before us is a borderline case. It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol. On the one hand, the Commandments' text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity. On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this case. Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is used. And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.

He then goes on to list points which are stated to be insufficient individually, but together seem to provide a reasonable basis for "secular purpose":


The monument's 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that nonreligious aspects of the tablets' message predominate.
The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, is a private civic (and primarily secular) organization. Who, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments' role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization's efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.
The Eagles' consulted with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text — an act which underscores the group's ethics-based motives.
The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display.
The physical setting of the monument suggests little or nothing of the sacred.

The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the "ideals" of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.
The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.
The setting does provide a context of history and moral ideals.
The larger display (together with the display's inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State's citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed. That is to say, the context suggests that the State intended the display's moral message — an illustrative message reflecting the historical "ideals" of Texans — to predominate.




Breyer then goes on to state:

If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments' text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here. As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner). And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation. Hence, those 40 years suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to "engage in" any "religious practic[e]," to "compel" any "religious practic[e]," or to "work deterrence" of any "religious belief." Schempp, 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring). Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets' message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.

Breyer continues to explain a position which seeks to balance between not "lead[ing] the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause of the First Amendment traditions" and "recogniz[ing] the danger of the slippery slope" and ultimately rests upon a "matter of degree [which] is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one."
Breyer concludes by stating he cannot agree with the plurality, nor with Justice Scalia's dissent in McCreary County v. ACLU of Kentucky, but while he does agree with Justice O'Connor's statement of principles in McCreary, he disagrees with her evaluation of the evidence as it bears on the applying those principles to Van Orden v. Perry.
Stevens' dissent[edit]
Stevens' dissenting opinion essentially stated that, in formulating a ruling for this case, the court had to consider whether the display had any significant relation to the specific and secular history of the state of Texas or the United States as a whole. Ultimately, Stevens asserted that the display "has no purported connection to God's role in the formation of Texas or the founding of our Nation [. . .] " and therefore could not be protected on the basis that it was a display dealing with secular ideals. In fact, Stevens says that the display transmits the message that Texas specifically endorses the Judeo-Christian values of the display and thus, the display violates the establishment clause.
