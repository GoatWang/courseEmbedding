The Ten Reasons


1. A Refreshingly Personal Service
We offer straight and direct communication with an experienced director. We won’t treat you like a form filling robot and squeeze you through a call centre. You will always have a personal contact to speak to as and when you want to. Where else can you still get this?


2. Finance Brokers with a Track Record for Success
                        Our record speaks for itself, with over 40 years’ experience in successfully arranging business finance. But don’t just take our word for it - see what our clients have to say about us!
                    

3. We Understand Small Businesses
                        We know that every small business is unique. That’s why you can deal with an experienced business person, who is able to understand what is important for you and your business, in order to arrange the right finance for you.
                    

4. Direct Access to Lenders and Terms
                        Your time is precious, and you have better things to do than getting frustrated by running around from lender to lender. Our job is to remove the ever increasing hurdles imposed on you by lenders.
                    

5. ASC Take the Hassle out of Business Finance
                        We offer straight and direct communication with an experienced director. We won’t treat you like a form filling robot and squeeze you through a call centre. You will always have a personal contact to speak to as and when you want to. Where else can you still get this?
                    

6. We’re on your Side, we are Independent
                        ASC are independent finance brokers. As experienced professionals, we don’t work for the banks, we work for you - our success is aligned with your success.
                    

7. Local Service - National Strength
                        You benefit from both the local director’s dedicated personal attention and the support of the central unit. Your local bank manager has disappeared – but ASC are still here.
                    

8. Coordination with your Professional Advisors
                        We co-ordinate our work with all your professional advisors, from solicitors to valuers and lenders. Whilst we focus on organizing finance, you can focus on what is important to you: developing and operating your business.
                    

9. ASC are Highly Recommended
                        We enjoy many important endorsements. You can relax, knowing that you have the benefit of dealing with a market leader, with a successful track record of arranging business finance.
                    

10. Nothing but Business Finance
                        We only work in business finance – nothing else. Our job is simply to arrange finance which works for you: Sensible Finance for Sensible Deals at Sensible Rates!

How to Structure a Hospital/Physician ASC Partnership the Right Way














28May2015 


 






The ambulatory surgery center industry stands at a crossroads. With most areas of the country saturated with ASCs, net growth has stalled for the first time in recent history. The across-the-board elimination of out-of-network reimbursements has reduced profit margins at most ASCs, putting some facilities in peril and forcing others to take a hard look at their business strategies. At the same time, ASC reimbursements during the past decade have declined by more than 30 percent as a percentage of hospital outpatient department reimbursements. And the average per-case reimbursement for independent ASCs is 40 percent lower than that of a hospital-affiliated ASC. Given this challenging environment, it’s easy to understand why there’s been a nearly 20 percent decrease in the number of independent ASCs since 2000: In many markets, it’s simply too hard to turn a profit as a stand-alone facility. To meet this changing landscape, ASCs increasingly are partnering with hospitals to optimize profit and secure sustained growth. In our May 7 session at the Becker’s Hospital Review 6th Annual Meeting, I walked through many aspects of Regent’s innovative approach to structuring hospital and physician joint ventures, including:
The evolution of ASC partnerships
While fewer ASCs are being built today, hospitals and ASC companies are acquiring existing ASCs to create successful three-way partnerships. In the past, hospitals have had reservations regarding physician partnerships: Hospital leaders not only wanted majority ownership, but also control of operations — frequently a nonstarter for physicians. Financial realities are forcing many hospitals to reconsider this demand. The latest ownership and governance models typically allow physicians to maintain operational control of an ASC, while providing them a healthy financial result both in the case of a sale and on future earnings. Shrinking reimbursements, too, are forcing physicians to reconsider an ASC partnership with a hospital. The reasons are numerous: 1) hospital-affiliated ASCs reap significantly higher payments for cases than independent facilities; 2) strategic alliances with hospitals are consistent with the aims of healthcare reform models; 3) these deals provide a hedge against shrinking practice reimbursements for surgeons; and 4) joint venture ASCs hold a competitive advantage over ASCs that do not partner with hospitals.
Hospital contracting model
The hospital contracting model is emerging as the leading approach for structuring joint venture partnerships between physicians and hospitals. By allowing the hospital to form a strategic alliance with select surgeons, it minimizes the provider’s financial investment and helps achieve physician alignment goals. If structured correctly, payments per case using the hospital contracting model are at least 30 percent higher than an independent ASC’s reimbursements. This model also provides competitive protections for doctors and allows them to maintain daily clinical and operations control over the facility. The governance structure of the hospital contracting model maximizes physician financial upside, while also promoting hospital earnings. In this model, hospitals hold two board seats, physicians hold four seats and a management company maintains one seat. Physicians are Class A shareholders, while hospitals and the management company are Class B shareholders. Hospitals control Class B and the majority vote, and physicians retain voting control over clinical issues while the management company controls key legal and financial issues. This model also provides hospitals with decision-making authority over budgets, strategic decisions and disposition of assets, while physicians manage the selection of anesthesia providers, clinically related operating policies and procedures, and approval of equipment purchases. The hospital contracting model, however, is not recommended in every situation. Typically, the hospital contracting model is successful:

When the doctors trust the local hospital;
In an over-saturated, competitive ASC market;
In a community where payors squeeze the independent ASCs on price and out-of-network facilities have to change to a contracted model;
In a market where the hospital of choice is accustomed to joint ventures with doctors;
Where hospitals are interested in partnering with doctors;
In a market where the hospital has a strong track record of negotiating favorable contract rates and also has contracting power;
In an existing ASC, when the ASC has matured and/or does not see a significant increase in profits in the future; and
If the local surgeons can utilize this model to form a strategic alliance with the local hospital of choice.

The HOPD model
In situations where hospital contracting model is a poor fit, the HOPD model provides an alternative solution that allows for a co-management agreement between hospitals and physicians. In this model, hospitals own 100 percent of the ASC, thus enabling HOPD rates. Furthermore, surgeons and management companies are united to provide operational and clinical oversight. The HOPD model provides an excellent opportunity to create a partnership in situations when a joint venture is unrealistic. As with the hospital contracting model, HOPDs can help achieve physician alignment and patient volume goals and be a successful part of a hospital’s overall business strategy.

10 reasons to work with ASC








Why ASC?








close ✖

Why ASC?
You already know that arranging business finance can be a tricky experience.
We appreciate that your time is precious. With our extensive knowledge of business finance available in today’s SME market we can approach the lending institutions that are right for your business finance needs. You will be saved from the frustration of endless form filling, repeated conversations with numerous lenders, and save you from having to provide each different lender stacks and stacks of information.
Our job is to remove the ever increasing number of hurdles that are put in your path, by arranging business finance or commercial finance for you in a time-saving and more efficient manner.  
ASC have been established for over forty years and we have experienced more recessions and ups and downs in the economy then we care to remember. Due to our clear focus on independent businesses and entrepreneurs we have developed a track record which is envied by our competitors. You will deal directly with an experienced Director who has a strong commercial background and real experience enabling him or her to find the business finance which is just right for your business.

The Ten Reasons


1. A Refreshingly Personal Service
We offer straight and direct communication with an experienced director. We won’t treat you like a form filling robot and squeeze you through a call centre. You will always have a personal contact to speak to as and when you want to. Where else can you still get this?


2. Finance Brokers with a Track Record for Success
                        Our record speaks for itself, with over 40 years’ experience in successfully arranging business finance. But don’t just take our word for it - see what our clients have to say about us!
                    

3. We Understand Small Businesses
                        We know that every small business is unique. That’s why you can deal with an experienced business person, who is able to understand what is important for you and your business, in order to arrange the right finance for you.
                    

4. Direct Access to Lenders and Terms
                        Your time is precious, and you have better things to do than getting frustrated by running around from lender to lender. Our job is to remove the ever increasing hurdles imposed on you by lenders.
                    

5. ASC Take the Hassle out of Business Finance
                        We offer straight and direct communication with an experienced director. We won’t treat you like a form filling robot and squeeze you through a call centre. You will always have a personal contact to speak to as and when you want to. Where else can you still get this?
                    

6. We’re on your Side, we are Independent
                        ASC are independent finance brokers. As experienced professionals, we don’t work for the banks, we work for you - our success is aligned with your success.
                    

7. Local Service - National Strength
                        You benefit from both the local director’s dedicated personal attention and the support of the central unit. Your local bank manager has disappeared – but ASC are still here.
                    

8. Coordination with your Professional Advisors
                        We co-ordinate our work with all your professional advisors, from solicitors to valuers and lenders. Whilst we focus on organizing finance, you can focus on what is important to you: developing and operating your business.
                    

9. ASC are Highly Recommended
                        We enjoy many important endorsements. You can relax, knowing that you have the benefit of dealing with a market leader, with a successful track record of arranging business finance.
                    

10. Nothing but Business Finance
                        We only work in business finance – nothing else. Our job is simply to arrange finance which works for you: Sensible Finance for Sensible Deals at Sensible Rates!
