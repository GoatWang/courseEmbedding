UNL Fund Description
The United States 12 Month Natural Gas Fund holds the 12 nearest-month NYMEX natural gas futures contracts in equal weights.
  
UNL FactSet Analytics Insight
Note: The issuer has temporarily suspended creations for this fund as of Mar 22, 2016 pending the filing of new paperwork with the SEC. This action could create unusual or excessive premiums— an increase of the market price of the fund relative to its fair value. Redemptions are not affected. Trade with care; check iNAV vs. price.UNL offers an alternative method of exposure to natural gas in a viable, if not quite bulletproof, vehicle. The fund spreads its futures exposure equally across the nearest 12 contract months in an effort to minimize the impact of contango on returns. In contrast, our benchmark—as well as UNL's sister fund UNG—offers exposure to the next-nearest month. This approach has generally helped returns over the past 12 months, and our forward estimate of decay suggests that that may continue going forward. The fund has enough assets to lower its risk of closure. UNL can be fairly traded with some effort: Use limit orders to manage spreads. UNL's legal structure isn't at all unusual in the commodities space, but it does change the tax structure and result in a K-1 at tax time.
