Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Davis earned Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts (History, 1969) degrees from Sonoma State University. For many years, he was editor and publisher of Civil War Times Illustrated and lived in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.
Career[edit]




Davis orating in 2009.


Davis's expertise on Confederate and southern U.S. history has made him a valued consultant for newspaper articles[3] as well as television productions, including the Arts & Entertainment Network/History Channel series "Civil War Journal".[1]
Davis served as a consultant for the creation of a United States postage stamp of Jefferson Davis and has had input into the formation of the Museum of the Civil War in Petersburg, Virginia.[1]
1990s
He was awarded the Sonoma State University Distinguished Alumni Award in 1993.[4] He is a past president of the National Historical Society.
In 1996, Davis authored the book The Cause Lost: Myths and Realities of the Confederacy, a critical examination of mythical claims made by neo-Confederates and Lost Cause members regarding the Confederacy and the American Civil War. Davis states that "it is impossible to point to any other local issue but slavery and say that Southerners would have seceded and fought over it."[5] However, Davis contrasted the motivations of the Confederate regime with that of the motivations for individual men for fighting in the Confederate army, writing that "The widespread northern myth that the Confederates went to the battlefield to perpetuate slavery is just that, a myth. Their letters and diaries, in the tens of thousands, reveal again and again that they fought and died because their Southern homeland was invaded and their natural instinct was to protect home and hearth."[6]
2000s
In 2000, Davis became a professor at Virginia Tech, where he serves as director of programs for the Virginia Center for Civil War Studies.[1] He retired from this position in 2013.[7]

Description












                                            In 1810 the wilds of West Floridatoday parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama, as well as Florida's panhandlewere populated by a mix of former British colonials, Spanish royalists, and American frontier settlers. Britain had ceded the territory to Spain, but in the Napoleonic era Spain's increasing mismanagement of the region impelled a band of American settlers, led by boatman and storekeeper Reuben Kemper and his brothers, to institute a vigilante force, revolt against Spain, and draft their own constitution. Peopled throughout with such lively and enterprising figures, this book by the author of The Pirates Laffite is a colorful history of a forgotten rebellion. By the time President Madison sent troops to occupy the territory after the Louisiana Purchase, the independent Republic of West Florida had already been in existence for 78 days."A significant study of an obscure but highly revealing moment in American history.... Not only does [William] Davis cast a bright light into these murky corners of our national past, he does so with a grace and clarity equal to the best historical writing today."Kirkus Reviews (starred review)

Description












(Winner of the American Civil War Museum's Jefferson Davis Prize and a Main Selection of the History Book Club) Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee met in person only four times, yet as the commanders of their respective armies they determined the outcome of America's most divisive war and cast larger-than-life shadows over their reunited nation. William Davisan advisor to the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Commission and a senior consultant for the History Channel's Civil War Journalwon an unprecedented fourth Jefferson Davis Prize for this remarkable double biography of Grant and Lee. They were from vastly different backgroundsLee, the melancholy realist, came from a distinguished family of waning fortunes, while Grant, the incurable optimist, was a young man on the make in a new Americayet they became almost indistinguishable in their battlefield instincts, attitudes, and skills in command."Dual biographies are famously difficult to pull off, but William C. Davis has done it with panache. His research in previously unexploited sources reveals new information and insights on both Grant and Lee. With narrative skill that shifts the focus back and forth between the two generals, Davis builds the tension as their careers converge toward the climax at Appomattox. Here we have something genuinely new in Civil War scholarship."James M. McPherson"There are many volumes contrasting Lee and Grant, but William C. Davis has gone far beyond the typical wartime comparisons. This beautifully written and wonderfully entertaining study falls right into line with his other excellent works, and the side-by-side comparisons of the lives and growth of Lee and Grant offer far more than the usual examination of Civil War strategy. This is a surprisingly fresh addition to any Civil War library."Jeff Shaara
