Helping you achieve your goals


Financial planning* typically encompasses a number of critical areas, including retirement planning, estate planning, insurance, tax planning, investment management, cash management and budgeting. Depending on client needs, it may also include education funding, charitable and planned giving, trust management and planning for long-term care.
Planning for the future can seem overwhelming at times because there are so many options to consider. However, if we start by answering some basic questions, the answers to those questions will then create a foundation on which to base sound financial planning decisions going forward.
* Please Note: The scope of the planning services to be provided depends upon the needs of the client and the terms of the engagement.

401k’s
Trust your employees’ future to Ifrah.
Ifrah Financial Services is one of the area’s leading financial planning and investment management firms. Our primary focus is retirement planning, so your employees will receive the benefit of our many years of experience.
Through our affiliation with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, Ifrah Financial is able to offer our clients high-quality, cost-effective retirement plans for their employees.
Our experts will introduce the plan to your employees, then work to maintain and increase participation. Your responsibilities will be clearly outlined and flexible enough so that you can maintain as much or as little control as you’d like.
By partnering with Ifrah, you are offering your employees access to the expertise and services of a Registered Investment Advisor and access to Certified Financial Planners®. This important opportunity might otherwise never have been available to them.


Vanguard: Outperforming the industry
Over the past decade, 92% of Vanguard funds outperformed their peer averages. And, while past performance does not guarantee future results, it does show you that Vanguard is among the smartest choices you can make.
Forbes magazine agrees. In June 2013, 16 Vanguard ETFs® made Forbes’ list of best ETFs for investors.
Best of all, these well-regarded funds come at a much lower cost. Vanguard funds consistently cost as little as one-fifth the industry average. Why?
Well, Vanguard isn’t your typical investment company. Every investor is a client- owner. Your employees will own the funds. And those funds own Vanguard. So with no stockholders or outside owners to answer to, the funds run at cost. The end result is that you and your employees will get to keep more of the returns.


A benefit for you…and your employees.
A 401k Plan allows you and your employees to share in the funding of a retirement savings plan. Your employees determine how much they want to save for their retirement and you determine how much you’ll contribute. The benefits are substantial, including:

Low initial setup costs
Low internal costs
Tax deduction on contributions and administrative costs
Excellent recruitment tool for new employees
Fee and information transparency
Our plans are proven to pass compliance testing


Your employees will enjoy:


Control over their retirement
Tax-deferred growth of retirement funds
Age-based investment options
Customizable portfolios
Low internal fees
Access to Certified Financial Planners®
Easy-to-use online account access


Get started.
Once you decide to establish a 401k with Ifrah, most of your work is done. You’ll then get a complete turnkey package of services, which requires minimal involvement on your part. You – and your employees – will get the coordinated benefit of highly specialized, trained professionals. All backed by two trusted industry names – Ifrah Financial and Vanguard Investments.

Financial Planning / The ProcessHome » Financial Planning / The Process









Our role is to sit down with our clients and go through these questions so that, together, we can understand where the client wants to go financially and how they can best get there.
Personal financial planning helps the client reach those goals through the development and proper management of their financial resources.
Financial planning is not a product… it is a process. With the assistance of a planner, clients may use specific financial products, but only as ends to accomplish the goals they have established.
The financial planning process is a series of steps taken to help clients accomplish their goals. A qualified financial planner, such as a Certified Financial Planner® professional, will first gather and analyze data about a client’s income and expenses, taxes, insurance coverage, retirement plans, wills, trusts, investments and other information pertinent to the overall financial situation.
The planner will then help the client set realistic goals, identify key financial issues concerning these goals, and prepare a list of recommendations and alternative strategies for achieving these goals. Each strategy, from tax planning to investments, will be recommended in the context of other strategies to achieve the optimum overall results.
Once the client has decided which recommendations to follow, the planner will help them implement those decisions. The last step in the financial planning process is to periodically review and, if necessary, revise the plan.
