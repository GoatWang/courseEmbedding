Make Your

Mark

We know every student by name and are proud of our culture of teamwork, impact and leadership that joins together all students, faculty and global alumni.




Life at Tepper

Among the advantages of attending a school with a tight-knit community is the lifetime friendships and high levels of networking available throughout the school, as well as throughout the global alumni network.
We are a community whose foundation is collaboration. The Tepper School offers a higher standard of community by offering campus-wide access to a curriculum in which team projects are inherently built into the academic and leadership experience. Our community thrives because each person understands the value of partnership. Our DNA is marked by curiosity and a keen interest in exploring different ways to solve problems that matter.
Successful students are those who have leadership potential and understand that true leadership is earned. This is why every Tepper School student is given the opportunity to make his or her mark in leadership roles via our 30-plus professional and social student clubs. Students also can participate in our student government — the Graduate Business Association, which the Dean's Office and key operating units serve as advisors for, providing support to the school's masters programs by encouraging visiting executives and CEOs to present to the school.
The school’s student clubs spearhead an impressive roster of year-round events, including global career treks, international cultural tours (often occurring over spring break to Africa, South America and Asia) and a robust set of case competitions that continue our students’ winning performance at national case and venture competitions.
Our students make their mark on our community with our annual Community Day event, in which students donate their time to philanthropic projects in nearby neighborhoods.
The social side of student life is discovered in the special neighborhoods and parks surrounding Pittsburgh and the 100-acre, lush Carnegie Mellon campus. The city has been receiving a lot of attention over the years as events, such as the G20 International Economic Forum and the prestigious, triennial Carnegie International, chose Pittsburgh for their locations. 
The region offers something for everybody with its recreational options:

An overwhelming amount of green spaces with 200 miles of biking, hiking and running paths are all a short distance way from campus.
Cultural and family-friendly destinations, such as amusement parks, shopping and night life. 
A Cultural District boasting five theaters that showcase some of the world’s most respected symphony, ballet, theater and opera companies.

Pittsburgh has a lot to offer. Become a Tepper School and Carnegie Mellon student, and find out just how great our city is!

Retired Broward School Teacher

“I was delighted when my attorney Mark Tepper told me that we had won my claim. It proves that the ‘little guy’ can win too, when taking on big institutions.”
– a retired Broward school teacher whose claim for damages against Merrill Lynch was upheld by a FINRA arbitrator who awarded compensatory damages, pre-judgment interest, expert fees, attorney’s fees to be determined by the court, and reimbursement of the filing fee. Merrill Lynch had recommended BreitBurn Energy Partners LP. [OTCMKTS: BBEPQ].

Can you sue your broker?

“As an attorney for investors I enjoy the satisfaction of doing the right thing. I meet people whose lives have been dramatically changed because of broker misconduct; and a successful claim and recovery can give them back their lives. That’s my reason for doing what I do.” – Securities Fraud Attorney Mark A. Tepper.
Seniors, who frequently are on fixed incomes and depend heavily on investments, can become targets for aggressive money managers promising higher returns through alternative investments.
“Investors should be very wary of aggressive financial advisors who promise stellar returns on investments, while pushing high-fee financial products where commissions and excessive trading can eventually drain a portfolio,” Mr. Tepper advises.
If a broker does not tell you the full story, gives false information or recommends something that isn’t right for you, then that could be misconduct. As a consumer, be alert for and recognize “red flags,” such as unexpected losses in your account. Ask your broker how he or she is compensated, and what are the costs and risks associated with your broker’s recommendations.
Breitburn Energy Partners LP
For example, investors who were inappropriately recommended oil and gas investments like Breitburn Energy Partners LP may be eligible to file claims for recovery against their broker.
Don’t be afraid to ask questions or to expect answers. If the given explanation doesn’t make sense to you, get another opinion.

Disciplinary and Other Actions Announced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)




FINRA disciplinary action has been taken against the following firms and individuals for violations of FINRA rules; federal securities laws, rules and regulations; and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB).
FINRA disciplinary action – Procedures
FINRA disciplinary action is taken through two separate procedures: a settlement or a formal complaint. With a settlement, a firm or broker can opt to settle with FINRA and sign an Accept, Waiver and Consent form (AWC). A formal complaint is filed with and heard before FINRA’s Office of Hearing Officers. The office assigns to the case a professional hearing officer who is responsible for ensuring the complaint is resolved fairly and expeditiously. The case is heard by a three-person panel made up of the hearing officer and two industry panelists.
“FINRA disciplinary action and the FINRA misconduct disclosure process are essential to informing customers about potential problem brokers and supervision breakdowns at brokerage firms,” Attorney Mark Tepper who represents investors seeking recovery against stockbroker fraud said.

Hedge-fund billionaire David Tepper joins Warren Buffett on the list of high-profile investors who are bullish on equities. Tepper told CNBC on Monday that he remains optimistic stocks will continue their ascent.

Investors tend to buy stocks in an atmosphere of rising risk appetite and they often purchase bonds when fear takes hold, driving buyers to the perceived safety of havens like government-backed debt.   Read: How to make sense of the conflicting signals stocks and bonds are sending investors Tepper appeared to attribute the simultaneous buying in stocks and bonds to central banks, which have been trying to foster growth in regions like Japan and Europe for years. “Could be there’s too much monetary policy still around the globe? Reaction in markets suggests it’s affecting the bond market more,” he told CNBC.

Market participants seem to be more comfortable with the brisk pace of records that stocks have managed to achieve since President Donald Trump emerged victorious in the November election. His promises of business friendly policies, including tax reform, and fiscal stimulus like infrastructure spending have been the backbone of the market’s recent rise. A recent article in The Wall Street Journal makes the argument that stocks are frothy but not in a bubble, but things could come tumbling down if Trump fails to deliver on his promises to Wall Street. The president’s speech in front a joint session of Congress on Tuesday may offer more details around his plans, which have been light thus far.

How to Fix Wall Street, and Bankers' Pay

Wall Street's 'fear gauge'--the VIX--just logged its second-lowest close in history
              
              One measure of fear on Wall Street on Friday booked its second-lowest finish ever, according to FactSet data. The CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, wrapped up the session down 2.3% at 9.36, marking the lowest close since the so-called "fear gauge" ended at 9.31 in December 1993 at 9.31. The gauge flirted with the lowest reading in history at 9.30, before bucking up a touch. The VIX is based on options contracts on the S&P 500 30-days in the future. The metric's historical average is 20 and it has continued to mostly slump in 2017, with the majority of its readings below 10 being put in this year, as stocks have reached repeated records since President Donald Trump's Election Day victory in November. That dynamic, lower readings for VIX and elevated stock prices, have suggested to market participants that investors are becoming increasingly complacent. Friday's VIX slide came as many major equity benchmarks closed lower, but not far from records, including the Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index , and the Nasdaq Composite Index , which all finished less than 1% shy of all-time closing highs.

U.S. to drop charges against ex-J.P. Morgan traders in London Whale case
              
              The U.S. government on Friday dropped charges against two former derivatives traders at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. --Javier Martin-Artajo and Julien Groupt--in the London Whale case, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. The U.S. decided not to pursue the charges after it determined that it can no longer rely on the testimony of Bruno Iksil, a former colleague of the defendants. Iksil was one of the several at J.P. Morgan that were involved in a trading debacle that resulted in over $6 billion in losses for the bank. London Whale was a nickname given to Iksil by his competitors.

U.S. stocks close lower as shaky GE outlook ends week
              
              U.S. stocks closed lower Friday, with the Dow industrials finishing lower for the week, as General Electric Co.'s  outlook cast a cloud over earnings season, which is just getting started. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 31.71 points, or 0.2%, to close at 21,580.07, with shares of GE falling 2.9% and shares of Chevron Corp.  and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.  helping to lead blue chips lower. For the week, the Dow finished 0.3% lower, snapping a two-week win streak. The S&P 500 index  declined 0.91 point to close at 2,472.54, with five out of 11 sectors finishing lower, led by declines in energy and industrials. The index logged a 0.5% gain for the week, for a third week of gains. The Nasdaq Composite Index  closed down 2.25 points at 6,387.75. The tech-heavy index finished up 1.2% for the week for a third week of gains.
