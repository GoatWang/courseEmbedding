Lives Saved

*Over 180,000 and counting...





“By the grace of God, I had my Taser. As soon as he saw it, he jumped out of the car and ran off. I was horrified at the thought of what could have happened, but I was also so thankful that my Taser scared him away and I was safe.” 



“Ever since I got my Taser Pulse, I don't worry about creepers when I'm out at night or on runs by myself. If anyone thinks I'm vulnerable, they're confused! Don't mess with me!”



“I love my Taser! I have class late at night and it is so comforting knowing I have my Taser if I ever needed to protect myself when I am alone on campus. It is light, easy to use, and gives me the extra level of security I need.”














Mission

Our mission is to protect life. It's that simple. We envision a world with less assaults, less violence, and less worry. One that's safer, bolder. Where anyone can live their life fearlessly.

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]

Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]

Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.

Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

TASER International Inc.: The Bear Case From a Bull
The smart weapons and body camera company has a bright future, but it could fall apart if a few big risks go wrong.

In any investment it's important to understand both the bull and bear argument. With TASER International Inc. (NASDAQ:AAXN), I've been firmly on the bull bandwagon for a while now. But there's a case to be made by investors who are more bearish on the company's future. Here are the best arguments against buying TASER International's stock today. 
Body camera competition is more formidable than it appears
TASER International has the largest market share in Tasers and body cameras by a long shot, but it isn't the only player in the game. In the past year, Safariland's Vievu has emerged as a formidable competitor with improving body cameras and even a cloud-based video management system. The Safariland Group is already a large supplier of holsters, tactical gear, body armor, and many other products to the law enforcement community, so adding body cameras to the mix is a natural fit. 
Motorola has also entered the body camera market, although it hasn't made as big a splash as investors once feared. And then there are players like Wolfcom, WatchGuard, and L3 Mobile-Vision that have offerings that could gain market share in the body camera market. 
Financially, the risk is that competitors will try to win contracts by underbidding TASER's Axon body camera system. We've already seen the NYPD choose Vievu because it offered a lower price, so there's a lot of margin risk if competitors get aggressive in the market.

Running a race it'll never win
The competition in body cameras means TASER International has to constantly improve its products to stay a step ahead. Recently, that's meant increasing image quality and cloud services. A partnership in wireless connectivity last year and two acquisitions in AI early in 2017 give us a clue as to where management sees the body camera products heading in the future. But it's not clear whether those moves would be valued by customers if they bring more advanced features than competitive products. 
It's possible that there's nothing sustainable about any competitive advantage that TASER International builds into body cameras, or Tasers, and competitors will just be able to copy features and make a product that meets customers' needs. This would eat away at pricing power and market share. If products themselves become commoditized, it would be terrible for TASER International's bottom-line growth prospects. 





International investments won't pay off
Over the last three years, TASER International has made a huge investment in growing its international sales force. SG&A spending has grown 118% in that time compared to 89% growth in revenue, so the investment is clearly taking away from net income potential, but the theory is that it will pay off with higher profits down the road. 

TASR SG&A Expense (TTM) data by YCharts.
The bear case is that TASER International won't be able to make a profit on these investments, and international markets will either choose competitors or forgo buying body cameras and Tasers. 
What management is really doing is investing a lot in new products and sales capabilities today, hoping for a high return on that investment in the future. But what if it never comes? That would be terrible for TASER International stock.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

SCOTTSDALE, AZ--(Marketwire - Jul 26, 2012) - TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TASR), today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012 ended June 30, 2012.
Financial Summary:

Net sales were $28.2 million in the quarter, an increase of $7.0 million or 33.1% compared to second quarter 2011 sales of $21.2 million. The increase in sales versus the prior year was primarily driven by the extended upgrade program for the TASER® X2™ Electronic Control Device (ECD), as well as a significant order from an international customer in Brazil. 
Gross margin in the second quarter of 2012 was 58.5%, compared to 57.8% in the same period last year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by the increase in sales as well as an absence of expenses relating to a discontinued product line which was impaired in the second quarter of 2011.
Revenues in the ECD business segment increased 8% sequentially, from $24.8 million in the first quarter of 2012 to $26.9 million in the second quarter of 2012.
Revenues in the video business segment increased 47% sequentially, from $884K in the first quarter of 2012 to $1.3 million in the second quarter of 2012.
Operating income of $6.1 million benefited from the continued decrease in consulting and lobbying expenses and reduction in depreciation expense as a result of writing down the X3 and AXON product lines in Q4 2011. 
Sales, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses of $8.4 million in the second quarter of 2012 decreased approximately $0.7 million compared to the second quarter of 2011 due to ongoing cost reduction efforts.
Research and development (R&D) expenses decreased $0.8 million to $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2012 when compared to the second quarter of 2011. The decrease was primarily attributable to the continued reduction in professional and consulting fees.
Adjusted operating income, which excludes the impact of stock-based compensation charges, depreciation and amortization and one-time litigation judgment expenses, was $8.4 million for the second quarter of 2012, a significant increase from an adjusted operating income of $1.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. GAAP income from operations was $6.1 million for the quarter, compared to a loss from operations of approximately $5.0 million for the second quarter of 2011.
Net income for the second quarter of 2012 was $3.4 million, or $0.06 per share on a basic and diluted basis. 
In the second quarter of 2012, the Company generated $9.7 million in cash from operating activities. The Company generated $13.4 million in cash from operating activities in the first half of 2012. 
Cash, cash equivalents and investments were $23.2 million at the end of the second quarter of 2012, after executing $16.1 million of stock repurchases during the quarter. The Company has no debt recorded on its balance sheet.
"Our momentum remained strong this quarter as the extended upgrade program of the X2 ECD encouraged further deployment across various law enforcement agencies and drove greater than thirty percent year-over-year top-line growth in our business," commented Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International, Inc. "Further, tighter cost controls, improving expense discipline and higher sales all helped the Company deliver a second consecutive quarter of strong operating results and resulted in significant cash generation of more than $9.7 million from operations. We continue to believe that we are well positioned to deliver on the execution of our strategy, while driving profitable growth and value for all of our stakeholders." 
Other Significant Events: 

The Company continued to see adoption of the new X2 ECD platform by agencies through its extended upgrade program. The Company announced a number of significant orders that occurred during the second quarter, which included: 

Breon Enterprises of Australia (AUS) purchased 775 X2 ECDs with 475 TASER CAM™ HD cameras in addition to X26 ECDs, TASER CAM audio recorders, TASER Cartridges and related accessories. 
The Oregon State Police (OR) purchased 454 X2 ECDs as a full deployment to their patrol, fish and wildlife troopers.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol (OH) purchased 485 X26 ECDs. 
The Austin Police Department (TX) purchased 100 X26 ECDs with extended warranties and related accessories. 
The Company began shipping the new TASER AXON™ Flex™ on-officer camera and EVIDENCE.com management service in May. A number of new agencies adopted the platform during the second quarter including: 

The Mesa Police Department (AZ) ordered 50 AXON Flex cameras with one year of EVIDENCE.com. 
The Terrebonne Parish Sheriff's Office (LA) ordered 20 AXON Flex cameras with three years of EVIDENCE.com. 
The Modesto Police Department (CA) ordered 131 AXON Flex cameras with one year of EVIDENCE.com. 
The Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Police (CA) expanded their initial order from the first quarter to a full deployment with a total of 220 AXON Flex units with three years of EVIDENCE.com. 
On April 25, 2012 the Board of Directors of TASER authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $20 million of its common stock, reflecting the company's strong balance sheet and free-cash-flow generation. Repurchases may take place from time to time on the open market and are subject to market and business conditions. As of June 30, 2012 the Company has repurchased 5.6% of shares outstanding totaling 3,113,806 shares of stock costing approximately $16.1 million. In the past eighteen months, the Company has repurchased a total of 10,578,389 shares or 16.9% of the total shares outstanding at the start of the buyback programs. At June 30, 2012 the Company had 52,830,153 shares outstanding. 
Outlook:
"As we move forward into the second half of the year, we remain encouraged by the continued traction we are seeing with the adoption of the X2, both in the domestic and international markets," commented Rick Smith, CEO of TASER International, Inc. "The X2 product line witnessed more than 120% revenue growth sequentially in the second quarter and our pipeline and sales conversations remain robust. Law enforcement agencies remain eager to harness the new technology of the X2 and want to take advantage of our generous trade-in program to upgrade their existing X26 devices. Further, we are also seeing highly encouraging market reaction to the new AXON Flex video system which anchored a 46% sequential increase in revenue for our video business. Mid-size agencies like BART and Modesto Police Departments moved to full deployment of the devices to every officer within weeks of the product shipping. We are also seeing significant interest in the major cities, with the Mesa Police Department and the Fort Worth Police Department making initial deployments of fifty units each. We look forward to the accelerating traction of AXON Flex, as well as the EVIDENCE.COM service over the coming quarters."

Non-GAAP Measures 
To supplement the Company's Statements of Operations presented in accordance with GAAP, we are presenting non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. We have presented these measures for our investors to be better able to compare our current results with those of previous periods and have shown a reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures in the tables at the end of this release. These non-GAAP measures include the impact of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, litigation judgment expense, asset impairment charges and loss on write down of Property and Equipment. We use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenses and expenditures that may not be indicative of our "recurring core business operating results," meaning our operating performance excluding non-cash charges, such as stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and other discrete non-cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management's internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity. 
Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures
As noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the impact of other non-cash charges. Management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that: 

these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures; 
these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures; 
these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and 
these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles. 
Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies. 
A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.

TASER International, Inc.'s Biggest Win in 2016
One contract announced during 2016 showed that the investments TASER International has made in the last few years are paying off. 











                Travis Hoium
            

                (TMFFlushDraw)



            
            Jan 20, 2017 at 2:15PM
            
            





2016 was a remarkable year in a lot of ways for TASER International, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAXN), manufacturer of Tasers and body cameras for law enforcement. The company saw revenue and backlog surge as customers adopted less-lethal weapons and body cameras in response to public concerns about policing. 
The company's strategy for a few years now has been to build out its capability in both product lines in the U.S., and then expand internationally with a known product line. Body cameras in particular need to be proven out before law enforcement agencies around the world will begin using them, as does TASER's cloud platform Evidence.com. But we're seeing a lot of evidence that body cameras and cloud services will be big growth drivers in the future, and one contract in particular showed the company's progress in 2016. 

Image source: TASER International. 
Australia goes all-in on body cameras 
On July 20, 2016, TASER announced that the Queensland Police Service in Australia had agreed to buy 2,200 Axon Flex cameras (adding to 500 cameras purchased previously), plus a three-year subscription to Evidence.com. The order is notable for its size, outpacing a 1,015-unit order in Atlanta and a 2,031-unit order in Chicago, and for the fact that it gives TASER a foothold in a large international market. As I outlined above, international growth is really the key to making the business profitable and justifying investments made to build out the product line. 
It's not surprising that Australian and New Zealand police agencies also ordered 2,585 Taser Smart Weapons, announced earlier this month, building on the momentum. Body cameras and Tasers have gone hand in hand as law enforcement agencies look for more accountability and less-lethal options for doing their jobs. 
Orders in Australia may seem like business as usual, but they're an important expansion of the company's market potential -- and they're signs that years of investment are starting to pay off. 
Revenue growth is a leading indicator
If you're looking at TASER International's long-term potential in the stock market, it's important to understand how to read its financial statements. Management has been increasing investment in operating expenses -- sales and R&D staff -- to grow out the product line and expand the customer base around the world. This investment will result in a decline in net income in the short term, but we can see that it's working by the growth in revenue over the long term. 

TASR Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.
Another sign the strategy is working is growth in future contracted revenue. This is mostly Evidence.com contracts that are as long as five years and bring extremely high margins to the business. At the end of the third quarter, future contracted revenue was $302.0 million, up 90% from $159.0 million at the end of 2015. It's hard to find fault in those kind of growth numbers. 





A bright future is ahead
The long-term trends are working to help TASER International, and the company has shown plenty of evidence that it's leading with both its Taser and body camera product lines and that it's growing its market internationally. When combined with the growth that's just beginning to show from long-term Evidence.com contracts, the financial future of the company is bright. That's a great sign for long-term investors.

 Dummy CamerasDummy Cameras
Now you can deter robbery, theft, and vandalism with a dummy camera. Dummy cameras are non-functioning security cameras. However, they look just like real surveillance cameras. Three of our dummy cameras include a blinking red LED and operate on batteries. The dummy camera with housing and professional dummy camera have a fake power cable. These features make the dummy cameras almost exact replicas of the real cameras.

Dummy cameras are a low cost solution if you're not able to spend the money on a real 
surveillance camera. A dummy camera can also be a cheap way to add on to an existing surveillance system. Although dummy cameras won't catch a criminal, studies have shown that just the presence of a fake camera has prevented crimes like robbery, theft and vandalism.

 Select TASER Models 
The affordable and preferred non-lethal choice of most law enforcement agencies, private security and regular citizens













Gun-like non-lethal weapons, like the TASER devices, are often seen on Television or in the news where an officer has to subdue a person who is not complying with his verbal commands to stop and desist. The subject is often seen posing a threat to him or herself, or others, and has to be incapacitated for the safety of the officers or of others in the vicinity. TASER handheld weapons have been shown to be extremely effective in taking down even the most aggressive person.
 
Each ADVANCED TASER® gun model uses a replaceable cartridge unit, which employs compressed nitrogen to fire two barbed probes at 160 feet per second. These probes are connected to the weapon by high-voltage insulated wire. When the probes make contact with the target, the ADVANCED AIR TASER handgun transmits powerful electrical pulses along the wires and into the body of the target through up to two inches of clothing.

                       'Don't Tase Me Bro' Highlights Effectiveness Of Tasers
 
 
How Effective are TASER Weapons?
The new TASER C2/Bolt®, Pulse, X26P & X2 have almost a 100% effectiveness rating. These weapons combine the injury reducing benefits of traditional stun technology with a quantum leap in stopping power via new Neuromuscular Incapacitation (NMI) technology. In the newest police studies, the new Advanced TASER models had a higher instant incapacitation rate than a 9mm hand gun.
 
How Does a TASER work?
Each Taser gun come with a laser sighting and shoot out 2 darts attached to 15 feet of wire.  Only the Taser X2 can hold and fire two cartridges (4 probes) at once.  50,000 volts travels over the wires and over-rides the central nervous system providing incredible takedown power.
Which TASER is the Most Powerful?
The Advanced TASER X26-P is the most powerful, discharging 50,000 volts at 26 watts. The TASER Pulse and TASER Bolt discharge 50,000 volts at 7 watts, and the X2 discharges 50,000 volts at 25 watts. Please note that even though the Pulse and Bolt emit less wattage than the other models, it discharges 30 seconds of shock compared to 5 and 10 seconds of shock of the other models, therefore giving it the same disabling capabilities.
Can TASER devices really incapacitate an assailant?
Yes. TASER devices utilize "electro-muscular disruption (EMD)" technology. TASER devices use a powerful 50,000 volt electrical signal to completely override the central nervous system and directly control all muscles. This EMD effect causes an uncontrollable contraction of the muscle tissue, allowing the TASER device to physically debilitate a target regardless of pain tolerance or mental focus. TASER devices are specifically designed to stop even the most elite, aggressive, and focused combatants. Rather than simply interfering with communication between the brain and muscles, TASER EMD systems directly tell the muscles what to do, resulting in muscle spasms, until the target is in the fetal position on the ground. The TASER device provides for maximum safety for both the user and the assailant by bringing dangerous situations quickly under control before force escalates to lethal levels. There have been hundreds of reports that TASER devices disabled attackers and probably saved the owner's life.
How can the TASER device be so effective yet non-injurious?
The TASER device does not depend upon impact, pain or body penetration to achieve its effect. Its pulsating electrical output interferes with communication between the brain and the muscular system, resulting in loss of control. However, the TASER device is non-destructive to nerves, muscles and other body elements. It simply affects them in their natural mode. More importantly, no court of law has ever ruled that a death has ever been directly attributed to the TASER device.
Isn't high voltage lethal?
High voltage, in itself, is not dangerous. One can receive a 25,000-volt shock of static electricity from a doorknob on a dry day without harm. The physiological effect of electrical shock is determined by the current, its duration, and the power source that produces the shock. The typical household current of 110 volts is dangerous because it can pump many amperes of current throughout the body indefinitely. By contrast, the TASER device's power supply consists of batteries that are capable of supplying electrical power for a few minutes, but will not kill the assailant.
What are the after effects?
A person hit with a TASER device will feel dazed for several minutes. The pulsating electrical output causes involuntary muscle contractions and a resulting sense of vertigo. It can momentarily stun or render an attacker unconscious, yet the TASER’s low electrical amperage and short duration of pulsating current, ensures a non-lethal charge. Moreover, it does not cause permanent damage or long-term aftereffects to muscles, nerves or other body functions. A January 1987 Annals of Emergency Medicine study reported TASER technology leaves no long term injuries compared with 50% long term injuries for gunshot injuries.
Must the probes penetrate the body to be effective?
No. The electrical current will "jump" up to two inches as long as both probes are attached to clothing or skin. At most, only the 3/8-inch needlepoint/hook will penetrate the skin. They have less energy than a spring propelled BB.
What if the probe misses?
The TASER device can be used in a touch-stun mode. The user is thus provided with a final backup if the probes miss the target. Should the user miss or engage a second attacker, he can touch the unit directly to the target and it will work like a powerful touch-stun device.
Are TASERS safe to use, even if you've never shot a weapon?
Taser guns are one of the best, safest and most effective options for personal protection and home defense. The technologically advanced Taser C2/Bolt, Pulse, P & X Series Taser gun models are non-lethal weapons that are designed for both men and women to meet their self defense product needs. Utilizing the same technology as our proven law enforcement models, they offer incredible take down power and self defense protection right in the palm of your hand. Check out our affordable Taser sale price and buy a taser online today.

TASER conducted electrical weapons are not considered firearms and are legal to carry in most states without permits. Restricted from consumer use in MA, RI, NY, NJ, HI, District of Columbia, and certain cities and counties. Buyer is responsible for researching and knowing the applicable state and local laws prior to purchasing, possessing, transporting or using a TASER CEW.  Full legal reference here

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

Axon (formerly TASER International) is a Scottsdale, Arizona-based company which develops products for the law enforcement market.
Its flagship product and former namesake is Taser, a line of electroshock weapons. The company has since diversified into technology products for law enforcement, including body cameras and digital evidence solutions; as of 2017, body cameras and associated services comprise a quarter of Axon's overall business.[1]

History[edit]
In 1969, NASA researcher Jack Cover began to develop a non-lethal electric weapon to help police officers control suspects, as an alternative to firearms.[2] By 1974, Cover had completed the device, which he named the "Tom Swift Electric Rifle" (TSER), referencing the novel Tom Swift and his Electric Rifle. To make it easier to pronounce as a word, Cover later added an "A" to the acronym to form "TASER".[3] The Taser Public Defender used gunpowder as its propellant, which led the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to classify it as a firearm in 1976.[4][5] This limited sales and Cover's company, Taser Systems Inc., collapsed.[6]
In 1991, Rick and Tom Smith formed AIR TASER, Inc. to, with Cover, design a version of the device that would use compressed nitrogen instead of gunpowder as a propellant.[7] The pursuit began after two of Rick's former high school acquaintances had been murdered in a road rage incident in Scottsdale.[6][8][7] During development, the company faced competition from another vendor, Tasertron, whose product had become associated with its alleged ineffectiveness during the police confrontation of Rodney King.[9]
After nearly going bankrupt marketing other products such as an electroshock-based anti-theft system for automobiles known as "Auto Taser",[10] the company, later re-named TASER International, introduced its TASER M26 weapon in 1999.[9] With a $6.8 million deficit in 2001, TASER International took steps to improve sales by offering to pay police officers to train others on how to use their products; this marketing technique helped improve the company's market share, reaching $24.5 million in net sales by 2003, and nearly $68 million in 2004.[9] In May 2001, they filed for an initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the stock symbol TASR.[citation needed]
The company also took significant action against competitors, having acquired the aforementioned Tasertron, and aggressively defending its patents. Patent lawsuits by TASER International led to the shutdown of both Stinger Systems and its successor company, Karbon Arms; both companies were founded by Robert Gruder. Despite the controversies that have centered around the products (including deaths attributed to taser usage), the company maintained its dominant market position.[11]
Shift towards bodycams[edit]
In 2005, TASER International began to offer an accessory for its taser products, TASER Cam, which adds a grip-mounted camera that is activated after the safety is disengaged, to its battery pack. By October 2010, at least 45,000 TASER Cams had been sold.[12][13]
In 2008, the company unveiled its first body camera, the Axon Pro. It was designed to be head-mounted, and upload footage for online storage on a web-based service known as Evidence.com. TASER's CEO Rick Smith explained that the products were designed to "help provide revolutionary digital evidence collection, storage and retrieval for law enforcement".[14] The company piloted Axon Pro in various small cities and towns.[14] In 2009, after prosecutor Daniel Shue exonerated Fort Smith police officer Brandon Davis based on footage from an Axon Pro camera, TASER's marketing began to incorporate testimonials by both parties into marketing for the Axon line.[14]
Especially in the wake of the Michael Brown shooting, the company's body camera business saw significant growth. Smith argued that the company was "not just about weapons, but about providing transparency and solving related data problems."[10] In April 2013, the Rialto Police Department released the results of a 12-month study on the impact of on-officer video using Axon Flex cameras. The study found an 88% drop in complaints filed against officers and nearly a 60% reduction in officer use-of-force incidents.[15]
TASER opened an office in Seattle in 2013,[16] and an international office in Amsterdam, Netherlands in May 2014.[17] In June 2015, the company announced the formation of a new Seattle-based division named after the Axon brand, which would encompass the company's technology businesses, including body cameras, digital evidence management, and analytics. Rick Smith explained that the branch was inspired by Microsoft's use of the Xbox brand to branch into entertainment businesses, stating that "Axon was the name that we used for selling cameras historically, but we realized that brand had the room to grow and encompass all of our connected technologies." The Taser brand would still be used for the company's weapons products.[18][19]
On April 5, 2017, TASER International announced that it had been re-named Axon to reflect its diversification. The company also announced an intent to offer free one-year trials of its body camera products and Evidence.com services to U.S. law enforcement agencies. While the Taser product line still contributes to a significant portion of Axon's revenue, the company's technologies business has seen major gains;[20] as of 2017, Axon's body cameras have been adopted by police departments in 85% of the United States' major cities, and comprise a quarter of the company's business.[1] Smith noted that the "Taser" name had garnered a negative stigma (especially among members of the public that have "negative views of police") due to its association with the weapons, and that when recruiting employees, he noted that there were times "when we're talking about cameras and cloud software that talking about Taser weapon issues can be a bit of a distraction."[1]
Hardware[edit]
Taser[edit]
Main article: Taser
Law enforcement models[edit]
There are two primary law enforcement models currently available:

TASER X26P: An all-digital, single-shot electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.
TASER X2: An all-digital, two-shot capacity electrical weapon for law enforcement personnel.

Consumer models[edit]
In addition to the law enforcement models, the company also offers devices to civilians and private security, including the TASER Pulse, C2, X26C, X2, and Strikelight.[citation needed]
Body cameras[edit]
Axon Pro[edit]
Taser's original body-worn camera, the Axon Pro, was introduced in 2009.[10] The camera consists of three components, a head-mounted camera, a controller, and a monitor to review video recordings.[21]
Second-generation models[edit]
The second generation of Axon body cameras were simpler in form and function than the Axon Pro, removing the bulky monitor in favor of pairing with mobile phones. Many of the features introduced in these cameras,[22] such as the pre-event buffer, a method of capturing video from before the record button was pressed, have become common requirements in body-worn camera requests for proposal. The Axon Flex and Body only record video in standard definition (SD).

Axon Flex: The Axon Flex, a point-of-view camera, was released in 2012. The Flex camera system consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. In contrast to the Axon Pro, the Axon Flex does not have a screen to play back video. Instead, Taser offers a mobile application (Axon View) that connects to the camera using Bluetooth. Like the previous model, Axon Flex videos are stored in Evidence.com, Taser's cloud-hosted evidence management system. The camera features multiple mounting options, including a mount for Oakley, Inc.'s Flak Jacket® eyewear, in addition to collar, epaulette, ball cap, and helmet mounts.[23]
Axon Body: In 2013, Taser released the Axon Body, a single-unit camera similar in function to the Axon Flex. It features a wider field-of-view than the Flex, and also has simpler mounting options than the two-piece Flex. Although simpler, the body-mounted camera will not track what the officer is looking at as accurately as one mounted on the head.

Third-generation models[edit]

Axon Body 2: Redesigned and rebuilt on an Ambarella system-on-chip (SoC) video chip, the Axon Body 2 camera features full high-definition (HD) video, wireless activation, and other improvements over the original Body.
Axon Flex 2: The Axon Flex 2, announced October 11, 2016, is an upcoming point-of-view camera slated to begin shipments in December 2016.[24] Like its predecessor, the Flex 2 consists of a camera attached to an external battery pack / controller. The new camera will feature a wider field of view (120 degrees vs. the Flex's 75 degrees), HD video, and other improvements over the original model.

Other cameras[edit]
In addition to body-worn cameras, Axon also offers interview room and in-car video systems, known as Axon Interview and Axon Fleet respectively. These systems, like the body cameras, integrate with the Evidence.com service.[25][26]
Software[edit]
Evidence.com[edit]
Evidence.com is a cloud-based digital evidence management system that allows police departments to manage, review, and share digital evidence, particularly video evidence captured with Axon-branded cameras.[10] It includes an automated redaction tool, audit trails for chain of custody purposes, and functionality to share evidence with prosecutors and others.[27] A free version is offered specifically for prosecutors to receive and manage incoming digital evidence.[27]
Evidence Sync[edit]
Evidence Sync is a desktop application that allows law enforcement officers to review and upload evidence from hardware devices and local files. It is also used to upload logs from Taser weapons to Evidence.com. Although primarily intended to work with Evidence.com, it can also be used in offline mode to directly access files, if the agency prefers.
Axon mobile apps[edit]
Two mobile apps integrate with the Axon cameras and Evidence.com. Axon View can be paired with an Axon body camera to review, tag, and stream videos from the camera.[28] Axon Capture can be used to capture audio, photo, and video evidence and upload it to Evidence.com using an officer's mobile phone.[29]
Axon Signal[edit]
Axon Signal is a range of products that are designed to automatically trigger recordings on Axon cameras in response to certain events, such as Signal Vehicle (which can trigger after the opening of doors or activation of sirens), Signal Performance Power Magazine (a successor to the TASER Cam accessory that triggers recordings when an Taser is armed), and Signal Sidearm (a sensor for handgun holsters which triggers recording when the gun is removed).[30]
Controversies[edit]
Main article: Taser safety issues
The company has noted that it has lost two product liability lawsuits:

This lawsuit represents the fifty-ninth (59th) wrongful death or injury lawsuit that has been dismissed or judgment entered in favor of TASER International. This number includes a small number of police officer training injury lawsuits that were settled and dismissed in cases where the settlement economics to TASER International were significantly less than the cost of litigation. One of these cases is that on Feb. 15, 2006, one officer Officer accidentally discharged TASER device on his daughter.[31] TASER International has lost two product liability lawsuits.[32]

However, on June 6, 2008, the company lost its first product-liability suit.[33] The damages were reduced in the Court of Appeals in 2011.[34] TASER lost its second product liability suit [35] In late January 2008, the public safety committee of the current Canadian House of Commons launched an investigation into their use, after the death of Robert Dziekanski.[36] The coroner concluded that the death of Robert Dziekanski was a homicide, confirming that the Taser was the cause of death, and has the capacity to kill.[37] The British Columbia government's Braidwood Inquiry is also currently underway.
In 2008, CBC News found that TASER X26 models manufactured before 2005 had a faulty fail-safe system.[38]
In 2015, it was discovered that several TASER International employees, without mentioning their employment status, had left negative reviews on Amazon.com and iTunes Store for Killing Them Safely, a documentary film by Nick Berardini which is critical of the company. The film documents and investigates the major incidents that resulted from taser usage.[39][40][41]
In January 2016, TASER International was sued by Digital Ally for infringing its two U.S. patents on the automatic activation of law enforcement body cameras. TASER International considered the suit to be "frivolous and egregious".[42]
The Evidence.com terms of use gives the company a "transferable, irrevocable, royalty-free, sub-licensable, worldwide license" to use photos and videos uploaded by users. According to criminal defense lawyer, the terms of use go against the privacy of juveniles under Californian law.[43]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
