John C Rudolf's Experience
Title: Founder and Chief Executive Officer
               Company: Iron Empire Gallery
Job Details
               Iron Empire offers more than the most talked about professional equipment and peerless instructors. The space is enhanced by wall-to-wall mural art by New Hampshire artist Emily Sodders. All around this is a unique place. There are 2 murals painted throughout the interior, one of a lifter and another of a sprinter. The color and imagery give the atmosphere a "Fire and Ice" type of theme. The lifter is Franco Columbu, both a Champion Powerlifter and Bodybuilder and he has given his personal approval of this mural. Iron Empire has created space unlike other gyms. We provide the atmosphere and motivation to inspire you to reach further - to attain your personal goals. We welcome you to come in and see for yourself. Iron Empire has created space unlike other gyms. We provide the atmosphere and motivation to inspire you to reach further - to attain your personal goals.
Title: 
               Company: Elecyr Corporation
Job Details
               Elecyr offers power conversion electronics for converting high voltage AC power to DC for providing power directly from an AC generator or grid power to a high voltage bus for traction applications and for charging a high voltage DC battery bank. Elecyr supports systems in the 10kW to 400kW range. As the power increases, our systems are designed to stay in a range of 600A or less and 600 volts or less. Above this current level or voltage level, the cost of system components such as wiring and breakers escalates exponentially. Most of our requirements are for power conversion from three-phase AC at 220, 480 or 575 VAC at 50/60Hz or 400Hz. Variable frequency and variable voltage input is also acceptable within limits in applications where generated power is variable. The power conversion is accomplished using a three-phase SCR controller, utilizing advanced FPGA control logic to increase reliablility, circuit flexibility and to reduce component count. These converters are able to provide up to 200kW at 300 to 500 VDC. We also support applications such as telecom and server farms, where the battery standard is 48 volts supplied locally at lower current to individual server racks. In this case we provide conversion from 600 volt DC or AC, from large solar arrays or wind turbines to arrays of 48 volt DC batteries. These more conventional buck converters are optimized for up to 20kW for the localized conversion. We also offer packaged 48 volt energy modules including battery management for quick deployment and hot swap. Because of the variation in application requirements, Elecyr power conversion products are built to order. Contact our application engineers to find the best match for your particular application.
