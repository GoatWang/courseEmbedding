Testimonials | Law Office of Michael R. Cahill             Need help? Call me.  (702) 382-8202     Header NavigationTestimonialsIf I don’t provide excellent customer service, my clients don’t refer me to their friends and I lose my best source for new clients.  As such, I make every effort to provide expert advice, a product of the highest quality and effectiveness, and ongoing support, all for a reasonable flat fee.Over the past five years, I’ve been rewarded with positive reviews and recognition from SuperLawyers, Avvo, and Google for my expertise and client satisfaction.  Read on to see what my clients have to say about the experience you can expect from the Law Office of Michael R. Cahill:I was more than pleased with Mr. Cahill.  He is very professional and very helpful and he definitely put my mind at ease.  I would definitely use him again and recommend him and his staff to my friends and everybody. – Bridget F., Sun City Summerlin In February, 2015 I needed to do a restatement of my then 13-year-old living trust. In two short, efficient meetings with lawyer Mike Cahill, I achieved my objective. I found him to be highly knowledgeable about about the law’s implications for facilitating a smooth transfer of  my property. He was very responsive to my specific requests.  (The sequencing of my bequests was a bit unusual and required some special language. I also requested a particular formatting for the paper version of one of the documents.) In all respects, his work exceeded my expectations. For estate planning services in the Las Vegas area, I would recommend him highly. – Richard C., Las Vegas Both my wife and myself have great respect for Michael as our estate planning lawyer. As a young lawyer we found his professionalism to be 100%! Michael is prompt, to the point, efficient, reasonable in his fees and for us he was a good find. Thanks for all your good work Michael, you are a very nice person. – M & N Baradon, Las Vegas We are tremendously pleased in the way Michael Cahill assisted us in setting up our Living Trust. He is extremely professional and worked with us personally from beginning to end. Mr. Cahill was very easy to talk to, took the time to thoroughly answer the many questions we had, and he provided highly useful life examples and insight which helped us feel very comfortable in our choices. We HIGHLY recommend him. – Vern, Las Vegas Michael was wonderful to work with and he presented all the appropriate options that fit our family while preparing our living trust and will.  We appreciated that he was able to expedite the preparation of our documents prior to our trip out of the country, so we could travel with peace of mind that our children were taken care of if anything were to happen to us.  Thank you so much to Michael and your great team! – Kelly & Todd W., Las Vegas It has been an absolute pleasure having my trust done by Michael Cahill.  Michael engenders a great deal of confidence and integrity. It was also completed very quickly and at a very reasonable price. He, and his staff, took very good care of me.  It was well worth the drive across town! – Sylvia B., Henderson We were seeking some professional advice on estate planning.  My wife and I were thinking of doing it ourselves online.  After talking to some friends we quickly found out all the potential pitfalls from the “self-service” estate planning industry.  We feel very fortunate to have found Michael.  His professional experience guided us past all the “unknowns” that only a true, experienced professional would know.  He took time to answer all our questions in great detail so we could really see the clear picture while making important decisions. We are very happy with our decision to use Michael Cahill.  It was fast, easy and most important, we can sleep at night knowing our family is set up for the future the right way. – Craig and Erin T., North Las Vegas We went to see Michael Cahill for a living trust and found him to be patient and very informative. After explaining the different choices we had he was prompt with the completion of the trust and other documents. We were very satisfied with his work and highly recommend him. – John and Carolyn P., Sun City Summerlin We felt that we were dealing with a friend who would guide and direct us through the process. His interview of us as a mean of garnering information to tailor a trust document for our needs reflected his extensive background in this area and Mike’s anticipation of issues and his breadth of knowledge in this area of the law came across as extensive. He had many good suggestions and approaches that will simplify issues in the future and avoid legal complications. In addition, our family situation contained some unique circumstances that Mike was able to accommodate in the trust. Mike went through the various sections of the trust and explained each section to us in simplified terms. We feel comfortable with what we have set up, in that it accurately represents our wishes and future needs. The quality and expertise of our new trust document reflects his expertise in this area of the law. In addition to these comments on both the quality of his work and expertise in document preparation, we have a sense of personal commitment that Mike brought to these discussions. We both sensed a bonding of sorts that comes from his personality and notion of what could be called “customer service”. The overall process was relatively simple, easily accomplished and reasonably priced. It is without reservation that I would recommend him to my friends and family. – Jerry L., Las Vegas We were extremely satisfied with the attention and care you provided in preparing our Living Trust. From beginning to end, you listened and executed exactly what we wanted to be included in the document in plain and understandable format unlike our previous Trust. We are confident that other folks who come to you for your services will find your professionalism gratifying as we did. Salamat (thank you!). – Rudy M., North Las VegasSearchRequest A Contact      Name   First Last   Last Email *   Phone    Message *  Captcha    Estate PlanningEstate Planning OverviewWillsRevocable TrustFinancial Power of AttorneyHealth Care Directive and Medical Power of AttorneyTable of AssetsAsset ProtectionAsset Protection OverviewNevada Asset Protection TrustSPA Trust or Special Power of Appointment TrustIrrevocable Life Insurance Trust AttorneyFamily Limited Partnerships and Asset Protection LLCsIrrevocable TrustGrantor-Retained Annuity TrustCharitable Remainder TrustBusiness PlanningBusiness Planning OverviewSole ProprietorshipPartnershipLimited Liability Company (LLC)CorporationBuy-Sell AgreementRecent Posts Transferring Title of a Vehicle Without Probate How to File a Nevada Homestead Declaration How to Transfer Title of a Vehicle into the Beneficiary’s Name After Probate Renewing your Nevada LLC Renewing Your Wyoming LLCContact DetailsContact me for a free consultation  7371 Prairie Falcon Rd #120 Las Vegas, NV 89128 Phone: (702) 382-8202 Email: michael@mrc-law.comPopular PagesLas Vegas Estate Planning – Blended Families3 Estate Planning Items You Need NowWhat Type of Challenges do Couples without Children Face with Estate Planning?Trust Basics 101: What is a Sweetheart Trust?Becoming an Organ DonorLocation Map

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Cahill, Michael R carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Cahill, Michael R



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Cahill, Michael R



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
