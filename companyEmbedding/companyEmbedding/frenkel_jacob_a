                           This volume, presenting some of the finest research on exchange rates and international macroeconomics, contains papers and
                              critical commentary by thirty-two leading economists. Taken together, these papers provide sound evidence about the effects
                              of real and monetary factors on exchange rates and extend the analyses of exchange rates and international macroeconomics
                              by outlining the kinds of behavior and institutional arrangements that can be incorporated into such analyses. Both empirical
                              and theoretical research are represented, and the contributors analyze such issues as the performance of

                           This book collects together the basic documents of an approach to the theory and policy of the balance of payments developed
                              in the 1970s. The approach marked a return to the historical traditions of international monetary theory after some thirty
                              years of departure from them - a departure occasioned by the international collapse of the 1930s, the Keynesian Revolution
                              and a long period of war and post-war reconstruction in which the international monetary system was fragmented by exchange
                              controls, currency inconvertibility and controls over international trade and capital movements

                           This volume brings together nine papers from a conference on international macroeconomics sponsored by the NBER in 1985. International
                              economists as well as graduate students in the fields of global monetary economics, finance, and macroeconomics will find
                              this an outstanding contribution to current research. It includes two commentaries for each paper, written by experts in the
                              field, and Frenkel's detailed introduction, which serves as a reader's guide to the arguments made, the models employed, and

                           The studies deal with the determination of foreign exchange rates and the characteristics of the foreign exchange market.
                              They extend frontiers in theory and test the implications against current and past data. Analysis is made of flexible exchange
                              rates through a new approach the authors have developed, called the "asset-market approach." In a fresh departure from the
                              bulk of economic literature, theory is combined with practical application in a clear, concise way that will be understood
                              by readers with a basic understanding of economics. The first three chapters of the book present the doctrinal history leading
                              to today's view of exchange rate deterioration, outline the authors' new approach, and integrate it with an anlaysis of macroeconomic
                              policies. The remaining eight chapters examine in detail (theoretically and empirically) the various building blocks presented
                              in the initial chapters

                              During his distinguished career at the IMF, Jacques J. Polak served as both Director of Research and, subsequently as a member
                                 of the IMF Executive Board. His distinct contribution to the discipline of international financial policy is highlighted in
                                 this book edited by Jacob A. Frenkel and Morris Goldstein. The papers included were prepared for a conference, cosponsored
                                 by the Netherlands Bank and the IMF, held in Polak's honor in Washington, D.C., in January 1991

                              These two volumes present analytical work done in the Fund on the international monetary system over the 1987-91 period. Most
                                 of the articles were written by Fund staff, but the book also contains a number of countributions by academic consultants
                                 to the Fund. The aim is to provide not a comprehensive collection of work done in the Fund (the list would be too long for
                                 that), but rather to bring together a set of papers that conveys the flavor of those live issues about the system that commanded
                                 close attention in the research program. Consistent with this orientation, the book is divided into the following four sections:
                                 international economic policy coordination; European monetary and exchange rate issues (the EMS, EMU, and German unification);
                                 exchange rate determination, alternative exchange arrangements, and reform of the system; and foreign exchange markets, exchange

                              This paper highlights key macroeconomic issues related to VAT harmonization. A model is developed which emphasizes the effects
                                 of changes in the profile of various taxes on international behavior. Dynamic simulations reveal that the macroeconomic and
                                 welfare implications of VAT harmonization, including conflicts of interest, depend critically on the tax system and the degree
                                 of subsitution governing temporal and intertemporal allocations. We also demonstrate that the effects of revenue-neutral tax
                                 conversions between income and consumption tax systems undertaken by a single country depend critically on international differences
                                 in behavior

                              This paper highlights the significance of open-economy considerations in the analysis of tax reforms. It focuses on domestic
                                 and international consequences of revenue-neutral conversion between income and value-added tax systems. The principal result
                                 is that the direction of changes in key macroeconomic variables consequent on such tax conversions depends critically on the
                                 durrent account position. For example, a conversion from an income to a value-added tax system lowers the world interest rate
                                 if the country adopting the reform runs a surplus in the current account of its balance of payments, and vice versa

                              This paper deals with the early stages of transformation of centrally planned economies (CPEs) into market economies during
                                 which expectations play a key role. It focuses on the transitional phase during which the economy is not any more a CPE but
                                 has not yet become a market economy. During this phase the economy is referred to as a "previously centrally-planned economy"
                                 (PCPE). A simple model is developed to analyze the consequences of expected price liberalization. The CPEs undergoing transformation
                                 lack depth and breadth of financial markets. The analysis illustrates the benefits from an early development of such markets.
                                 It demonstrates the benefits from an early development of such markets. It demonstrates the cost of a fine-tuning strategy
                                 and the benefits from a quick implementation of price reform. The paper also examines means to reduce "liquidity overhang,"
                                 and shows that they involve taxation of one form or another. The consequences of privatization are analyzed and the benefits
                                 from an early development of an effective tax system highlighted

Biography[edit]
Frenkel earned a B.A. in economics and political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago. He earned his Ph.D. in 1970 with thesis titled Money, Wealth and the Balance of Payments in a Model of Accumulation.
Banking and financial career[edit]
Frenkel is currently the Chairman of JPMorgan Chase International, which executes the international strategy of the American financial services firm.[1] He also serves as Chairman and CEO of the Group of Thirty (G-30), which is a private, nonprofit, consultative group on international economic and monetary affairs.
Frenkel served from 2004 to 2009 as Vice Chairman of American International Group (AIG) and from 2000 to 2004 as Chairman of Merrill Lynch International, as well as Chairman of Merrill Lynch’s Sovereign Advisory and Global Financial Institutions Groups. Between 1991 and 2000 he served two terms as the Governor of the Bank of Israel. He is credited with reducing inflation in Israel and achieving price stability, liberalizing Israel’s financial markets, removing foreign exchange controls, and integrating the Israeli economy into the global financial system. During 1995–1996, Frenkel served as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Inter-American Development Bank and, during 1999–2000, as Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Between 1987 and 1991, he was the Economic Counselor and Director of Research at the International Monetary Fund, and between 1973 and 1987 he was on the faculty of the University of Chicago where he held the position of the David Rockefeller Professor of International Economics and served as Editor of the Journal of Political Economy.
He is a fellow of the Econometric Society, a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the Board of Directors of the National Bureau of Economic Research, a former member of the International Advisory Board of the Council on Foreign Relations, a member of the Trilateral Commission, a member of the board of the Council for the United States and Italy, a member of the Investment Advisory Council of the Prime Minister of Turkey, and a member of the International Advisory Council of the China Development Bank. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics.
In June 2013 he was nominated to be the Governor of the Bank of Israel for a second time.[2] In July 2013, following official inquiries into an event that took place in Hong Kong Airport in November 2006, he withdrew his nomination. Frankel denied any wrongdoing but authorities in Hong Kong stated that he had been arrested at the airport for suspected theft of a suit bag from a duty-free shop.[3]Frenkel did not disclose the incident to the Committee on Senior Appointments, which vetted his nomination for a new governor of the Bank of Israel.[4]
Frenkel serves on the Leadership Council for Concordia, a nonpartisan, nonprofit based in New York City focused on promoting effective public-private collaboration to create a more prosperous and sustainable future.
Awards and recognition[edit]
Frenkel won the 2002 Israel Prize in Economics. He received the Tel-Aviv University Hugo Ramniceanu Prize for Economics, the Czech Karel Englis Prize in Economics, the “Order de Mayo al Merito” (in the rank of Gran Cruz) decoration from the Government of Argentina and the “Order of Merit” (in the rank of Cavaliere di Gran Croce) decoration from the Republic of Italy. He is also a recipient of several Honorary Doctoral degrees and other decorations and awards, including the “1993 Economic Policy Award” by “Emerging Markets” and the “1997 Central Banker of the Year Award” by “Euromoney”.

                           The studies deal with the determination of foreign exchange rates and the characteristics of the foreign exchange market.
                              They extend frontiers in theory and test the implications against current and past data. Analysis is made of flexible exchange
                              rates through a new approach the authors have developed, called the "asset-market approach." In a fresh departure from the
                              bulk of economic literature, theory is combined with practical application in a clear, concise way that will be understood
                              by readers with a basic understanding of economics. The first three chapters of the book present the doctrinal history leading
                              to today's view of exchange rate deterioration, outline the authors' new approach, and integrate it with an anlaysis of macroeconomic
                              policies. The remaining eight chapters examine in detail (theoretically and empirically) the various building blocks presented

                              These two volumes present analytical work done in the Fund on the international monetary system over the 1987-91 period. Most
                                 of the articles were written by Fund staff, but the book also contains a number of countributions by academic consultants
                                 to the Fund. The aim is to provide not a comprehensive collection of work done in the Fund (the list would be too long for
                                 that), but rather to bring together a set of papers that conveys the flavor of those live issues about the system that commanded
                                 close attention in the research program. Consistent with this orientation, the book is divided into the following four sections:
                                 international economic policy coordination; European monetary and exchange rate issues (the EMS, EMU, and German unification);
                                 exchange rate determination, alternative exchange arrangements, and reform of the system; and foreign exchange markets, exchange

                              This paper highlights key macroeconomic issues related to VAT harmonization. A model is developed which emphasizes the effects
                                 of changes in the profile of various taxes on international behavior. Dynamic simulations reveal that the macroeconomic and
                                 welfare implications of VAT harmonization, including conflicts of interest, depend critically on the tax system and the degree
                                 of subsitution governing temporal and intertemporal allocations. We also demonstrate that the effects of revenue-neutral tax
                                 conversions between income and consumption tax systems undertaken by a single country depend critically on international differences

                              This paper highlights the significance of open-economy considerations in the analysis of tax reforms. It focuses on domestic
                                 and international consequences of revenue-neutral conversion between income and value-added tax systems. The principal result
                                 is that the direction of changes in key macroeconomic variables consequent on such tax conversions depends critically on the
                                 durrent account position. For example, a conversion from an income to a value-added tax system lowers the world interest rate
                                 if the country adopting the reform runs a surplus in the current account of its balance of payments, and vice versa

                              This paper deals with the early stages of transformation of centrally planned economies (CPEs) into market economies during
                                 which expectations play a key role. It focuses on the transitional phase during which the economy is not any more a CPE but
                                 has not yet become a market economy. During this phase the economy is referred to as a "previously centrally-planned economy"
                                 (PCPE). A simple model is developed to analyze the consequences of expected price liberalization. The CPEs undergoing transformation
                                 lack depth and breadth of financial markets. The analysis illustrates the benefits from an early development of such markets.
                                 It demonstrates the benefits from an early development of such markets. It demonstrates the cost of a fine-tuning strategy
                                 and the benefits from a quick implementation of price reform. The paper also examines means to reduce "liquidity overhang,"
                                 and shows that they involve taxation of one form or another. The consequences of privatization are analyzed and the benefits
                                 from an early development of an effective tax system highlighted

Lettris






Lettris is a curious tetris-clone game where all the bricks have the same square shape but different content. Each square carries a letter. To make squares disappear and save space for other squares you have to assemble English words (left, right, up, down) from the falling squares. 



boggle
Boggle gives you 3 minutes to find as many words (3 letters or more) as you can in a grid of 16 letters. You can also try the grid of 16 letters. Letters must be adjacent and longer words score better. See if you can get into the grid Hall of Fame !
