Peter Barton Hutt is a senior counsel in the Washington, DC law firm of Covington & Burling, specializing in Food and Drug Law.  He began his law practice with the firm in 1960 and, except for his four years in the government, has continued at the firm ever since.  From 1971 to 1975 he was Chief Counsel for the Food and Drug Administration.
Since 1994, Mr. Hutt has taught a full course on Food and Drug Law during Winter Term at Harvard Law School.

Harvard Law School held a symposium on January 17, 2013, “Celebrating Peter Barton Hutt’s 20 Years (thus far) at HLS.”  Mr. Hutt has collected all of the papers on Food and Drug Law prepared by his students in an electronic book that is available on his Harvard Law School faculty website: http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/hutt.  He taught the same course at Stanford Law School during Spring Term in 1998.  Mr. Hutt is the co-author of Food and Drug Law: Cases and Materials (Foundation Press, 1st edition 1980, 2d edition 1991, 3d edition 2007) and has published more than 175 book chapters and articles on Food and Drug Law and on health policy.  He is a member of the Editorial Advisory board of the Food and Drug Law Journal.
Mr. Hutt has represented the national trade associations for the food, prescription drug, nonprescription drug, dietary supplement, and cosmetic industries.  While at FDA he drafted the legislation that became the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, and beginning in 1962 he has participated in the drafting of most of the major legislation amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  He has testified before the House and Senate more than 100 times either as a witness or as counsel accompanying a witness.
Mr. Hutt has been a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences since it was formed in 1971.  He has served on the IOM Executive Committee and other NAS and IOM committees.  He recently served as a member of the Working Group on Innovation in Drug Development and Evaluation for President Obama's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST).  Mr. Hutt served on the Science Review Subcommittee of the FDA Science Board to review the FDA science needs in order to perform its regulatory mission, and published a major analysis that resulted in Congress doubling FDA appropriations.  He also recently served on the Panel on the Administrative Restructuring of the National Institutes of Health, and on the Working Group to Review Regulatory Activities Within the Division of AIDS of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.  He is a member of the Board of Directors of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, the California Healthcare Institute, and the Institute of Health Policy Analysis.  He is a past member of the Board of Directors of the AERAS Global TB Vaccine Foundation and the Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences (one of the Claremont Colleges).

Mr. Hutt has served on the IOM Roundtable for the Development of Drugs and Vaccines Against AIDS, the Advisory Committee to the Director of the National Institutes of Health, the NAS Committee on Research Training in the Biomedical and Behavioral Sciences, the NIH Advisory Committee to Review the Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research, the National Committee to Review Current Procedures for Approval of New Drugs for Cancer and AIDS established by the President's Cancer Panel of the National Cancer Institute at the request of President Bush, and five Office of Technology Assessment advisory panels.  He was a member of the New Foods Panel of the White House Conference on Food, Nutrition and Health and authored the panel report.  Mr. Hutt has twice been a councilor of the Society for Risk Analysis and has served as Legal Counsel to the Society as well as the American College of Toxicology.
During the 1960s, Mr. Hutt litigated pro bono cases on behalf of homeless alcoholics and drug addicts.  He argued the only alcoholism case ever heard in the United States Supreme Court, Powell v. Texas, and then drafted the legislation that created the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism and the National Institute of Drug Abuse.  Based on this work, two-thirds of the States have repealed their statutes that had made public intoxication a criminal offense.
Mr. Hutt was named by The Washingtonian magazine as one of Washington's 50 best lawyers (out of more than 40,000) and as one of Washington's 100 most influential people; by the National Law Journal as one the 40 best health care lawyers in the United States; and by Global Counsel as the best FDA regulatory specialist in Washington, DC.  Business Week referred to Mr. Hutt in June 2003 as the "unofficial dean of Washington food and drug lawyers."  In naming Mr. Hutt in September 2005 as one of the eleven best food and drug lawyers, the Legal Times also referred to him as "the dean of the food-and-drug bar."  In April 2005, he was presented the Distinguished Alumni Award by FDA.  In May 2005, he was given the Lifetime Achievement Award for research advocacy by the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  The Best Lawyers in America selected Mr. Hutt as the 2013 FDA Lawyer of the Year for Washington, DC.

SAN DIEGO, CA (Oct. 8, 2014)—Suneva Medical, Inc., a privately-held aesthetics company, today announced the appointment of Peter Barton Hutt as a member of its Board of Directors. Known in the legal community as the “dean of the food and drug bar,” Mr. Hutt has been a leading food and drug law practitioner and scholar for half a century. Mr. Hutt has specialized in food and drug law at the Washington D.C. firm of Covington and Burling since 1960, pausing only to serve as Chief Counsel of the FDA from 1971 to 1975. A prodigious writer, he is co-author of the Food and Drug Law: Cases and Materials. He has also taught Food and Drug Law at Harvard Law School since 1994.
“Peter is one of the world’s leading attorneys concerning FDA matters, and an expert in U.S. health policy. We are thrilled that he has joined Suneva Medical’s Board of Directors,” said Nicholas L. Teti, Jr., Chairman and CEO of Suneva Medical. “As a director, his regulatory perspective and knowledge of the health care industry will be invaluable as we advance Suneva Medical’s broad product pipeline.”
Mr. Hutt is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, and serves on a wide variety of academic and scientific advisory boards and on the Board of Directors of several companies. In addition, he has represented the national trade associations for the food, prescription drug, nonprescription drug, dietary supplement, and cosmetic industries.  While at the FDA he drafted the legislation that became the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, and beginning in 1962 he has participated in the drafting of most of the major legislation amending the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  He has testified before the House and Senate more than 100 times either as a witness or as counsel accompanying a witness.
Mr. Hutt received his B.A., magna cum laude, from Yale University, his LL.B. from Harvard University, and his LL.M. from New York University.
