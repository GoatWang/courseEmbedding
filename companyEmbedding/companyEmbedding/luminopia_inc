TESTIMONIALS 


         
I am always looking for creative ways to turn a party into a fiesta. The FLIC Luminaries allowed me to do just that. They are easy to set out, seem to burn forever, and are easy to pick up. The way they "glow" is just incredible!
E. Luke ~ Interior Designer




         
Good riddance to paper bag luminaries. In 2001 and 2002 our neighborhood luminary display was completely ruined by sleet and wind. After hours of preparation and lighting we were wiped out by mother nature. After using the FLIC Luminaries last year I will never use any other.
B. Frailey ~ Wichita, KS




         
Just a heads up how strong your luminaries are....I ordered some time back needing some that could stand the south Texas heat and climate....and they held up in 110 mph winds of the recent hurricane (Ike). Trees were down in the yard but not these babies.... They are great! Thanks....
S. Alexander ~ Texas




         
A friend told me about your luminaries just in time for the wedding I was planning for my daughter in Puerto Aventuras in Mexico. We arranged them on the beach and they glowed throughout our wedding. My husband said they were easy to install. He used the stakes to hold them down, and the wind shields to block the strong ocean breeze. They were absolutely beautiful. Thank you!
S. Dawson ~ Grant's Ferry, Arkansas




         
After a ladder accident my wife forbid me from hanging Christmas lights on the house. That is when I discovered flic luminaries and have been a happy customer ever since. No more climbing ladders! This coming year will be our fifth year of using them and they still look brand new! I advise everyone to give them a try, you won't be sorry.
L. Whitson ~ Oakland, California

FLIC Luminaria lantern Sets:
Perfect for all occasions - from wedding receptions to Christmas decor to being the hit at any party! You can decorate these luminary lanterns or decorate around them or use them on their own for simple elegance.
Timeless Shape & Style - looks like a contemporary version of the old-fashioned paper sack but without all the problems. No folding required - saves time, hassle and frustration.
Beautiful Warm Glow - FLIC Luminaries radiate a warm glow with both the long burning candles and the electric bulbs. This glow enhances all your events and turns them into very special occasions.
Waterproof, Durable, and Reusable - FLIC Luminaries are made from a sturdy polymer with UV inhibitors that is resistant to weather and the elements. Our Luminaries are tough enough to stand on and can be used season after season, year after year. We lead the industry with a Limited 5-Year Warranty.
Effortless Installation - easy to install and store. Use sand, gravel, or water for weighting or our special stakes which let you use the FLIC Luminaries on uneven surfaces and slopes. No other luminary has the versatility of FLIC Luminaries. They even nest together for efficient and easy storage.
 FLIC Luminarias - the weatherproof and reusable solution for your holiday and event lighting needs.
SIZE & LENGTH: Each luminary lantern is 9-inches tall, 6-inches wide and 4-inches deep. For customers buying lights strings; they are 36-feet long, 12 sockets with 3-feet between each socket. One light string per set of 12 luminaries and can be strung end-to-end for up to 4 sets per string circuit.
SHIPPING FEES: Free Shipping on orders over $30!
LIGHT SOURCE OPTIONS:
1. No Light Source - Our luminarias are designed for general use.  If you have your own tealights, candles or C7 light strings, you can use them with our luminaries.  If using candles, we advise some kind of candle holder and always monitor while in use.
2. Candles & Holders - Our first, and most-traditional source of lighting. 12 candles and 12 holders come with each set of 12 luminaries. PROS: Nice flickering candle light. No electric cords involved. Candles last approximately 8 hours. CONS: Risk of fire and requires constant attention when in use.  Requires cleaning of holders on a regular basis.
3. Citronella Candles & Holders - A popular selection for summer when used near people. 12 citronella candles and 12 holders come with each set of 12 luminaries.  PROS: Citronella scent helps repel mosquitos and insects. Nice flickering candle light. No electric cords involved. Candles last approximately 12 hours. CONS: Risk of fire and requires constant attention when in use. Citronella scent is not popular with all people. Requires cleaning of holders on a regular basis.
4. Electric Light Strings - Our most-popular light source. Available in green or white color.  12-socket light strings with 36-inches between sockets, 36-feet in total length. Comes with 13 standard clear C7 bulbs (one extra bulb!).  PROS: Our brightest option. Convenient on/off at one location. Versatile bulb possibilities. CONS: electric cord between luminaries. Requires 110-volt outlet nearby.
5. LED Tea Lights - Our second most-popular light source. 12 individual tea lights to match set of 12 luminaries. PROS: Nice flickering warm white light mimics candles. No fire hazard. No electric cords involved. Batteries last approximately 50 hours. CONS: Less brightness than electric light strings. On/off must occur at each tealight. We do offer other colors of tealights. If you would like to match your luminaries with another tea light besides warm white, select "No Light Source" and after adding your luminaries into your shopping cart, head over to our "Lighting Accessories" product section to find the tea light color you desire.  Our default tea light color above is the closest match to the luminary color above.
*NEW!  LED Tea Lights with Timer!  No more having to turn your tea lights on an off every evening!  Simply turn them on once (at the time you want them to come on every evening) and they will stay on for 5 hours and then will automatically shut off for 19 hours.  It will continue this same timing sequence every following evening.  All you have to do is turn them on once!
LUMINARY STAKES OPTION:
1. With Luminary Stakes - If you intend to use our luminaries outside, it is advised that you consider a method to secure the luminaries to the surface you will place them on.  High winds or unlevel surfaces are common situations that will disturb your careful luminary setup.  There are 2 easy solutions for securing your luminaries.  The easiest method, if you have a penetrable surface, is to also select our luminary stakes that are matched specifically to your luminaries.  The other option involves weighing down your luminaries with sand or small pebble stones in the base. 
2. No Luminary Stakes - If you plan to use sand or small pebble stones to secure your luminaries no luminary stakes are necessary.
Buy our luminaries and feel confident you are buying the best luminary lantern offered for decorative lighting!

A winner!
This was my first Christmas with flic luminaries and I have to say it was very positive.  This is the third different luminary company I have tried and I wish I had bought these first because they are by far the best!  Definitely not the cheapest luminary, but these will last me the rest of my life, so it is far worth the money.

Extremely Fun For Kid's Party!
Bought these luminaries and also the color changing LED tea lights in the lighting accessory section. They ended up being everything I could imagine and more. I used luminaries for birthday decor for our child's 4th birthday and the kids loved them! I think the parents loved them just as much! These luminary sets and lights are well made so we can use them for years. I'm just not sure if we can wait a whole year before using them again. We let our child keep one luminary in his room with a color changing LED light. That was 2 weeks ago and it is still a big hit! I highly recommend these!

Buying once again.
I used to own these at my old house but lost them in my divorce!  Glad these guys are still around.  You only have to buy these luminarias once because they last forever.... unless you get a divorce!

June wedding lights
Just had our wedding last weekend! We bought these for our wedding reception lighting.  Ran them on the perimeter.  They really added ambiance and class.  Received many compliments.  Very thankful for all the great customer service at this site helping us zone in on what we really needed.  Ask them about anything and I'm sure they will help you out.  I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for wedding lighting.

Perfect white wedding luminaries!
We used these white luminaries at our wedding reception and they were perfect!  Buy these when they are on sale (like I did) for a real bargain. These are plastic luminaries built very well and look expensive.  Definitely the formal choice over flimsy paper luminaries.  Cheap luminaries made from paper look just that, cheap.  The last kind of impression you want at a wedding reception!  I highly recommend these luminaries to everyone.  We received so many compliments at our reception party!

Solid Choice
I've owned these luminaries for a long time.  They are very solid and can stay outside for long periods in use.  A little soap and water and they are cleaned up and look just like new!  I've returned to this company to buy more and we will extend the beauty to our back deck for year-round decorative lighting.

I love these luminaries!
I recently purchased these white luminaries and have set them up outside.  They look great and they are made well and should last for years!  Great job, FLIC!  I'll be back to buy more luminaries soon!

*NEW!  LED Tea Lights with Timer!  No more having to turn your tea lights on an off every evening!  Simply turn them on once (at the time you want them to come on every evening) and they will stay on for 5 hours and then will automatically shut off for 19 hours.  It will continue this same timing sequence every following evening.  All you have to do is turn them on once!
LUMINARY STAKES OPTION:
1. With Luminary Stakes - If you intend to use our luminaries outside, it is advised that you consider a method to secure the luminaries to the surface you will place them on.  High winds or unlevel surfaces are common situations that will disturb your careful luminary setup.  There are 2 easy solutions for securing your luminaries.  The easiest method, if you have a penetrable surface, is to also select our luminary stakes that are matched specifically to your luminaries.  The other option involves weighing down your luminaries with sand or small pebble stones in the base. 
2. No Luminary Stakes - If you plan to use sand or small pebble stones to secure your luminaries no luminary stakes are necessary.
Buy our luminaries and feel confident you are buying the best luminary lantern offered for decorative lighting!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
