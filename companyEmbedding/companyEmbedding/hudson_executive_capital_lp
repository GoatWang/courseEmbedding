Investment Strategy
We apply a “private equity approach” to investing in public markets, pursuing similar operational and strategic actions sought by private equity investors; however, by staying in the public small/mid-cap market and affecting collaborative change without taking majority stakes, we can avoid control premiums, illiquidity, and overcrowded names, limiting potential overlap with other hedge funds.
The investment team performs deep research to identify fundamentally undervalued companies, focusing on those where actionable operational improvements and strategic transactions can enhance shareholder value. The Firm’s investment universe includes 2,500+ U.S. public companies with market values between $500 million and $15 billion, focused on our Founder’s and CEO investors’ expertise across sectors, including: Consumer/Retail, Financials, Healthcare, Industrials, Real Estate, and Technology/Media/Telecom.

Hudson Executive Capital is an investment firm that seeks to identify value-oriented opportunities in the small/mid-cap U.S. public markets to actively engage with management, boards and shareholders of portfolio companies. The Firm operates through Constructive Engagement, collaboratively driving change through operational improvements and strategic transactions to generate alpha for our investors. Douglas Braunstein, Founder and Managing Partner, has 30+ years of transactional experience and leads a seasoned team of investment professionals to identify actionable opportunities and work directly with portfolio companies to catalyze value and drive returns. In what we believe to be a unique structure, a group of 35+ current and former public company CEO investors in the Fund may assist the investment team (subject to conflicts and compliance rules) through all stages of the process, from identifying investment opportunities through implementation of our operational and strategic agenda with portfolio companies.
Through a new model of activist investing, the Firm’s dedication towards a collaborative approach is aligned with the public company environment, taking advantage of changes in U.S. corporate governance and an increasingly active institutional investor base. The Firm seeks to preserve and drive shareholder value in a cooperative manner, formally forgoing the right to conduct hostile proxy fights and public media tactics.

Activist Fund Hudson Executive Capital is About To Make Another Investment









Armie Margaret Lee




Jun 6, 2016 2:43 PM EDT













 












































































 Since its founding last year, activist investor Hudson Executive Capital LP has received 16 inbound opportunities from publicly traded companies  seeking its investment, according to James C. Woolery, Hudson Executive's co-founder and managing partner, during the  The Deal's Corporate Governance 2016 conference on Monday.   Of the 16, Hudson Executive has invested in one and is about to invest in another, said Woolery. He did not name the companies.   Those companies are separate from Hudson Executive's investments that have been previously disclosed, including CIT Group ( CIT) , Comerica  ( CMA) and WhiteWave Foods ( WWAV) .   WhiteWave is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio. Want to be alerted before CLearn more now.ramer buys or sells WWAV? Learn more now.   New York-based Hudson Executive was formed last year by Wall Street veterans Woolery and Douglas Braunstein. They have  assembled a stable of current and former CEOs, together with a senior adviser for governance and regulatory matters, to serve on the firm's advisory board.   Woolery, whose firm does not engage in proxy battles, told conference attendees at the JW Marriott Essex House in New York City on Monday that we're moving to a post-proxy fight world.   While there will still be proxy fights brought about by other activist firms, Woolery thinks that shareholders "have a lot of soft power away from proxy fights. They're going to exercise it in an increasingly active way."   That's the world we're heading toward, he said, adding that we're in the early innings of that.   Woolery was on a panel called "How the Engagement between Traditional Long-Only Funds, Activist Investors, Companies and Shareholders is Changing," that included Steven R. Walker, general counsel and managing director, board advisory services at National Association of Corporate Directors; Zach Oleksiuk, head of Americas corporate governance and responsible investment at BlackRock ( BLK) ; Clifton S. Robbins, CEO at of Blue Harbour Group; and Anne Sheehan, director of corporate governance at the California State Teachers' Retirement System. The panel was moderated by The Deal's senior editor of financial regulation, Ronald Orol.   Hudson Executive and Blue Harbour are among the firms that engage in what Orol describes as collaborative, constructivist-type activism, in which there are no threats of proxy contests.   Among Blue Harbour's investment criteria, said Robbins, is that "we have to want to back the management team." Robbins started Greenwich, Conn.-based Blue Harbour in 2004 after working at private equity firms such as General Atlantic Partners and KKR ( KKR) .    Both CalSTRS' Sheehan and BlackRock's Oleksiuk said they support activists that employ a variety of approaches.   "Any activist will tell you it's not their preferred approach," Sheehan said, referring to proxy battles.
