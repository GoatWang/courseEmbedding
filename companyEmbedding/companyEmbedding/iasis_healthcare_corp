Overview

Physicians
Physicians are the foundation of IASIS Healthcare and the critical link connecting our unique brand of healthcare to our hospitals, employees, patients and the communities we call home.
When genuine, mutually respectful relationships are built and sustained, the results are:

The highest standards of patient care
Unparalleled services, equipment and facilities
Employees who believe their jobs really do make a difference
An environment where the growth and development of your practice is assured
Strong, financially sound hospitals to ensure that the healthcare needs of the community are met


We have embraced numerous types of partnerships with our physicians. While the majority of IASIS physicians have a traditional relationship with our hospitals, we also affiliate with physicians and physician extenders through employment arrangements. IASIS works with its employed physicians and extenders to identify ways to improve their overall practice operations and support them with financing and human capital. For all of its affiliated physicians, IASIS works to link them to independent practice associations, physician hospital organizations, provider service organizations and other provider sponsored healthcare delivery networks. IASIS also has established several joint ventures that include hundreds of physician owners.
MD Portal
We strive to give physicians the tolls and information they need to provide excellent care to their patients. Through MD Portal, physicians can gain secure access to the most up-to-date information about their own patients, including radiology and lab results, 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
Visit the MD Portal
I-CARE
I-CARE is a centralized support system for clinical research and continuing education activities within the IASIS Healthcare system. We provide all the tools investigators, coordinators, and sponsors need for their clinical trials in one easy-to-use location. We provide CMEs for live events and enduring material.
Visit I-CARE
Marketing
At IASIS Healthcare, we realize that one of the keys to building a successful practice is effective, strategic marketing to the consumer. Physicians who join IASIS will have the benefit of a full complement of best practices in marketing, communications and community outreach to get their practice off to a great start.
Leadership Opportunities
To ensure that physicians across the country are actively heard and represented in our organization, IASIS offers many leadership opportunities for physicians:

At the community level as members of the local hospital boards of trustees and medical executive committees
At the national level as members of IASIS’ Physician Advisory Council, which includes physicians from every hospital

Resident Web Access
Resident Web Access offers tenants of IASIS healthcare’s medical office buildings the convenience of being able to view open charges, to see transaction history, and to make lease payments online

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the 13,350,000
shares of common stock that we are offering will be approximately $185 million,
after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses, or
approximately $213 million if the underwriters' over-allotment options are
exercised in full. We will use the net proceeds from this offering to repay a
portion of our outstanding indebtedness and possibly to fund purchases of two
hospital facilities we currently operate under a lease. Unless otherwise
indicated, all information in this prospectus assumes that we will use all of
the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under our
bank credit facility.
 
     Our bank credit facility consists of a revolving credit facility and
tranche A and tranche B term loans. We may reborrow any amounts repaid under the
revolving credit facility for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. Amounts repaid under the term loans may not be reborrowed. Under the
terms of our bank credit facility, the tranche A and B term loans must be repaid
on a pro rata basis based upon the outstanding principal amount of each loan.
Additionally, we will have to pay a 1% prepayment premium on the prepaid
principal amount of the tranche B loan. Our revolving credit facility and
tranche A term loan bear interest at either the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of
New York's alternate base rate, plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 2.50%, or
its reserve-adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 3.50%,
both depending on our leverage ratio. The revolving credit facility terminates
and the tranche A term loan matures on September 30, 2004. The tranche B term
loan bears interest at the alternate base rate, plus 3.25%, or the
reserve-adjusted Eurodollar rate, plus 4.25%. The tranche B loan matures on
September 30, 2006. The weighted average interest rate on our bank credit
facility was approximately 11.1% at December 31, 2000.
 
     We have $230.0 million in 13% senior subordinated notes due October 15,
2009. We have the option, subject to the consent of our senior lenders, to use a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to redeem up to 35% of the notes
at a redemption price of 113% of the principal amount of the notes, plus accrued
unpaid interest to the redemption date.
 
     We are currently negotiating to acquire two hospital facilities that we
currently operate under a lease agreement for approximately $55 million. Annual
rent payments for these hospitals are currently approximately $7.7 million. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to reach an agreement to purchase these
facilities. If we are unable to reach an agreement to purchase these facilities,
we will use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding
indebtedness. Our bank credit facility does not permit us to acquire these
facilities without the consent of our lenders.
 
     Until used to repay indebtedness or fund the purchase of these facilities,
we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade
securities.


Most of our hospitals are located in high-growth markets that are expected
to experience population growth rates through 2005 in excess of the national
average. In large part, a hospital's revenue, whether from managed care plans,
traditional health insurance payors or directly from patients, depends on the
quality and scope of physicians' practices associated with the hospital.
Physicians refer patients to hospitals
primarily on the basis of the quality and scope of services provided by the
hospital, the quality of the medical staff and employees affiliated with the
hospital, the quality and age of the hospital's facilities and equipment, and
the hospital's location. We intend to retain and recruit physicians by equipping
our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment, sponsoring training
programs to educate physicians on advanced medical procedures and enhancing
physician convenience and access. While physicians may terminate their
affiliation with a hospital operated by us at any time, our hospitals seek to
retain physicians of varied specialties on the hospitals' medical staffs and to
recruit other qualified physicians. We strive to maintain and improve the level
of care at our hospitals and to provide quality facilities, equipment, employees
and services for physicians and their patients. A number of factors affect our
competitive position, including:
     - number, quality and specialties of physicians, nurses and other
       healthcare professionals;
     - the scope, breadth and quality of services;
     - reputation;
     - managed care contracting relationships;
     - physical condition of facilities and medical equipment;
     - location;
     - availability of parking or proximity to public transportation;
     - charges for services; and
     - ability to form local hospital networks.
     We currently face competition from established, not-for-profit healthcare
corporations, investor-owned hospital corporations, large tertiary care centers
and outpatient service providers. In the future, we expect to encounter
increased competition from companies, like ours, that consolidate hospitals and
healthcare companies in specific geographic markets. Continued consolidation in
the healthcare industry will be a leading contributing factor to increased
competition in markets in which we already have a presence and in markets we may
enter in the future.
     Another factor in the competitive position of a hospital is the ability of
its management to negotiate contracts with purchasers of group healthcare
services. The importance of obtaining managed care contracts has increased in
recent years and is expected to continue to increase as private and government
payors and others turn to managed care organizations to help control rising
healthcare costs. Our markets have experienced significant managed care
penetration. The revenue and operating results of our hospitals are
significantly affected by our hospitals' ability to negotiate favorable
contracts with managed care plans. Health maintenance organizations and
preferred provider organizations use managed care contracts to direct patients
to, and manage the use of, hospital services in exchange for discounts from the
hospitals' established charges. Traditional health insurers also are interested
in containing costs through similar contracts with hospitals.
     An additional competitive factor is whether a hospital is part of a local
hospital network and the scope and quality of services offered by the network
and by competing networks. A hospital that is part of a network that offers a
broad range of services in a wide geographic area is more likely to obtain more
favorable managed care contracts than a hospital that is not. We intend to
evaluate changing circumstances in each geographic area in which we operate on
an ongoing basis and to position ourselves to compete in these managed care
markets by forming our own, or joining with others to form, local hospital
networks.


Company Description
INDUSTRY OVERVIEW

     The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration estimated that in 1999 total
annual U.S. healthcare expenditures grew by 6.0% to $1.2 trillion. It projects
that total U.S. healthcare spending will grow by 6.5% annually from 2001 through
2008. By these estimates, healthcare


 expenditures will account for approximately
$2.2 trillion, or 16.2%, of the total U.S. gross domestic product by 2008.

     Hospital services represents the largest segment of the healthcare
industry, accounting for 33% of total healthcare expenditures in 1999, or $401
billion. The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration projects the hospital
services category to grow by 5.7% per year through 2008. It expects growth in
hospital spending to continue due to the aging of the U.S. population and
consumer demand for expanded medical services. According to the American
Hospital Association, there are over 5,000 hospitals in the United States, of
which approximately 86% are owned by not-for-profit and government entities.

     The U.S. hospital industry is broadly defined to include acute care,
rehabilitation and psychiatric facilities that are either public (government
owned and operated), not-for-profit private (religious or secular), or
for-profit institutions (investor owned). These facilities offer a broad range
of healthcare services, including internal medicine, general surgery,
cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, obstetrics and gynecology, and
emergency services. In addition, hospitals also offer other ancillary services
including psychiatric, diagnostic, rehabilitation, home health and outpatient
surgery services.

  Hospital Industry Trends

     Demographic Trends.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are
approximately 35 million Americans aged 65 or older in the United States today,
who comprise approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. By the year 2030
the number of elderly persons is expected to climb to 69 million, or 20% of the
total population. Due to the increasing life expectancy of Americans, the number
of people aged 85 years and older is also expected to increase from 4.3 million
to 8.5 million by the year 2030. This increase in life expectancy will increase
demand for healthcare services and, as importantly, the demand for innovative,
more sophisticated means of delivering those services. Hospitals, as the largest
category of care in the healthcare market, will be among the main beneficiaries
of this increase in demand.

     Consolidation.  During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was
significant industry consolidation involving large, investor-owned hospital
companies seeking to achieve economies of scale. While consolidation activity in
the hospital industry is continuing, this consolidation is primarily taking
place through mergers and acquisitions involving not-for-profit hospital
systems. Reasons for this activity include:

     - limited access to capital;

     - financial performance issues, including challenges associated with
       changes in reimbursement;

     - the desire to enhance the local availability of healthcare in the
       community;

     - the need and ability to recruit primary care physicians and specialists;
       and

     - the need to achieve general economies of scale and to gain access to
       standardized and centralized functions, including favorable supply
       agreements.

     Shifting Utilization Trends.  Over the past decade, many procedures that
had previously required hospital visits with overnight stays have been performed
on an outpatient basis. This shift has been driven by cost containment efforts
led by private and government payors. The focus on cost containment has
coincided with advancements in medical technology that have allowed patients to
be treated with less invasive procedures that do not require overnight stays.
According to the American Hospital Association, the number of surgeries
performed on an inpatient basis declined from 1994 to 1998 at an average annual
rate of 0.3%, from 9.8 million in 1994 to 9.7 million in 1998. During the same
period, the number of outpatient surgeries increased at an average annual rate
of 4.3%, from 13.2 million in 1994 to 15.6 million


in 1998. The mix of inpatient as compared to outpatient surgeries shifted from a
ratio of 42.8% inpatient to 57.2% outpatient in 1994 to a ratio of 38.4%
inpatient to 61.6% outpatient in 1998.

     These trends have led to a reduction in the average length of stay and, as
a result, inpatient utilization rates. According to the American Hospital
Association, the average length of stay in hospitals has declined from 6.7 days
in 1994 to 6.0 days in 1998.

COMPANY OVERVIEW

     We are a leading owner and operator of acute care hospitals that develops
and operates networks of medium-sized hospitals in high-growth urban and
suburban markets. We operate our hospitals with a strong community focus by
offering and developing healthcare services to meet the needs of the markets we
serve, promoting strong relationships with physicians, working with local
managed care plans and recruiting experienced local management. As of December
31, 2000, we owned or leased 15 hospitals with a total of 2,194 operating beds.
Our hospitals are currently located in four regions:

     - Salt Lake City, Utah;

     - Phoenix, Arizona;

     - Tampa-St. Petersburg, Florida; and

     - three cities in the State of Texas, including San Antonio.

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, approximately 90% of our net
revenue was derived from markets within our regions that are growing at rates
above the national average. Additionally, our net revenue from hospital
operations is well balanced across these regions, with each region contributing
between 20% and 25% of our total net revenue. We also operate five ambulatory
surgery centers and a Medicaid managed health plan called Health Choice that
serves over 42,000 members in Arizona. For the twelve months ended December 31,
2000, we had total net revenue of $848.3 million and EBITDA of $124.1 million,
both excluding start-up results at one of our hospitals.

     IASIS was formed in October 1999 through a series of transactions that were
arranged by Joseph Littlejohn & Levy, Inc. and members of our management team.
Joseph Littlejohn & Levy is the private equity firm that controls JLL
Healthcare, LLC, our largest stockholder. As part of a recapitalization
transaction, we acquired a controlling interest in a subsidiary of Paracelsus
that owned five hospitals and other related assets. Following this transaction,
we also acquired ten hospitals and other related assets from Tenet.

     Since October 1999, we have put in place an experienced senior management
team under whose leadership we have:

     - developed strategic plans for each of our markets and facilities;

     - recruited additional physicians to our hospitals;

     - expanded and improved our facilities and services;

     - installed standardized clinical and financial information systems in 11
       of our 15 hospitals;

     - strengthened our local management teams; and

     - initiated company-wide compliance and quality assurance programs.

As a result of these initiatives, during the twelve months ended December 31,
2000, we achieved net revenue growth of 8.5% and an increase in patient
admissions of 8.6% compared to the pro forma twelve months ended December 31,
1999, both excluding start-up results at Rocky Mountain Medical Center.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

     Our objective is to provide high quality, cost-effective healthcare
services in the communities we serve. The key elements of our business strategy
are:

     - INCREASE OUR MARKET SHARE IN HIGH-GROWTH MARKETS.  Most of our hospitals
       are located in high-growth markets that are expected to experience
       population growth rates through 2005 in excess of


       the national average. We intend to increase our market share in our
       existing markets through organic growth and selective acquisitions.

     - RECRUIT AND RETAIN QUALITY PHYSICIANS.  We intend to continue to recruit
       and retain quality physicians for our medical staffs and maintain their
       loyalty to our facilities by:

        - equipping our hospitals with technologically advanced equipment;

        - sponsoring training programs to educate physicians on advanced medical
          procedures;

        - providing physicians with remote access to clinical information
          through our new information systems; and

        - enhancing physician convenience and access.

       We also use our existing physician relationships to recruit new primary
       care physicians and specialists. In addition, we are establishing local
       physician advisory committees to work closely with our local management
       teams and to advise us on facility- and market-specific needs and
       strategies.

     - INCREASE REVENUE BY EXPANDING OUR SERVICES.  We analyze demographic and
       patient data and consult with key physicians and payors to identify and
       prioritize the healthcare needs of the communities we serve. In fiscal
       2001, we intend to allocate approximately 80% of our capital expenditure
       budget to expand services and purchase new equipment. Examples include:

        - expanding emergency room and surgical capacity;

        - upgrading and expanding specialty services, including cardiology,
          orthopedics and obstetrics;

        - updating our technology in imaging, diagnostic and other medical
          equipment; and

        - enhancing the convenience and quality of our outpatient services.

     - PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES.  We believe the high quality of our
       services differentiates our hospitals within their markets and provides
       us with a competitive advantage. Between January 1, 1999 and February 1,
       2001, six of our hospitals were surveyed by the Joint Commission on
       Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations and the average of our scores,
       some of which are preliminary, is 94. Additionally, in 2000, two of our
       hospitals were recognized by the HCIA-Sachs Institute as being among the
       "Top 100 Hospitals in America" for demonstrating superior clinical,
       operational and financial performance.

     - FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE.  Our management team has extensive
       multi-facility operating experience and focuses on operational excellence
       at our facilities. We believe we can improve our operations and
       profitability by:

        - implementing case and resource management with a focus on efficient
          staffing and supply utilization;

        - capitalizing on purchasing efficiencies and reducing operating costs
          through our relationship with Broadlane, a national group purchasing
          organization;

        - completing the installation of standardized information systems at
          each of our facilities to provide us with more accurate, timely and
          cost-effective clinical and financial information; and

        - improving our billing and collection processes to increase cash flow
          and reduce bad debt expenses.

     - CONTINUE TO DEVELOP FAVORABLE MANAGED CARE RELATIONSHIPS.  We plan to
       increase patient volume at our facilities and improve our profitability
       by negotiating more favorable terms with managed care plans and, where
       desirable, entering into contracts with additional managed care plans. We
       believe that we will be able to negotiate more favorable terms by
       marketing facility-specific strengths that demonstrate:

          - the quality and breadth of our services;

          - the expertise of our physicians; and

          - convenient patient access.


      We also organize our hospitals as networks to strengthen our market
      presence and more effectively deliver healthcare services, both of which
      increase our attractiveness to managed care plans.

     - CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN LOCAL MANAGEMENT TEAMS.  We recruit experienced
       senior managers to give our hospitals their own dedicated management
       teams. Since October 1999, we have hired new executive managers at 10 of
       our 15 hospitals. We believe a strong local management team at each
       facility, including a chief executive officer, chief financial officer
       and chief nursing officer, enhances physician and community relations. We
       have developed a performance-based compensation program based upon the
       achievement of qualitative and quantitative goals set forth in an
       operating plan for each facility.

     - SELECTIVELY PURSUE ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES.  We intend to
       selectively pursue hospital acquisitions in existing and new markets
       where we believe we can improve the financial and operational performance
       of the acquired hospital and enhance our regional presence. We intend to
       target hospitals with 100 to 400 beds. We will focus our new market
       development efforts in high-growth urban and suburban regions with stable
       or improving managed care environments. In addition, we will continue to
       identify opportunities to expand our presence through strategic alliances
       with other healthcare providers.

Company Background[edit]
Founded in 1998, IASIS Healthcare is an owner and operator of community-focused hospitals in high-growth markets. IASIS Healthcare began principal operations in October 1999, in transactions arranged by the management team and Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. In 2004, Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm managing over $13 billion in assets, led a group of investors to acquire IASIS. In February 2015, it filed for an initial public offering.[1]
IASIS Healthcare Foundation[edit]
The IASIS Healthcare Foundation is a charitable organization that was created in an effort to provide healthcare services, supplies and training to disadvantaged regions around the world. The Foundation’s first mission was a trip to the Serengeti Region in the east African nation of Tanzania. Since then, the foundation has provided aid to Haiti after the devastating earthquake as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Company Background[edit]
Founded in 1998, IASIS Healthcare is an owner and operator of community-focused hospitals in high-growth markets. IASIS Healthcare began principal operations in October 1999, in transactions arranged by the management team and Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. In 2004, Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm managing over $13 billion in assets, led a group of investors to acquire IASIS. In February 2015, it filed for an initial public offering.[1]
IASIS Healthcare Foundation[edit]
The IASIS Healthcare Foundation is a charitable organization that was created in an effort to provide healthcare services, supplies and training to disadvantaged regions around the world. The Foundation’s first mission was a trip to the Serengeti Region in the east African nation of Tanzania. Since then, the foundation has provided aid to Haiti after the devastating earthquake as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Company Background[edit]
Founded in 1998, IASIS Healthcare is an owner and operator of community-focused hospitals in high-growth markets. IASIS Healthcare began principal operations in October 1999, in transactions arranged by the management team and Joseph Littlejohn & Levy. In 2004, Texas Pacific Group, a private equity firm managing over $13 billion in assets, led a group of investors to acquire IASIS. In February 2015, it filed for an initial public offering.[1]
IASIS Healthcare Foundation[edit]
The IASIS Healthcare Foundation is a charitable organization that was created in an effort to provide healthcare services, supplies and training to disadvantaged regions around the world. The Foundation’s first mission was a trip to the Serengeti Region in the east African nation of Tanzania. Since then, the foundation has provided aid to Haiti after the devastating earthquake as well as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
