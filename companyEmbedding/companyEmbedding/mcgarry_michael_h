PITTSBURGH, Feb. 19, 2015 – PPG Industries (NYSE:PPG) today announced the appointment of Michael H. McGarry, currently chief operating officer, to president and chief operating officer, effective March 1. McGarry became chief operating officer in August 2014.

McGarry will continue to have executive oversight responsibility for all of PPG’s strategic business units and operating regions and for the information technology (IT), environment, health and safety (EH&S), and purchasing functions. He will remain based at PPG’s global headquarters in Pittsburgh and will continue to report to Chairman and CEO Charles E. Bunch.

“Michael’s appointment to president recognizes his continued leadership in driving PPG’s growth as the world’s largest coatings company,” Bunch said. “Michael has played a key role in important strategic actions, including PPG’s acquisition and successful integration of AkzoNobel’s North American architectural coatings business and the recently completed acquisition of Consorcio Comex. Michael’s proven ability to lead the implementation of our global business strategies will continue to be important in delivering increased shareholder value.”

During his 34 years with PPG, McGarry has served in a variety of key business and functional leadership roles in the United States, Europe and Asia. In addition, he helped lead several strategic actions that have transformed PPG’s business portfolio, most notably the acquisition of SigmaKalon; the separation of PPG’s former commodity chemicals business; the acquisition and integration of AkzoNobel’s North American architectural coatings business; and, most recently, the acquisition of Consorcio Comex, S.A. de C.V.

McGarry joined PPG in 1981 as an engineer at the company’s Lake Charles, Louisiana, chemicals complex. He then progressed through a series of management assignments of increasing responsibility, including market development manager, silica products; operations manager, silicas, Thailand; business manager, TESLIN® sheet; and product manager in the derivatives, chlorine, liquid and dry caustic soda businesses.

He was named general manager, fine chemicals, in 2000, and vice president, chlor-alkali and derivatives, in 2004. McGarry was elected vice president, coatings, Europe, and managing director, PPG Europe, in 2006, and senior vice president, commodity chemicals, in 2008. He was named executive vice president in September 2012. In this role, his leadership responsibilities included the automotive refinish, aerospace, global architectural, and protective and marine coatings businesses, as well as the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific regions, and the EH&S and IT functions.

			Michael H. McGarry 		

B.S. ME 1980President and CEO, PPG Industries
Michael H. McGarry is president and CEO of the world’s leading coatings and paints company. Having worked for PPG Industries for more than three decades, McGarry helped transform the company into the one it is today — a global supplier of paints, coatings, optical products, specialty materials, glass and fiber. Under his leadership, PPG Industries has grown to $15 billion in sales with operations in more than 70 countries.
McGarry received his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the Cockrell School of Engineering at The University of Texas at Austin in 1980. In 2005, he completed the Harvard Business School’s Advanced Management Program, a continuing education program for senior business executives. McGarry holds a U.S. patent granted in 1996 for synthetic paper he designed for use in clean room applications.
After graduation, McGarry, who is originally from New Orleans, joined PPG Industries in 1981 and returned to Louisiana to work as an engineer at the company’s Lake Charles chemicals complex. He served in numerous sales and marketing roles before moving back into operations to build a PPG Industries plant in Thailand. Upon returning to the United States in 1991, McGarry began running the company’s commodity and specialty businesses.
In 2006, he relocated to PPG Industries’ European headquarters in Rolle, Switzerland, to serve as vice president of coatings for Europe and managing director of PPG Industries Europe. McGarry returned to the U.S. and became senior vice president of commodity chemicals in 2008, and, in 2012, he was elected executive vice president. In 2015, he was promoted to president and CEO.
McGarry is on the boards of PPG Industries and Axiall Corporation, which are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. He is also on the board of the American Coatings Association and the Allegheny Conference for Community Development. McGarry and his wife Wanda Way (B.S. Chemistry 1980) reside in Pittsburgh. The couple has two children, Matthew and Christine.
