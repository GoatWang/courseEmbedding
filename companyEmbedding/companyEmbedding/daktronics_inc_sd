Daktronics Sports Marketing (DSM) specializes in raising advertising and sponsorship revenue for colleges, universities, high schools, municipalities and teams from all sports to fund new technology in sporting venues.[29]
Notable[edit]
Daktronics has been supplying scoreboards and video displays for the Olympics for several years. However, the Olympic Games often have contracts with larger corporations, such as Swiss Timing, so the Daktronics name is not often used.
Daktronics has been an influence in NBA rule changes in the 2000s. The company manufactured the first backboard light strips to comply with buzzer beater instant replay rulings, and in 2004, developed a see-through shot clock to improve spectator visibility.[30]

In 1994, he became manager of a design group, leading the development of Daktronics' first full color LED video display product.
