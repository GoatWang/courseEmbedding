		Let’s Make Dallas Even Better

READY TO BUY: John Goff, chairman and CEO of Crescent Real Estate Holdings in Fort Worth, says the company has allocated a significant amount of capital for new projects.



The Man Behind Crescent Real Estate Holdings
Plenty of heart, and gut instincts, got real estate and financial wiz John Goff where he is today.

John Goff is a visual kind of guy. The chairman and CEO of Crescent Real Estate Holdings likes to see things—and put things—in writing. And he appreciates the “look” of things. His Fort Worth office sports a clean, tasteful design. In the conference room, panels of windows showcase the view of Sundance Square; large terraces offer an even closer look. One of the conference room walls is covered in floor-to-ceiling whiteboard. And as we begin to discuss Goff’s various operations, he jumps out of his chair, grabs a marker, and starts scribbling.
Goff, 55, draws four boxes to illustrate the different segments of his business life: Goff Capital Inc., Goff Capital Partners, Goff Family Foundation, and Crescent. 
Goff Capital Inc. handles the family money. Six investment pros—including former Goldman Sachs executive Keith Ohnmeis and Goff’s oldest son, Travis—trade interests in public securities (both debt and equity), as well as oil and gas, private equity, and real estate. 
Goff Capital Partners, launched in 1997, handles investments for institutional partners and others. It’s run by Goff and two managing partners who head offices in Denver and Stamford, Conn. The group has purchased $4 billion in real estate debt during the past two years, and it just closed on a $500 million commitment with an offshore investor. 
For both capital groups, Goff is the idea guy, focusing primarily on strategy. 
Goff Family Foundation, which Goff formed in 2007, is led by his sister, Jill Goff. It provides scholarships to students, as well as significant support to Como Elementary School on the west side of Fort Worth.
And then there’s Crescent Real Estate, the company Goff launched, built, took public, sold at the peak of the market in 2007 for $6.5 billion—and reacquired in late 2009 with Barclays Capital for much, much less.
Leading up to the deal’s closing, Goff says it was hard to believe it was going to happen. And once the ink dried, he says, “I had to pinch myself for two weeks afterward.”
Goff runs his various operations from a building on Commerce Street that sits about a block away from Crescent’s Fort Worth headquarters. In his office hangs a striking painting by Craig Hawkins that bears the quote, “It’s your heart, not the dictionary, that gives meaning to your words,” a variation of Matthew 12:34. 
Goff has plenty of heart, but it’s his gut instincts that have gotten him where he is today.
He grew up in Lake Jackson, a blue-collar town off the Texas Gulf Coast that sprung up in the mid-1940s around a new Dow Chemical plant. Goff was a “surprise,” much younger than his two older sisters and brother. (His brother, Charlie, is the retired chairman and CEO of Houston-based Destec Energy. At one point the two Goffs were both heading up NYSE-traded companies, the only time two brothers are believed to have done so.)Crescent's office portfolio includes 35 Class A buildings. Amond them are (left to right) Trammell Crow, Carter Burgess Plaza, and The Crescent. photography courtesy of Crescent Real Estate HoldingsGoff started working at the age of 12. He loved to make money—and he saved it. After earning an accounting degree at The University of Texas, he joined a CPA firm in Houston. He dove into the numbers, learning as much as he could about the financial operations of a business. Eighteen months later, he went to work for prolific Houston developer Kenneth Schnitzer. Then in 1981, the newly married Goff moved to Fort Worth, so his wife could be closer to her family. Goff had offers from a number of Dallas real estate firms, but opted to go back into public accounting and joined Peat Marwick (now KPMG). 
“Something in my gut didn’t feel right about the real estate business at the time,” he says. “Within a few years, all of those firms I had talked with were gone.”
At Peat Marwick, Goff took on advisory work, audit work, SEC work, initial pulic offerings, soaking up knowledge and experience. He also connected with Richard Rainwater, the financial genius who grew a fortune—first for the Bass family, and then for himself. 
After Rainwater left the Basses, Goff joined him. The then-32-year-old’s first assignment: take $50 million and buy companies that had been hit by the October 1987 stock market collapse. “It was frightening, but by this time I felt I could tear apart a financial statement as good as anybody,” Goff says. “I worked from the ground up, just trying to find companies that I liked that were being sold at what I felt were very cheap evaluations. It was nirvana for me.”
Quarterbacking Staubach
In the late 1980s, Rainwater and Goff were approached by Roger Staubach, who was looking to focus his growing real estate firm. At the time, The Staubach Co. was heavily invested in commercial properties. “Roger’s tenant rep business was quite small, but it was profitable,” Goff says. “We convinced him to focus exclusively on tenant rep, and we invested $1 million for a 20 percent stake in the company.”
That $1 million eventually turned into more than $70 million, through distributions and the $700 million sale to Jones Lang LaSalle in 2008.“So many times the focus is on Roger and football, but he grew an incredible business,” Goff says.
Staubach shares credit for his firm’s success with Goff. “John was very instrumental in some of the decisions we made through the years—Richard, too,” Staubach says. “John is very smart financially and has a sense for people. He helped me develop a concept to grow the company without accumulating a lot of debt.”
Serving on The Staubach Co. board, Goff saw the beginning of what would become a significant migration of companies from the coasts into North Texas. At the time, though, Dallas was the most overbuilt market in the U.S. 
“I went to Richard and told him I wanted to take everything that was on my desk and set it aside and focus on the commercial real estate business,” Goff says. “I thought it was a chance for me to start my own company. He said, ‘Great, you put up your entire net worth.’ He then came up with what he was willing to expose to it—it was significant.” (Reports had Goff investing $8 million and Rainwater backing it with $110 million.)
“There was not one real estate professional in the area who thought it was a good idea,” Goff says. “But I felt in my gut that it was the right time to do it, as long as we could buy great assets at a discount to what they were built for.”
Building a Reit
During winter months, when he’s not in Texas, Goff can often be found schussing down the slopes at Beaver Creek in Colorado. He loves to ski fast, and he’s good at it, having raced as part of a Celebrity Pro-Am program several times. When he works out, he needs to be working toward something, he says. Racing through a giant slalom course helps him do just that. 
Goff put that same drive and purpose into building Crescent. He began by lining up partners to invest in the various acquisitions. The first was Caroline Rose Hunt, who was looking to recapitalize The Crescent, a 1.3 million-square-foot luxury office complex in Uptown. After that 50-50 partnership was created, Goff put together additional buys, focusing exclusively on Class A buildings. He also took advantage of the real estate downturn to bring top leasing talent on board. 
“I’d love to say it was easy, but it was really hard,” Goff says. “It took a number of years for the assets to turn around, to fill them up and validate that we bought at the right price at the right time.”
In May 1994, Goff raised more cash by taking the company public with a $550 million IPO. It was at this point that the venture was given a name—Crescent Real Estate Equities, in honor of Goff’s first buy and favorite property. 
Thirteen years later, Crescent, which had become one of the largest real estate investment trusts in the country, was sold to Morgan Stanley for $6.5 billion. Investors who got in at the IPO were rewarded with a 15.4 percent compounded internal rate of return, including more than $3 billion in cash distributions. 
“We were at a point where I felt prices had peaked,” Goff says. “I’m not about to say that I was smart enough to see what was about to come. It was just my gut, again.”
Crescent, Round Two
Goff turned his focus to Goff Capital Partners in 2008, buying up more than $4 billion in distressed real estate debt and growing his team. But by the summer of 2009, rumors began to swirl that Morgan Stanley would be giving up Crescent to lender Barclays Capital, which had a $2 billion note coming due.  
Goff wanted back in. He tried to buy the whole thing on his own, but the parties could not come to an agreement on price. “What we were able to do was agree on a joint arrangement, so [Barclays] was able to stay in the deal and achieve upside along with me,” he says.
Barclays and Goff Capital Inc. formed Crescent Real Estate Holdings to acquire the Crescent portfolio in November 2009. At the helm again, Goff brought back five former Crescent executives—including John Zogg, managing director of leasing—and went about stabilizing and improving the assets. Along with five resorts, Crescent owns 35 Class A office buildings totaling 17.3 million square feet in Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, Las Vegas, and Denver. 
Goff scoffs at speculation that he is just repositioning the prized assets for sale. “These are not workouts; we are not interested in selling,” he says. “We are actually looking to grow the business, and have already committed a significant amount of capital to new projects.”
Goff’s gut is telling him 2011 will be a great time to buy. And he intends to listen. It hasn’t let him down yet.

        Fort Worth's Goff invests in Denver-based energy firm

Fort Worth-based businessman and investor John C. Goff has purchased 5.7 percent or 4.44 million shares of stock in Resolute Energy Corp. of Denver.The investment was disclosed in an SEC filing that listed Goff and several associated firms as making various stock purchases.
Resolute Energy is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the exploitation, development, exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties. The company’s asset base consists primarily of properties in Aneth Field located in the Paradox Basin in southeast Utah, the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeast New Mexico, and the Powder River and Big Horn Basins in Wyoming. Approximately 86 percent of its estimated net proved reserves were oil and approximately 92 percent were oil and natural gas liquids (NGL).Resolute Energy announced in early June that it received a letter dated June 1, 2015, from the New York Stock Exchange informing the company it has regained compliance with the NYSE's continued listing standards. The company was notified in February that it had fallen out of compliance with the requirement that the company’s common stock be above $1 per share over 30 consecutive trading days. Resolute Energy’s stock closed at $1.02 at close of the day on Monday.
Real estate investor Goff co-founded Crescent Real Estate Equities with Richard Rainwater in the early 1990s, eventually taking the company public. He sold the company in 2007, but then reacquired Crescent in a joint venture with Barclays Capital. Goff now serves as chairman and CEO of Crescent Real Estate Holdings. He is also founder and managing principal of Goff Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invests in real estate debt and equity. Goff’s family office, Goff Capital, invests in public equities and debt, distressed debt, oil and gas, and private equity. Goff was also a producer behind the Academy Award-nominated movie, Albert Nobbs, that starred Glenn Close.

THIS EVENT ENDED ON March 23rd, 2017





EVENT HOST


The Crescent







The Crescent® opened in 1986 to spectacular fanfare and was heralded as “a celebration of art, history and architecture,” thus beginning its reign as the iconic anchor of what is now known as Uptown Dallas. Still vibrant and successful, The Crescent recently finalized a $33 million renovation that touched every exterior edge of the mixed-used development, removing barriers and making it more pedestrian friendly to attract Uptown’s ever-growing crowds to its dining and retail outlets. http://www.thecrescent.com/

Fireside Chat & Q&A With Legends John Goff & Denny Alberts






John Goff
John C. Goff is a private investor based in Fort Worth, Texas. Mr. Goff co-founded Crescent Real Estate with Richard Rainwater in the early 90s, designing the strategy and orchestrating the acquisitions leading to its initial public offering in May 1994. Under his leadership as Vice Chairman and CEO, Crescent grew from approximately $500 million at its IPO to $6.5 billion upon its sale to Morgan Stanley in August 2007. Crescent provided its shareholders a 15.4 percent compounded annual return and more than $2.5 billion in cash dividends during its 13 years as a public company. In November 2009, Mr. Goff reacquired Crescent in a partnership with Barclays Capital, where he now serves as Chairman and CEO. Mr. Goff joined Mr. Rainwater in 1987, investing in public securities, private equity and distressed debt in a variety of industries including oil and gas, health care, and banking. This background led Mr. Goff to establish his own family office, Goff Capital, whose Fort Worth based team of professionals invest in similar strategies with a significant focus currently in the oil and gas sector. During the credit crisis of 1998, Mr. Goff founded Goff Capital Partners, a private equity firm that invested more than $4 billion in assets, real estate debt, and equity. In 2016, Goff combined the resources of Goff Capital Partners and Crescent to consolidate all future real estate investing into one entity. The combined organization closed on its first fund which provides for approximately $4 billion in acquisition capacity. Mr. Goff is a graduate of The University of Texas at Austin and is a member of the McCombs Business School Hall of Fame. He was named EY Entrepreneur of the Year for the Southwest Region in real estate and construction, was inducted to the North Texas Commercial Association of Realtors and Real Estate Professionals Hall of Fame. Much of Mr. Goff’s charitable efforts are directed through The Goff Family Foundation which focuses on education through scholarship programs and creative solutions for specific schools in need. Most notably, the foundation founded B Sharp Youth Music, a non-traditional, after- school, music education program and Fort Worth’s only elementary youth orchestra.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1928 edition. Volume: no.57 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing.

Stafford v. Goff, 609 F. Supp. 820 (D. Colo. 1985)





					U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado
											- 609 F. Supp. 820 (D. Colo. 1985)
									

May 25, 1985


609 F. Supp. 820 (1985)
Van STAFFORD and Lois Stafford, Plaintiffs,
v.
W.E. GOFF, John C. Statler, John Arbuthnot and Mark Schmidt, Defendants.
Civ. A. No. 85-C-629.
United States District Court, D. Colorado.
May 25, 1985.
*821 Van Stafford, pro se.
L. Richard Musat/Nancy Lopez, Hall and Evans, Denver, Colo., Rexford L. Mitchell, Mitchell & Mitchell, Rocky Ford, Colo., for defendants. 
ORDER
CARRIGAN, District Judge.
Plaintiffs, Van and Lois Stafford, brought this action, pro se, seeking damages under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986 for alleged violations of their civil and constitutional rights. Although it is difficult to decipher the factual bases for the plaintiffs' claims, it appears that the alleged violations stem from the filing and prosecuting of a foreclosure proceeding against the plaintiffs' farm under a Federal Land Bank of Wichita ("Bank") mortgage. Plaintiffs allege that the defendants, John C. Statler, District Judge for Baca County, Colorado; Willard Goff, Sheriff of Baca County; John Arbuthnot, Undersheriff of Baca County; and Mark Schmidt, local counsel for the Bank, all conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of their civil and constitutional rights.
Defendants have moved to dismiss on the grounds of immunity and failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The parties have briefed the issues, and oral argument would not assist in resolving them. 
1. Claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1985 and 1986.

In order to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1985, the plaintiff must allege a "racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirator's action." Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88, 102, 91 S. Ct. 1790, 1798, 29 L. Ed. 2d 338 (1970). There is no such allegation in the plaintiffs' complaint. Therefore, the plaintiffs' § 1985 claim must be dismissed. Because a claim for relief under § 1986 is dependent upon the existence of a valid claim under § 1985, the plaintiffs' § 1986 claim must also be dismissed. Brown v. Chaffee, 612 F.2d 497 (10th Cir. 1979). 
2. Claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Plaintiffs seek damages from Judge Statler for allegedly depriving them of property by "signing several documents." They also allege that Judge Statler "knew or reasonably should have known of the fact that Mark Schmidt was not duly authorized to represent an instrumentality of the federal government, and also knew that the Federal Land Bank was foreclosing on a credit instrument." These actions are claimed to be a conspiracy in violation of the plaintiffs' civil and constitutional rights.
It is clear that a judge is absolutely immune from liability for damages under § 1983 for actions arising out of the performance of his judicial functions unless he acted "in the clear absence of all jurisdiction." Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349, 357, 98 S. Ct. 1099, 1105, 55 L. Ed. 2d 331 (1978). Plaintiffs argue that Judge Statler was without jurisdiction to enter the orders which led to the foreclosure because the District Court of Baca County did not have subject matter jurisdiction over the action. In support of this argument, the plaintiffs *822 cite 28 U.S.C. § 1338 which vests in the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all actions arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents. Plaintiffs argue that a land patent, which is the original source of their title, is at issue and therefore that the Baca County Court had no jurisdiction over this matter. This argument is wholly without merit; the cited statute obviously does not apply. Judge Statler and the Baca County Court clearly had jurisdiction to hear the foreclosure action, and therefore Judge Statler is absolutely immune from liability for damages. His motion to dismiss is therefore granted.
With respect to the claims against Sheriff Goff and Undersheriff Arbuthnot, these defendants are protected by a qualified immunity. Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 87 S. Ct. 1213, 18 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1967). In order to avoid dismissal of the claims against these two, the plaintiffs must allege that they knew or reasonably should have known that the plaintiffs' constitutional rights were being violated by their actions. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). See also Davis v. Sherer, ___ U.S. ___, 104 S. Ct. 3012, 82 L. Ed. 2d 139 (1984). (Defendant who otherwise passes the Harlow qualified immunity test regarding clearly settled constitutional law does not lose qualified immunity for violating clearly settled state law.)
In this case, the plaintiffs have not alleged that these two defendants knew or should have known that they were violating the plaintiffs' rights. Therefore, Goff and Arbuthnot are protected by qualified immunity. The alleged violation of a state statute does not abrogate this immunity. Davis. Therefore, the motion of the defendants Goff and Arbuthnot to dismiss is granted.
Finally, the plaintiffs' claim against Mark Schmidt is based on allegations of conspiracy between Mr. Schmidt and the other defendants. The law requires that factual allegations supporting a claim of conspiracy under § 1983 be pleaded with particularity. Although a pro se complaint must be construed as liberally as possible, White v. Commissioner, 537 F. Supp. 679 (D.Colo.1982), mere conclusory assertions are insufficient. In Sooner Products Co. v. McBride, 708 F.2d 510 (10th Cir.1983), the Tenth Circuit stated: "When a plaintiff in a § 1983 action attempts to assert the necessary `state action' by implicating state officials or judges in a conspiracy with private defendants, mere conclusory allegations with no supporting factual averments are insufficient; the pleadings must specifically present facts tending to show agreement and concerted action. Clulow v. Oklahoma, 700 F.2d 1291, 1303 (10th Cir.1983). The standard is even stricter where the state officials allegedly involved in the conspiracy are immune from suit, as are the state court judges here. Shaffer v. Cook, 634 F.2d 1259, 1260 (10th Cir.1980) (per curiam), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 984, 101 S. Ct. 2316, 68 L. Ed. 2d 840 (1981); Norton v. Liddel, 620 F.2d 1375, 1380 (10th Cir.1980)" Id. at 512
Plaintiffs' complaint does not satisfy this standard. All claims against the defendant Schmidt therefore shall be dismissed.
Accordingly, it is ordered that the complaint and action as against Judge John C. Statler, Sheriff Willard Goff, and Undersheriff John Arbuthnot are dismissed with prejudice. The complaint and action as against the defendant Mark Schmidt are dismissed without prejudice.
