Company Overview[edit]
Cynapsus is a specialty pharmaceutical company developing the only oral (sublingual) delivery of the only approved drug (apomorphine) to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. Over one million people in the United States and an estimated 5 million people globally suffer from Parkinson's disease. Parkinson’s disease is a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disease that impacts motor activity, and its prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. Based on the IMPACT Registry Study and the results of Cynapsus’ Global 500 Neurologists Survey, it is estimated that between 25 percent and 50 percent of patients experience “off” episodes in which they have impaired movement or speaking capabilities. Current medications only control the disease’s symptoms, and most drugs become less effective over time as the disease progresses.
Cynapsus’ lead drug candidate, APL-130277, is an easy-to-administer, fast-acting and oral reformulation of an approved drug, apomorphine, used to rescue patients from “off” episodes. Cynapsus is focused on rapidly maximizing the value of APL-130277 by completing pivotal studies in advance of a New Drug Application expected to be submitted in 2015. Cynapsus anticipates out-licensing to an appropriate pharmaceutical partner before such an application is submitted.
Products[edit]
APL-130277[edit]
APL-130277 is a reformulation of an approved Parkinson’s drug. APL-130277 is a novel oral formulation of an approved drug for Parkinson‘s patients designed to deliver significant clinical benefits over the current marketed treatment. The drug will treat patients with moderate to severe PD and address a significant unmet clinical need as expressed by clinicians and patients. The drug is expected to undergo accelerated approval through 505(b)(2) FDA regulatory pathway with the US FDA and a similar pathway with other international regulatory agencies. This well developed regulatory path could result in a New Drug Approval application being submitted in late 2014 or early 2015. APL-130277 has the potential to address a significant underserved portion of $3 Billion+ Parkinson’s Disease market.
Cynapsus has entered into an agreement with Adagio Pharmaceuticals Ltd. granting Cynapsus the option to execute a proposed exclusive, worldwide agreement to license all intellectual property relating to and issued from continuing development APL-130277.

MARLBOROUGH, Mass. & TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sunovion 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Sunovion”) and Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. 
      (“Cynapsus”) today announced that Sunovion has completed, through its 
      wholly owned subsidiary, Sunovion CNS Development Canada ULC (the 
      “Purchaser”), the previously announced acquisition of Cynapsus (the 
      “Acquisition”).
    


      The Acquisition is aligned with Sunovion’s global strategy to expand and 
      diversify its portfolio in key therapeutic areas, including neurology. 
      Sunovion intends to advance the clinical development program for a novel 
      formulation of apomorphine (“APL-130277”), which is a product candidate 
      designed to be a fast-acting, easy-to-use, sublingual thin film for the 
      on-demand management of OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease 
      (“PD”).
    

      “OFF episodes impair the ability to move and maintain normal activities 
      and are often highly distressing to people with Parkinson’s disease,” 
      said Nobuhiko Tamura, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sunovion. 
      “We look forward to the completion of the clinical development program 
      for the sublingual formulation of apomorphine, which, if approved, will 
      be an important treatment option for OFF episodes associated with 
      Parkinson’s disease. Sunovion’s acquisition of Cynapsus reinforces our 
      vision to lead the way to a healthier world and our commitment to 
      patients who are at the center of everything we do.”
    

      Beneficial holders of common shares (“Shares”) and common share purchase 
      warrants (“Warrants”) of Cynapsus are not required to take any action in 
      respect of the closing of the Acquisition as payment is expected to be 
      credited to the beneficial holders’ intermediary accounts through 
      established procedures. Beneficial securityholders should contact their 
      intermediary if they have any questions regarding this process. 
      Registered holders of Cynapsus securities must submit certificates 
      representing their securities and complete, sign, date and return the 
      Letter of Transmittal sent to them with the other materials for the 
      special meeting of Cynapsus securityholders held on October 13, 2016, in 
      order to receive the consideration to which they are entitled. 
      Registered Cynapsus securityholders who have not yet submitted the 
      certificates for their securities and Letters of Transmittal are 
      encouraged to do so as soon as possible. Any questions regarding payment 
      of consideration for Registered securityholders, including any request 
      for another copy of the Letter of Transmittal, should be directed to TSX 
      Trust Company, via telephone at 1-800-600-5869 (toll free North America) 
      or via email at TMXEInvestorServices@tmx.com.
    

      In connection with the Acquisition, the Purchaser acquired 13,520,414 
      Shares and 1,885,452 Warrants, representing 100% of the outstanding 
      Shares and Warrants, respectively. Holders of Shares received US$40.50 
      (or approximately CAD$53.62) in cash per Share and holders of Warrants 
      received US$40.50 (or approximately CAD$53.62) in cash per Warrant, less 
      the exercise price of such Warrant. The Acquisition values Cynapsus 
      (including all Shares, Warrants and stock options of Cynapsus) at 
      approximately US$635 million (or approximately CAD$841 million). As a 
      result of the Acquisition, Cynapsus has become a wholly-owned subsidiary 
      of Sunovion and the common shares of Cynapsus will cease to be traded on 
      the NASDAQ Stock Market and Toronto Stock Exchange.
    

      The Acquisition was completed by way of a plan of arrangement under the 
      Canada Business Corporations Act (the “Arrangement”). Cynapsus will 
      continue under the laws of the province of British Columbia, following 
      which the Purchaser, Cynapsus and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cynapsus 
      will amalgamate (the “Amalgamation”). Sunovion will be the sole 
      shareholder of the amalgamated company, to be named Sunovion CNS 
      Development Canada ULC (“Amalco”). Following the Amalgamation, Amalco 
      will distribute substantially all of its assets to Sunovion. The Shares 
      are expected to be delisted from the NASDAQ Stock Market and the Toronto 
      Stock Exchange in due course and Sunovion and Amalco intend to apply for 
      Cynapsus to cease to be a reporting issuer. In addition, as is customary 
      following a transaction of this nature, the directors of Cynapsus 
      resigned following the completion of the Arrangement, and were replaced 
      by the then directors of the Purchaser, who will remain the directors of 
      Amalco.
    

About APL-130277APL-130277, a novel formulation of 
      apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, is being developed as a fast-acting, 
      easy-to-use, sublingual thin film for the on-demand management of 
      debilitating OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). 
      Apomorphine is the only molecule approved for acute, intermittent 
      treatment of OFF episodes for advanced PD patients, but in the United 
      States is currently only approved as a subcutaneous injection. 
      APL-130277 is designed to rapidly, safely and reliably convert a PD 
      patient from the OFF to the ON state while avoiding many of the issues 
      associated with subcutaneous delivery of apomorphine. It has been 
      studied in all types of OFF episodes, including morning OFF episodes. 
      APL-130277 is in Phase 3 clinical trials and has not been approved by 
      the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
    

      If the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials are successful, it is 
      expected that a New Drug Application (NDA) for APL-130277 will be 
      submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the 
      first half of Fiscal Year 2017 under the abbreviated Section 505(b)(2) 
      regulatory pathway.
    

About Parkinson’s Disease and OFF EpisodesMore than 1 
      million people in the U.S. and an estimated 4 to 6 million people 
      worldwide suffer from Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD is a chronic, 
      progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms, 
      including tremor at rest, rigidity and impaired movement, as well as 
      significant non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment and mood 
      disorders. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease behind 
      Alzheimer’s disease, and PD’s prevalence is increasing with the aging of 
      the population. OFF episodes are a complication of the disease. Up to 40 
      percent of all people with PD whose symptoms are otherwise managed with 
      ongoing drug therapy experience OFF episodes at least once daily and up 
      to six times daily, with each episode typically lasting between 30 and 
      120 minutes.i,ii

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc is a Canada-based specialty central nervous system (CNS) pharmaceutical company. It develops a sublingual thin film for the potential treatment for on-demand management of debilitating OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). The Company completed a Phase two clinical trial for its product candidate, APL-130277, a sublingual formulation of apomorphine hydrochloride, or apomorphine. Apomorphine is the only molecule approved for acute, intermittent treatment of OFF episodes for advanced PD patients, but is currently only approved as a subcutaneous injection in the United States. APL-130277 is a turning ON medication designed to convert a PD patient from the OFF to the ON state while avoiding the issues associated with subcutaneous delivery of apomorphine. It is designed to convert all types of OFF episodes, including morning OFF episodes. Furthermore, the Company has initiated its pivotal Phase three clinical program for APL-130277.

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion.

Restoring Movement With Ease

- Description
Overdrive was commissioned to rebrand Cynapsus Therapeutics in 2010 including collateral and website. Overdrive was then engaged again in 2014 for a brand strategy exercise and rebuild of the older site. With the client’s signature pharmaceutical property for treating Parkinson’s Disease symptoms moving closer towards commercialization, the outcomes of the brand strategy exercise indicated a focus on three main interest groups - patients, professional practitioners and investors. This approach would be changed many times in the completion of the website which was launched in early 2016, but the overall design remained largely intact.
The goal was to create a website with multiple sections tracked to different site user demographics, each section containing easily digestible content written in a light/accessible tone. Deeper content is available in an archive of press releases and technical scientific documents hosted in a site database.
Visually, the centrepiece of the site are a series of fullscreen looping videos created with award winning cinematography Iris Ng. These are featured on the site’s landing page and are intended to illustrate the benefit of Cynapsus’ product to a typically older end user - that being the relief of freezing episodes and restoring physical movement for everyday activities.

(Sunovion) and Cynapsus Therapeutics Inc. (Cynapsus) (CYNA) (CTH.TO) today announced that the companies have signed a definitive agreement under which Sunovion will acquire Cynapsus for US$40.50 per share in cash.

The acquisition will be funded with cash on hand. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 (third quarter of Sunovion’s fiscal year).

Giovinazzo, President and CEO, Cynapsus. “This transaction culminates years of dedicated work by the Cynapsus team and represents significant value creation for our securityholders.”The board of directors of Cynapsus, after consultation with its financial and legal advisors and based, in part, upon the unanimous recommendation of an independent special committee of the board of directors, has determined that the arrangement is in the best interest of Cynapsus and the consideration to be received by shareholders of Cynapsus is fair to such shareholders. The board of directors unanimously recommends that Cynapsus shareholders and warrantholders vote in favour of the transaction at a special meeting expected to be held on or about October 13, 2016.The proposed sale of Cynapsus follows a full consideration of alternatives aimed at optimizing shareholder value for the company. “We believe that the proposed transaction with Sunovion results in the best outcome for our shareholders,” said Rochelle Stenzler, chair of the board of Cynapsus. “The transaction with Sunovion represents a significant premium to the current share price and we are recommending that our shareholders and warrantholders vote in favour of the transaction.”Pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement, upon closing of the proposed transaction, shareholders of Cynapsus will receive US$40.50 per common share in cash, and holders of warrants and stock options will receive a cash payment equal to the difference between US$40.50 and the exercise price of such warrant or stock option. The offer of US$40.50 per common share in cash represents a premium of 123 percent based on the volume weighted average closing price of Cynapsus’ common shares on the NASDAQ Global Market for the last twenty trading days. The companies expect to close the transaction following required securityholder, court and regulatory approvals and satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions.The transaction will be completed by way of a plan of arrangement under the Canada Business Corporations Act. The arrangement will require approval of at least two-thirds of the votes cast by Cynapsus shareholders and warrantholders voting together as a single class at a special meeting of such securityholders of Cynapsus. Voting and Support Agreements in support of the transaction have been signed by all directors and officers of Cynapsus and the company’s largest shareholder representing in the aggregate, approximately 18.33 percent of the Cynapsus securities entitled to vote to approve the transaction.Read MoreFull details of the transaction will be included in the management information circular to be filed with the applicable securities regulatory authorities and mailed to Cynapsus shareholders and warrant holders within approximately two weeks. Assuming receipt of all required regulatory approvals, the parties expect to close the arrangement in the fourth quarter of 2016.BofA Merrill Lynch serves as financial advisor, and Borden Ladner Gervais LLP and Troutman Sanders LLP serve as legal advisors to Cynapsus. Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated serves as financial advisor and Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP serves as a legal advisor to the Special Committee of Cynapsus. Nomura Securities International, Inc. serves as exclusive financial advisor, and Goodmans LLP, Reed Smith LLP, and Gibbons PC serve as legal advisors to Sunovion.Adagio Amending AgreementCynapsus and the former shareholders of Adagio Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Adagio”) entered into a share purchase agreement dated as of December 22, 2011, as subsequently amended as of January 28, 2015 (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), pursuant to which Cynapsus acquired Adagio.Cynapsus and the former shareholders of Adagio have amended the Share Purchase Agreement to provide, among other things, that if a change of control of Cynapsus, which would include the transaction with Sunovion, occurs before the successful completion and the first public announcement of the top-line data of the Final Safety Study (as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement), the CDN$2,500,000 of the purchase price still potentially payable to the former shareholders of Adagio shall be paid in cash (not common shares, as was originally contemplated in the Share Purchase Agreement) by Cynapsus, on the date on which the change of control transaction is completed.As Anthony Giovinazzo, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cynapsus, is also a director, officer and majority shareholder of Adagio, the amendment of the Share Purchase Agreement constitutes a related party transaction pursuant to Multilateral Instrument 61-101 and the policies of the TSX. The amendment was necessary, and appropriate, as it ensures that if Sunovion acquires all of the common shares of Cynapsus, it would not have an obligation to potentially issue shares to the former Adagio shareholders post-closing of such acquisition. The amendment was entered into at the same time as the arrangement agreement with Sunovion and therefore was not announced more than 21 days before its execution.About APL-130277APL-130277, a novel formulation of apomorphine, a dopamine agonist, is being developed as a fast-acting, easy-to-use, sublingual thin film for the on-demand management of debilitating OFF episodes associated with Parkinson’s disease. Apomorphine is the only molecule approved for acute, intermittent treatment of OFF episodes for advanced PD patients, but is currently only approved as a subcutaneous injection in the United States. APL-130277 is designed to rapidly, safely and reliably convert a PD patient from the OFF to the ON state while avoiding many of the issues associated with subcutaneous delivery of apomorphine. It has been studied in all types of OFF episodes, including morning OFF episodes. APL-130277 is in Phase 3 clinical trials and has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).In the ongoing Phase 3 trial, CTH-300, the blinded safety data was corroborated by the DSMB findings, which were announced in the press release dated August 15, 2016. If the ongoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials are successful, it is expected that a New Drug Application (NDA) for APL-130277 will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) during the first half of 2017 under the abbreviated Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. A pivotal European clinical program evaluating the safety and efficacy of APL-130277 in PD patients is expected to be initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016.About Parkinson’s Disease and OFF EpisodesMore than 1 million people in the U.S. and an estimated 4 to 6 million people worldwide suffer from PD. The European Parkinson's disease Association estimates that 1.2 million people have PD in the European Union. PD is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor symptoms, including tremor at rest, rigidity and impaired movement, as well as significant non-motor symptoms, including cognitive impairment and mood disorders. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease behind Alzheimer’s disease, and PD’s prevalence is increasing with the aging of the population. OFF episodes are a complication of the disease. Up to 40 percent of all people with PD whose symptoms are otherwise managed with ongoing drug therapy experience OFF episodes at least once daily and up to six times daily, with each episode typically lasting between 30 and 120 minutes.1,2About Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.
