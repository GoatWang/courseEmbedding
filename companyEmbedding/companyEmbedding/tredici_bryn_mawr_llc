Tredici, Greg Dodge’s stylish Italian/Mediterranean wine bar at 13th and Sansom Streets, has gone over the top for its Bryn Mawr location, opening Friday, June 16 in the new Bryn Mawr Village (915 W. Lancaster Ave., 484-381-0268).

The center, just west of Merion Avenue, is home of branch locations of La Colombe, Bryn & Dane’s, and Turning Point.
It’s one of the most glamorous Main Line newcomers in memory.

For Enoteca Tredici, Boxwood Architects worked with skylighted 25-foot ceilings, installing globe lights, two live 16-foot ficus trees, Carrara marble counter tops, charcuterie and raw counter up front, and touches of black and gold, all set on herringbone hardwood floors.

The 18-seat bar is ringed by casual standing space for cocktails, and assorted dining areas, including one glassed-in room with a high-top table that can seat 30.

The menu builds on those served in Washington Square West and in Washington, D.C., by adding 8-inch pizzas inspired by sister restaurant Zavino. There’s a “secret” menu item, too: a take on Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s truffle pizza.)
Flatbreads and pastas are in the mid- to high-teens, and most mains start at $19 (burger) and linger in the $20s.
That’s half of a steel buoy over a table at Enoteca Tredici, 915 W. Lancaster Ave., Bryn Mawr.    MICHAEL KLEIN / Staff
Hours are 4 to 10 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday; brunch will be added soon. There’s free self- and valet parking.

Greg Dodge and crew are headed to the Main Line this summer for a third location of Zavino, their casual Italian pizza/wine bar. They also are setting up a restaurant in Washington, D.C., that will resemble their more recent Washington Square West opening, the more refined Tredici.



Dodge said work would begin in May for the third Zavino, which will join future tenants La Colombe and Bryn & Dane's at Bryn Mawr Village in an existing building on the site, on Lancaster Avenue just west of Merion Avenue. (The Philadelphia Business Journal detailed Zavino's expansion earlier this week.)
At 5,000 square feet, this Zavino location will be larger than the original at 13th and Sansom Streets and the offshoot in Chestnut Square on the Drexel campus. Dodge said it would feel even more spacious because the building - a former truck garage - has 23-foot ceilings with no columns. Live trees will grow inside, as skylights are being punched in the roof.

He said he hoped the restaurant would open in September.
Dodge also said his company would develop an Italian restaurant at the St. Gregory Hotel & Suites at 21st and M Street NW in the DuPont Circle neighborhood in Washington, which was bought last year by Philadelphia's Hersha Hospitality.
Dodge described that restaurant as "more Tredici-esque." Work is due to begin in June and wrap this fall. 



 


(Coincidence: Fifteen years ago, Dodge was general manager of Pod while the chef was Michael Schulson, who now owns Sampan and now Double Knot on the same stretch of 13th Street as Zavino and Tredici.)

Enoteca Tredici to Debut in Bryn Mawr — The Town Dish

Enoteca Tredici to Debut in Bryn Mawr



This June, owner Greg Dodge of Zavino Hospitality Group will open Enoteca Tredici in Bryn Mawr, the third location of his acclaimed Mediterranean restaurant and bar. The Bryn Mawr restaurant and bar is a homecoming for Dodge, who lives nearby with his wife Emily and their two children and looks forward to bringing approachable Italian-inspired dishes and diverse wines to his friends and neighbors.
“Bringing Tredici home to the Main Line is an exciting step for me, both personally and professionally,” says Dodge, whose other Tredici locations, in Center City Philadelphia and Washington DC, have quickly established themselves as local favorites. “This restaurant feels personal to me, right down to serving a signature falafel recipe from my wife, Emily, on our Mediterranean Board. It’s deeply satisfying to bring Tredici to Bryn Mawr, where it feels like such a natural, comfortable fit for us.”

At 5,000 square feet, Enoteca Tredici is the group’s largest location so far, and will be located in a sprawling warehouse space within Bryn Mawr Village at 915-925 West Lancaster Avenue. Guests can expect a familiar menu of Mediterranean cuisine, including shareable small plates and more sizable entrees, as well as a thoughtful and diverse selection of wines by the glass and by the bottle.
Notable menu highlights will include:

Mushroom toast with maitake mushrooms and crème fraîche
Eggplant parmesan with burrata and tomato-vodka sauce
Mediterranean board with flatbread, hummus, Emily’s falafel and tzatziki
A rotating crudo of the day
Flatbreads, including The Stache, with pistachio pesto, mozzarella, parmesan, lemon vinaigrette and baby arugula, a favorite at Dodge’s wood-fired pizza concept, Zavino
Broccoli and avocado with black sesame and dijon vinaigrette
Squid ink tonarelli with cocktails, shishito pepper and white wine-garlic cream sauce
Flat iron chicken with brown butter-lemon sauce


The space itself is a perfect backdrop for the approachable fare, with herringbone hardwood floors, soaring 25’ ceilings, Carrara marble countertops and touches of black and gold. Artfully arranged fresh flowers will complement a canopy of 16’ live trees beneath expansive skylights. An 18-seat bar, surrounded by additional casual standing space for cocktails, sets a lively scene, while a pair of private dining areas accommodate groups of up to 32 and up to 100, respectively. Both are outfitted with state-of-the-art audiovisual capabilities and equipment.
Enoteca Tredici will be open from 4 p.m. until 10 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, and closed on Mondays. Brunch hours will be added in the weeks following the opening. Free on-site parking is available, along with a complimentary valet. Reservations are available via Reserve, and the restaurant will also offer delivery through Caviar.
Enoteca Tredici will be located at 915 W. Lancaster Ave. in Bryn Mawr.

Enoteca Tredici Wows Bryn Mawr with an Alluring Taste of the Big City — The Town Dish

Enoteca Tredici Wows Bryn Mawr with an Alluring Taste of the Big City



The Town Dish staff had the opportunity to be the very first table seated at the friends and family event of the Main Line area’s newest—and quite enthralling—Enoteca Tredici on Wednesday, June 14. Figuring we might experience the proverbial hiccup or two from a somewhat freshman staff, we were pleasantly surprised that our initial visit was a resounding success right out of the gate.
Our team was enamored over the slick mix of the classic and urban design of Enoteca Tredici, and owner Greg Dodge’s enthusiasm became evident when we asked about the new space. “I like to ‘borrow’ ideas from some of my favorite restaurants, and I’ve incorporated many of those elements with a personal flair into the Bryn Mawr design.” During a brief personal tour, we were shown handcrafted dramatic lighting fixtures, the bustling open design kitchen, secluded yet expansive private dining rooms, the 18-seat bar and (in our opinion) the most comfortable and unique bar stools anywhere. Be forewarned to sit, sip and sip some more.
Greg, of Zavino Hospitality Group, opened this fourth location of his already-acclaimed list of restaurants located at 13th and Sansom St. and University City in Philadelphia, and at the St. Gregory Hotel in Washington, D.C. He was looking to find a spot a bit closer to where he and his family live, and the opportunity to join Bryn Mawr Village with other new local favorites La Colombe, Bryn + Dane’s and Turning Point was too good to pass up.








The 5,000-square-foot, almost warehouse-like interior blends well-placed curved half walls, artsy open-shelving, reflective mirrors and windows that actually create a sense of intimacy in the sprawling space. Tredici continues to pull out all the stops with herringbone hardwood floors, carrara marble countertops laden with well-produced floral centerpieces, more polished glass, silver and serving plates and accents among a tall canopy of 16’ live trees and skylights.
While architecturally superior, we know it’s the food that drives the Zavino model of success. The menu here is focused, yet diverse and sharable. We tasted a well-presented raw bar sampler ($35) that included oysters, crab claws and plump shrimp. A 12-inch flatbread ($16) named The Stache was hot and plentiful with pistachio pesto, mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses with a light lemon vinaigrette and arugula. A small plate of spiced Moroccan ribs were sweet and fell off the bone directly into our mouths. Other pasta, meat and vegetarian dishes on the menu are set up to be sharable as well, and we favor that line of culinary adventure.

The bar selections are inspired and playful with cocktails like the Papi Collins (a tall-sized summer sipper with Revivalist gin, thyme and Prosecco), the Tredici Daiquiri (love this modern twist on a classic drink) and a sharp concoction called the Razor, which starts with our local favorite, Stateside Vodka. A full list of reds and whites by the glass or bottle are ready to be uncorked and a craft beer list is brief, but effective.

The staff was friendly, well-groomed, well-prepared, knowledgeable (of both the bar and food menus) and smiled in all the right places, which really is a pleasure these days.
Enoteca Tredici is open from 4–10 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, 4–11 p.m., Friday and Saturday and closed on Monday. Brunch hours will be added in the near future, so stay in the know on Facebook, Instagram and the Enoteca Tredici website.
