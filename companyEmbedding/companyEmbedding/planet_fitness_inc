Get to Know Our Planet Fitness Gyms  






Welcome to Our PlanetMake yourself comfy. Because we’re Judgement Free. It doesn’t matter if your legs have never seen a squat machine before. We believe how you work out is totally up to you. Take advantage of our unlimited fitness training programs or just do your own thing on the treadmill, we’ll cheer you on either way - if you’re in our house you deserve a little cred just for being here.We believe no one should ever feel Gymtimidated by Lunky behavior and that everyone should feel at ease in our gyms, no matter what his or her workout goals are. And everyone should have access to lots of nice new equipment and feel comfortable asking for help. With all of these great benefits under one roof, we like to say:We’re not a gym. We’re Planet Fitness.The Judgement Free Zone®Planet Fitness is known for a lot of things – our low prices (and all the stuff you get for those low prices), our Lunk™ Alarm, and of course, our Judgement Free Zone®. We’re fiercely protective of our Planet and the rights of our members to feel like they belong. So we create an environment where you can relax, go at your own pace and just do your own thing without ever having to worry about being judged. This is your Planet. You belong.Really, Planet Fitness just makes a lot of sense. (And if you think about it, cents.)

Need Help?
You've come to the right place! Our goal is to deliver legendary customer service to our members at all times.
As each club is a privately owned franchise, the best place to get help to your questions and concerns is in your
home club.
Call or stop by your home club location and speak with a staff member at the front desk, they will be more than happy to assist you.


Contact your home club

FAQ
How do I cancel my membership?

We hate to see you go! But if you must, the process is easy. You can fill out a cancellation form at the front desk of your home club, or send a letter (preferably via certified mail) to your club requesting cancellation. Memberships can’t, unfortunately, be cancelled by email or phone.
Please remember that your cancellation request is subject to any obligations of your membership agreement. Your club staff will be able to review the terms of your membership agreement and answer any questions you have.
If you are cancelling because you’re unsatisfied with your Planet Fitness location, please speak with your local club manager before making your final decision. We love feedback and would love the opportunity to improve and hopefully change your mind!

 How do I transfer my membership to a different Planet Fitness club?

You can transfer your membership online with just a few clicks, starting here (you’ll need your Planet Fitness keytag number). A few things to be aware of before you transfer: You have to have been a member at one location for at least ninety days, you must have a monthly (not annual) membership, and you can’t owe any outstanding dues or fees at your current club.

 How do I upgrade (or downgrade) my membership?

Upgrading your membership has never been faster or easier. You can do it all online simply by clicking here (you’ll need your PF keytag number). Or, stop by the club and our front desk staff can do it for you. Club staff can also help you downgrade your membership.

 Where do I go if I have questions or need help with the billing for my account?

Your local club is the best place to go for help with any billing-related issues (including requesting refunds). If you simply need to update your billing information or review your membership agreement, you can do that online by clicking here.

 How do I log in to my Planet Fitness account online?

That one is easy! Click here.

 Why do you need my checking account for a membership?

The method in which members are able to pay for their monthly membership varies by location, but many Planet Fitness clubs accept payment through checking accounts only. We require an Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) through checking accounts for your convenience: This allows us to be able to continue your membership without interruption or the hassle of updating your payment information if your credit cards are lost/stolen, invalid or expired.

When is my annual fee due?

Annual fees are billed to a member once per year. Your annual fee billing date is dependent on your join date and membership type. A staff member at your club can help you determine when your annual fee date is. 

How old do I have to be to get a membership?

You can join PF starting at the age of 13 with a parent/legal guardian’s permission; they must be present with you during the sign-up process. Members between the ages of 13 and 15 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian when they work out.
Members who are 16 or 17 years old must have a signed waiver from a parent or guardian on file.
Please note that any PF Black Card® guests must be 18 years old with a valid ID, unless they’re accompanied by a parent or guardian. 

Do you offer classes or personal training?

We offer [email protected] – a series of focused fitness training sessions led by certified fitness instructors that’s designed to help members get familiar with the equipment and to build an individual workout plan to follow at their own pace. [email protected] sessions are done in small groups, free to our members, and available on a first-come, first-served basis. We encourage people to sign up in advance, as they fill up quickly!
You can find our [email protected] class schedules on the web page for your club (search for it here), at the front desk in your club, or on the PF App (if you haven’t downloaded the app already, you can find it in the Apple Store or Google Play).  

Do you offer childcare? Are my kids allowed in the club while I’m working out?

In order to keep our membership cost conveniently low, we do not offer childcare services. And for the safety of children under the age of 13, we ask that they do not come into the facility.
We do try to keep our clubs open as long as possible to accommodate all schedules. Check with your local club for their hours.

 What’s the dress code?

We’re all for people expressing themselves, but do ask that clothing that may be perceived as intimidating, revealing, or offensive not be worn in the club. We also do not allow clothing that may present safety hazards or damage equipment. Examples of clothing that is not allowed include:

Open-toed shoes or sandals
Mud-caked, greasy, or soiled shoes or clothing
Jeans or pants with prominent grommets
Clothing with messaging that a reasonable person may find offensive or otherwise inappropriate

 Do you know you’re spelling “judgement” the wrong way?

Yep. Spelling judgement with an ‘e’ started out as a mistake. We considered changing it to the traditional spelling years ago, but decided to keep it because it fit with our brand personality—we are judgment free on all matters, so what better way to demonstrate this than by keeping the original incorrect spelling?

About Planet Fitness


We are one of the largest and fastest-growing franchisors and operators of fitness centers in the United States by number of members and locations, with a highly recognized national brand. Our mission is to enhance people’s lives by providing a high-quality fitness experience in a welcoming, non-intimidating environment, which we call the Judgement Free Zone, where anyone – and we mean anyone – can feel they belong.
Our bright, clean locations are typically 20,000 square feet, with a large selection of high-quality, purple and yellow Planet Fitness-branded cardio, circuit- and weight-training equipment and friendly staff trainers who offer unlimited free fitness instruction to all our members in small groups through our PE@PF program. We offer this differentiated fitness experience at only $10 per month for our standard membership. This exceptional value proposition is designed to appeal to a broad population, including occasional gym users and the approximately 80% of the U.S. and Canadian populations over age 14 who are not gym members, particularly those who find the traditional fitness club setting intimidating and expensive. We and our franchisees fiercely protect Planet Fitness’ community atmosphere where progress toward achieving your fitness goals, big or small, is supported and applauded by our staff and fellow members.
