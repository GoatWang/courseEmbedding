CD'sApple I PhoneLaptopTypewriterI Pad / Tablet ComputersWhat does it all mean?Wii3D TVIntroduction Stage – This stage of the cycle could be the most expensive for a company launching a new product. The size of the market for the product is small, which could cause low sales. A company will research, develop, test and launch a product which can result in high costs, especially if it’s a competitive market.Growth Stage – The growth stage is the part where sales of a product will increase at their fastest rate. An increase in sales allows the company to invest the profits in promotion, maximizing the number of sales at this stage.Maturity Stage – During the maturity stage, the product is established and sales are at their highest. The aim for the manufacturer is now to maintain the market they have built up. New competition can create a busy market and sales can start to slow down. With cleaver advertising and improvements to the product, sales can continue to grow. This helps to keep the product ahead of the competition, these are known as Extension Strategies. Decline Stage – Eventually, sales of the product will start to slow, and this is what’s known as the decline stage. This could be due to the competition in the market or that the majority of the customers have already brought the product.
