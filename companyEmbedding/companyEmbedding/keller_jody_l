Jake is a Make-A-Wish child and L'BRI helped him take his wish trip.  Jake is a seven-year-old boy who likes to play at the park and play baseball. H...e also likes the beach and dolphins. He wished to go to Florida with his family to visit Sea World and see the beach. Thanks to L'BRI'S support, his wish came true.  His journey began with a road trip from Wisconsin to Florida. Jake and his family made a few fun stops along the way. When they arrived in Orlando, they stayed in their own private bungalow at a special resort designed just for wish children - Give Kids The World Village. They took advantage of all the resort had to offer, including headed swimming pools, a movie theater, ice cream parlor and a dinosaur themed miniature golf course.  They discovered all the magic of Disney and spent a day at the beach and swam in the Atlantic Ocean. One of the highlights came when Jake and his family uncovered the mysteries of the deep at SeaWorld, where they participated in the Dolphin Spotlight Tour, learning to train and take care of the dolphins.  It was a wish come true. Jake and his family returned home with priceless memories, giving them hope, strength and joy for years to come.

Pictures taken 4 1/2 days apart: My baby girl was around 4 weeks old when she started getting baby acne. It spread like crazy and concerned me when patches of her skin turned red, dry, and scaly. I was told by the doctor that she had dermatitis and the best thing was to either just leave it alone and it would eventually go away, or I could use Aquaphor. I wasn't crazy about putting something so greasy on her face. I was recommended t...o use L'BRI so I tried it. I started washing her face with my L'BRI cleanser, I used the facial peel to remove the dead skin, and then used my facial moisturizer on her. Within hours the redness was gone and her face cleared up within two days! So thankful I used L'BRI on her and that her beautiful skin is back. ~Shannon, Ohio Stories like this make me so happy that I discovered L'BRI when I did and that I can feel good about recommending our products to everyone because they are aloe-based, safe, effective and affordable! PM me for more information and a free sample www.jkeller.lbri.com 展开Jodi Keller, L'BRI Executive Manager/Team Trainer of Day Dreamers Tribe · 2014年8月17日 · Here's the basics for the Buy 1 Get 6 FREE deal....
