Resources







With over 20 years of experience in the health care industry, accomplished pharmacist and entrepreneur Travis Leonardi began his vocation in pharmacy management after completing his Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy at the St. John’s University College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions in New York City. Capitalizing on the absence of business intelligence in the health care industry, Leonardi founded Sentry Data Systems, Inc., as a means of implementing business management technology in hospitals and pharmacies across the nation. Serving industry clients from 35 different states, he has helped introduce time-saving and economical products and data platforms, such as the Sentinel RCM (Revenue Cycle Manager), HealthBIT (Business Intelligence Technology), Sentrex, and Datanex applications. 
With each of these products, Travis Leonardi’s customers realized significant financial savings, operational efficiencies, and supplemental performance and, in general, drastically reduced workloads. Working in partnership with Omnicell, Inc., in 2010, Leonardi integrated Sentry Data Systems’ Sentinel RCM with Omnicell’s WorkflowRx software to provide a comprehensive inventory management system for state-of-the-art hospital pharmacies to operate in compliance with the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. Ever at the forefront of the pharmacy industry, Travis Leonardi is a member of the American Society of Consultant Pharmacists and the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, among other professional organizations.

Leonard was featured in the only commercial produced for Travel to Malaysia 2014 with Yeo's campaign; the video is available on the Hobart Ocean YouTube channel (http://youtu.be/5ALhkHxcWEI).The four fun, super-interesting L.A. transplants that joined forces as Hobart Ocean have shared their infectious energy with thousands of fans this past year with regular performances at Universal CityWalk, one of L.A.'s premier entertainment and retail venues.The high-energy band beat out over 150 other acts to secure a regular performance slot, and at times have played for 5-10,000 people a night for over four hours. One of their performances caught the attention of Jay Hu, a onetime marketing manager at Jive Records who is now Managing Director of Swift Endeavor. He signed them as the upstart label's flagship artist.Also an investment holding company, Yeo Hiap Seng Limited (commonly known as Yeo's) has offices and market presence in the U.S., Europe, Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan and many other countries.Image Available: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/frame_mw?attachid=2681514ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump is the most conflicted president in modern US history — and a new report highlights the dangersBusiness InsiderBaby Charlie protesters rally as hospital reports threatsAssociated PressMissy Elliott makes rare appearance for first U.S. show in decadeEntertainment WeeklyTrump, Russia, and the Presidential Pardon: What Exactly Can He Do?NewsweekSafety Tips For Watching The Solar EclipseInternational Business TimesHow 2 life-threatening events changed how Aetna's CEO views health careYahoo FinanceScaramucci quotes anonymous source on Russian hacking, then admits Trump was the sourceBusiness InsiderJeb Bush calls out Republicans who criticized Obama over Russia, but have been silent on the Trump-Russia probeBusiness InsiderAetna CEO Bertolini: How tech plays into the future of healthcareYahoo Finance VideoWhy it might be ‘dangerous’ for IBM to turn itself around: professorYahoo FinanceWhy sparkling water sales could spike by 20% in 2017Yahoo FinanceAmazon Is Going Underwater.

1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)
2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.
3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.
4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.
5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)
6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39. With Iranian sanctions being lifted Russia will find another inexpensive competitor increasing production and pushing Russia further down the list of suppliers. 
As for Iranian sanctions, the 6 countries lifting them allowing Iran to collect on the billions it is owed for pumping oil but not being paid for it. These billions Iran can only get if the Iranian nuclear deal is signed. Trump spoke of ending the deals which would cause oil sales sanctions to be reimposed, which would make Russian oil more competitive.
7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.
8) Putin cannot get access to these new cost saving technologies OR outside oil field development money, due to US sanctions on Russia, because of its involvement in Ukrainian civil war.
9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.
10) With Trump's fabricated hatred of NATO and the U.N., the Russian military reconstituted, the threat to the Baltic states is real. Russia retaking their access to the Baltic Sea from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia and threatening the shipping of millions of cubic feet of natural gas to lower Europe from Scandinavia, allowing Russia to make a good case for its oil and gas being piped into eastern Europe.Join the Conversation1 / 5146
