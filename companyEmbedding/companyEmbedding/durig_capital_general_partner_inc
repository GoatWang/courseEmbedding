 Here is the overall summary of the 42 bond reviews and recommendations (from 35 different issuers) that were sent to our clients over the past twelve months, between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. Listed further below are the recommendations that Durig Capital clients subsequently acquired, the yield indications and price they were acquired at, as well as their currently indicated value relative to par. Bond reviews are published on Seeking Alpha and on Bond-Yields.com. The summary table at the end of this review does not reflect any future fluctuations in bond valuations, nor does it include the gains or losses that have or might ultimately result from exchange rate currency changes from purchase to redemption. However, it does offer a reasonably quick snapshot of how our recommendations have been faring since adjusting our selection criteria midway through last year to bond market conditions and its ensuing volatility. Fourteen of these recommendations (from 10 different foreign corporations) were global corporate debt instruments issued in US dollars (aka, Yankee Bonds), and seven recommendations (from 6 different issuers) were debt instruments denominated in Canadian dollars. Each summary that follows lists the issuer, coupon rate, maturity, credit rating, the yields at the time of recommendation, the acquisition price, the current value indication (as a percentage of par), as well as a brief update of the issuer.
  35 US dollar debt recommendations, with average YTW indications* of 16.38%, were made for FX1. 42 mixed currency (US and Canadian dollar) debt recommendations, with average YTW indications* of 17.15%, were made for FX2.  7 foreign currency (Canadian dollar) debt additions, with average YTW indications* of 21.02%, were made for FX3. At the time of recommendation, these debt instruments had an average outstanding maturity of less than 44 months (3.65 years) at an overall indicated average price discount of about 82.63%, and an average coupon rate of over 6.91%. The average time remaining until maturity for these bonds is currently less than 33 months (or 2.7 years.) The current average price gain in principle if investing in all bonds equally is over 9%, please see the table below. Not included or calculated is the additional accrued interest that is earned with the issuer's coupon rate. As of today, three of the recommendations were not (or haven't yet been) acquired, and are therefore not included in the average price gain. ____________________________________________________________ *Yield indications at the time of recommendations for addition to individual portfolios and currently indicated values are not presented as overall or year to date performance averages. As a result of our institutional association, we may obtain better or differing yield/price executions for our clients than is initially indicated in our reports. ___________________________________________________________________________ 31.09% Legacy Reserves Issuer: Legacy Reserves (NASDAQ:LGCY)Bond Coupon: 8.0%Maturity: 12/01/2020Rating: Ca/CCC+Pays: Semi-annuallyPrice: 46.25Yield to Maturity: ~31.09%---------------------------------------Date of Review: 6/07/16Currently Priced at: 42.0 Legacy Reserves recently signed a joint development agreement which should help minimize capital expenditure requirements to add oil and gas production.
