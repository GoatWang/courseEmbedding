(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This Form 10Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 31, 2016 (the "Annual Report").  COMPANY OVERVIEW  Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 1, 1997 under the name of Avani Manufacturing (China) Inc. The Company changed its name to Genesis Water Technology on August 17, 1999, and to Supreme Group International, Inc. on December 24, 2000. On June 7, 2001, it changed its name to Amanasu Technologies Corporation. It changed its name again on December 21, 2007 to Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation. The Company is a development stage company, and has not conducted any operations or generated any revenue since its inception.  The Company's principal offices were relocated on April 1, 2010 from 115 East 57th Street 11th Floor New York, NY 10022, to 445 Park Avenue Center 10th floor New York, NY 10022 Telephone: 604-790-8799. The Tokyo branch has relocated from 3-7-11 Azabujuubann Minato-Ku Tokyo Japan to Suite 905, 1-6-1 Senzoku Taito-Ku Tokyo Japan. Telephone: 03-5808-3663.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  The Company has 2 technologies which the Company believes have great market potential. The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc., a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts. The second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology, extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now seeking, manufacturing partners.  On April 27th, 2009, the Company acquired Amanasu Water Corporation from its sister company Amanasu Environment Corporation and renamed it Amanasu Support Corporation. During the quarter ending March 31, 2013 The Company sold its 100% ownership of Amanasu Support Corporation, formerly named Amanasu Water Corporation (Water) to its parent company, Amanasu Corporation (Japan) for $10,000. Because the subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets transferred on the sale, the excess was transferred to paid-in capital.  History  The Company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business (see "Cautionary Statements" below). The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a high-powered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter. The technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with Amanasu Corporation, formerly Family Corporation. Amanasu Corporation, a Japanese company and the Company's largest shareholder, acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors. Amanasu Corporation subsequently transferred the right to the Company, and the Company succeeded to the exclusive, worldwide rights. Atsushi Maki, a director and officer of the Company, is the sole shareholder of Amanasu Corporation. At this time, the Company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies, constructing four proto-type motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter.  The market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive, thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully. To meet the economical sale price requirement the Company planned to conduct their manufacturing in China to reduce cost, and hoped it would meet the Company's expectations; however, significant difficulty with protecting the Company's proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged. In addition to proprietary issues, there were major concerns in customer service follow-ups (i.e. product warranty, maintenance, etc). The Company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in China, the result of safety related incidents, if not managed appropriately, would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the Company. To solve the two major issues, the Company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition. Evader Motorsports, Inc. ("Evader"), an electric motorcycle producer, entered into an International Distributor Agreement, whereby the Company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of Evader products. Evader, in turn, would manage customer-service concerns. The Company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in Japan, with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties. The Company also considered Evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters. The Company believed that with a combined effort using both companies' resources and technology, the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market.  Further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and Evader's scooters. The research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required. First the retail price of the Evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the Japanese market. The research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from China to Japan directly. The quality of their product is unclear; however, the retail price of the new company's product effectively competes in the Japanese market. The refinements needed to make the Evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time, thus the Company has decided to discontinue business relations with Evader, and abandon the electric scooter project; however, the Company still holds the related patents.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  History (continued)  In place of the electric scooter, other projects including a cooperative effort with Seems Inc., formerly introduced as Pixen Inc. and their breakthrough "Bio-scent technology" are in development. Seems Inc. is a Pioneer in the newly developed bio-scent technology industry. Bio-scent technology involves the application of "scent data transmission", a digitized form of scents, in various industries such as biotechnology, medical care, environment, security, etc in addition to common aroma therapy. Due to its revolutionary technologies, Seems has been able to become a multi-million dollar company in less than 6 years and is expected to become public. Its DAA (Defensive Aromatic Air) is its current flagship product.  In addition to being an air purifying system, Seems' DAA effectively removes up to 91% of air pollutants such as ammonia, and by products of cigarette smoke. It also provides odor neutralization, and air-borne anti-bacterial effects. Seems has also developed a scent-particle sensor, which is programmable to detect certain scent particles. This sensor is 1000 times more sensitive than even a dog's sense of smell. This scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection. All diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses. Seems' sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data.  With uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the FDA for various technologies by Seems Inc, the Company decided to begin a new project in the Food/Beverage industry, specifically Franchise management under the new leadership of Yukinori Yoshino, who was appointed President of the Company as of October 16th, 2007; however, due to personal reasons unrelated to the Company, Mr. Yoshino stepped down as President as of May 11, 2009, with the Chairman Mr. Atsushi Maki assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer.  PRODUCTS  Electric Motor Scooter  The Company initial intentions were to participate in the emerging electric vehicle market by using its licensed technologies to design, manufacture, and market lightweight, electric motor scooters. The Company planned to provide its own battery charging technology to Evader Motorcycle, Inc. to develop an improved electric scooter aiming at the Japan and Southeast Asian markets; however, with recently marketing research, the Evader product was not able to meet the Company's pricing standards. The Company's electric scooter project will be on hold until more customer-service related resources can be attained.  Automated Human Waste Disposal Unit "Haruka"  This technology collects human waste of hospital, and other care facility patients on an individual basis through an automated system (patents pending). The non-invasive collection mechanism is fastened to patient, which in turn is connected to the collector itself. The part attached to the patient contains several cleaning mechanisms, which are activated automatically through the unit's controller. The collection unit can then be emptied by an attending care professional when the unit is full. The Company believes that the hospital, and related care industries will greatly benefit from this form of technology. With an automated system, care professional will be able to more effectively allocate their time to more critical patient needs, while at the same time the patient is provided with more comfort. The Company plans to utilize government health care initiatives to reduce the cost the purchaser (varies by market), which the company believes is the cornerstone to the project that will in turn help revolutionize the care industry.  The Company believes that the Haruka is a Class I medical device, which has a much shorter approval process. The Company has tentative plans for production, however, cannot guarantee this production schedule.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  PLAN OF OPERATION  The Company is a development stage corporation. It has not commenced its planned operations of manufacturing and marketing. Its operations to date have been limited to conducting various tests on its technologies.  The Company will continue to develop and market two technologies which the Company believes have great market potential.  The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc., a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts.  The second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now currently seeking, manufacturing partners.  The Company will also be concentrating its efforts on capital raising efforts to enter into the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company satisfies all entry requirements, except for investment capital. The Company's target is to raise $30,000,000 in the near future. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the fund on an acceptable term or at all.  As stated above, the Company cannot predict whether or not it will be successful in its capital raising efforts and, thus, be able to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months. If the Company is unsuccessful in raising at least $165,000, it may not be able to complete its plan of expanding operations as discussed above.  The company is expecting to gain the capital from issuing and selling the shares of the Company.  Results of Operations  General and administrative expenses increased $25,060 to $27,563 for the three months September 30, 2016 as compared to $2,503 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of higher rent, consulting and professional fees.  General and administrative expenses decreased $6,372 to $54,384 for the nine months September 30, 2016 as compared to $60,756 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of lower professional and consulting fees.  As a result of the above, the Company incurred losses from operations of $27,563 and $54,384 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to losses from operations of $2,503 and $60,756 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense decreased $489 to $2,908 as compared to $3,397 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense increased $313 to $8,420 as compared to $8,107 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  As a result of the above, the Company incurred net losses of $30,471 and $62,804, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net losses of $5,900 and $68,863, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's minimum cash requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be $60,000, including rent, audit and professional fees. The Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to support its overhead for the next twelve months and there are no material commitments for capital at this time other than as described above. The Company will need to issue and sell shares to gain capital for operations or arrange for additional shareholder or related party loans. There is no current commitment for either of these fund sources.  Our working capital deficit increased $54,642 to $384,155 at September 30, 2016 as compared to $329,513 at December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in advances from shareholders and officers and accrued interest.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net decrease in cash of $8,246. The Company's principal sources and uses of funds were as follows:  Cash used in operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company used $34,383 in cash for operations as compared to $63,022 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily as a result of the lower operating loss.  Cash provided by investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities was $8,162 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $-0- for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due to a decrease in the amount due from affiliate.  Cash provided by financing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $17,975 as compared to $65,480 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of lower deposits for the purchase of common stock and loan from shareholders and officers.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANAGEMENTS  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.  Our critical accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2016 (the "Annual Report"). There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the 2015 consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  No recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  This Form 10Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 31, 2016 (the "Annual Report").  COMPANY OVERVIEW  Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 1, 1997 under the name of Avani Manufacturing (China) Inc. The Company changed its name to Genesis Water Technology on August 17, 1999, and to Supreme Group International, Inc. on December 24, 2000. On June 7, 2001, it changed its name to Amanasu Technologies Corporation. It changed its name again on December 21, 2007 to Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation. The Company is a development stage company, and has not conducted any operations or generated any revenue since its inception.  The Company's principal offices were relocated on April 1, 2010 from 115 East 57th Street 11th Floor New York, NY 10022, to 445 Park Avenue Center 10th floor New York, NY 10022 Telephone: 604-790-8799. The Tokyo branch has relocated from 3-7-11 Azabujuubann Minato-Ku Tokyo Japan to Suite 905, 1-6-1 Senzoku Taito-Ku Tokyo Japan. Telephone: 03-5808-3663.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  The Company has 2 technologies which the Company believes have great market potential. The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc., a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts. The second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology, extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now seeking, manufacturing partners.  On April 27th, 2009, the Company acquired Amanasu Water Corporation from its sister company Amanasu Environment Corporation and renamed it Amanasu Support Corporation. During the quarter ending March 31, 2013 The Company sold its 100% ownership of Amanasu Support Corporation, formerly named Amanasu Water Corporation (Water) to its parent company, Amanasu Corporation (Japan) for $10,000. Because the subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets transferred on the sale, the excess was transferred to paid-in capital.  History  The Company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business (see "Cautionary Statements" below). The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a high-powered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter. The technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with Amanasu Corporation, formerly Family Corporation. Amanasu Corporation, a Japanese company and the Company's largest shareholder, acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors. Amanasu Corporation subsequently transferred the right to the Company, and the Company succeeded to the exclusive, worldwide rights. Atsushi Maki, a director and officer of the Company, is the sole shareholder of Amanasu Corporation. At this time, the Company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies, constructing four proto-type motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter.  The market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive, thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully. To meet the economical sale price requirement the Company planned to conduct their manufacturing in China to reduce cost, and hoped it would meet the Company's expectations; however, significant difficulty with protecting the Company's proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged. In addition to proprietary issues, there were major concerns in customer service follow-ups (i.e. product warranty, maintenance, etc). The Company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in China, the result of safety related incidents, if not managed appropriately, would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the Company. To solve the two major issues, the Company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition. Evader Motorsports, Inc. ("Evader"), an electric motorcycle producer, entered into an International Distributor Agreement, whereby the Company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of Evader products. Evader, in turn, would manage customer-service concerns. The Company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in Japan, with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties. The Company also considered Evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters. The Company believed that with a combined effort using both companies' resources and technology, the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  History (continued)  Further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and Evader's scooters. The research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required. First the retail price of the Evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the Japanese market. The research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from China to Japan directly. The quality of their product is unclear; however, the retail price of the new company's product effectively competes in the Japanese market. The refinements needed to make the Evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time, thus the Company has decided to discontinue business relations with Evader, and abandon the electric scooter project; however, the Company still holds the related patents.  In place of the electric scooter, other projects including a cooperative effort with Seems Inc., formerly introduced as Pixen Inc. and their breakthrough "Bio-scent technology" are in development. Seems Inc. is a Pioneer in the newly developed bio-scent technology industry. Bio-scent technology involves the application of "scent data transmission", a digitized form of scents, in various industries such as biotechnology, medical care, environment, security, etc in addition to common aroma therapy. Due to its revolutionary technologies, Seems has been able to become a multi-million dollar company in less than 6 years and is expected to become public. Its DAA (Defensive Aromatic Air) is its current flagship product.  In addition to being an air purifying system, Seems' DAA effectively removes up to 91% of air pollutants such as ammonia, and by products of cigarette smoke. It also provides odor neutralization, and air-borne anti-bacterial effects. Seems has also developed a scent-particle sensor, which is programmable to detect certain scent particles. This sensor is 1000 times more sensitive than even a dog's sense of smell. This scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection. All diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses. Seems' sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data.  With uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the FDA for various technologies by Seems Inc, the Company decided to begin a new project in the Food/Beverage industry, specifically Franchise management under the new leadership of Yukinori Yoshino, who was appointed President of the Company as of October 16th, 2007; however, due to personal reasons unrelated to the Company, Mr. Yoshino stepped down as President as of May 11, 2009, with the Chairman Mr. Atsushi Maki assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer.  PRODUCTS  Electric Motor Scooter  The Company initial intentions were to participate in the emerging electric vehicle market by using its licensed technologies to design, manufacture, and market lightweight, electric motor scooters. The Company planned to provide its own battery charging technology to Evader Motorcycle, Inc. to develop an improved electric scooter aiming at the Japan and Southeast Asian markets; however, with recently marketing research, the Evader product was not able to meet the Company's pricing standards. The Company's electric scooter project will be on hold until more customer-service related resources can be attained.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  PRODUCTS (continued)  Automated Human Waste Disposal Unit "Haruka"  This technology collects human waste of hospital, and other care facility patients on an individual basis through an automated system (patents pending). The non-invasive collection mechanism is fastened to patient, which in turn is connected to the collector itself. The part attached to the patient contains several cleaning mechanisms, which are activated automatically through the unit's controller. The collection unit can then be emptied by an attending care professional when the unit is full. The Company believes that the hospital, and related care industries will greatly benefit from this form of technology. With an automated system, care professional will be able to more effectively allocate their time to more critical patient needs, while at the same time the patient is provided with more comfort. The Company plans to utilize government health care initiatives to reduce the cost the purchaser (varies by market), which the company believes is the cornerstone to the project that will in turn help revolutionize the care industry.  The Company believes that the Haruka is a Class I medical device, which has a much shorter approval process. The Company has tentative plans for production, however, cannot guarantee this production schedule.  PLAN OF OPERATION  The Company is a development stage corporation. It has not commenced its planned operations of manufacturing and marketing. Its operations to date have been limited to conducting various tests on its technologies.  The Company will continue to develop and market two technologies which the Company believes have great market potential.  The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc., a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts.  The second technology is an automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology extremely competitive even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now currently seeking, manufacturing partners.  The Company will also be concentrating its efforts on capital raising efforts to enter into the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company satisfies all entry requirements, except for investment capital. The Company's target is to raise $30,000,000 in the near future. There will be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise the fund on an acceptable term or at all.  As stated above, the Company cannot predict whether or not it will be successful in its capital raising efforts and, thus, be able to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months. If the Company is unsuccessful in raising at least $165,000, it may not be able to complete its plan of expanding operations as discussed above.  The company is expecting to gain the capital from issuing and selling the shares of the Company.  ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS  OF OPERATIONS (continued)  Results of Operations  General and administrative expenses decreased $6,563 (42.5%) and $31,432 (54.0%) to $8,867 and $26,821, respectively, for the three and six months June 30, 2016 as compared to $15,430 and $58,253 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 primarily as a result of lower professional fees.  As a result of the above, the Company incurred losses from operations of $8,867 and $26,821 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to losses from operations of $15,430 and $58,253 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  Interest expense increased modestly as a result of the increase in advances from shareholders and officers.  As a result of the above, the Company incurred net losses of $11,702 and $32,333, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to net losses of $17,805 and $62,963, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The Company's minimum cash requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be $60,000, including rent, audit and professional fees. The Company does not have sufficient cash on hand to support its overhead for the next twelve months and there are no material commitments for capital at this time other than as described above. The Company will need to issue and sell shares to gain capital for operations or arrange for additional shareholder or related party loans. There is no current commitment for either of these fund sources.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANAGEMENTS  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period.  Our critical accounting policies are described in the Notes to the Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 31, 2016 (the "Annual Report"). There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies are described in our notes to the 2015 consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  No recently issued accounting pronouncements had or are expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements.

	(Unaudited)



	 


	 


	 



	1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION



	 



	The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation ("the Company") as of March 31, 2013 and 2012 and for the three month periods ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods. The results of operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2013.



	 



	Certain information and disclosures normally included in the notes to financial statements have been condensed or omitted as permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the Company believes the disclosure is adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2012.



	 



	2. GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY



	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements, the Company had a material working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2013, and a record of continuing losses. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.



	 



	The Company's present plans, the realization of which cannot be assured, to overcome these difficulties include but are not limited to a continuing effort to investigate business acquisitions and joint ventures.



	 



	3. SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURES OF CASH FLOWS INFORMATION



	 



	There was no cash paid for interest or income taxes during either of the periods presented.



	 



	4. SALE OF SUBSIDIARY AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS



	 



	On February 7, 2012, the Company sold its interest in a subsidiary, Amanasu Support Corporation, to its parent for $10,000 cash.  This was a transaction between companies under common control.  For that reason, no gain or loss was recognized.  The subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets transferred; the excess was added to paid in capital.



	 



	The operations of the subsidiary are deemed discontinued and the statements of operations and cash flows distinguish between continuing and discontinued operations.

	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's Financial Statements, including the Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2012.







	COMPANY OVERVIEW







	Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 1, 1997 under the name of Avani Manufacturing (China) Inc. The Company changed its name to Genesis Water Technology on August 17, 1999, and to Supreme Group International, Inc. on December 24, 2000. On June 7, 2001, it changed its name to Amanasu Technologies Corporation. It changed its name again on December 21, 2007 to Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation.The Company is a development stage company, and has not conducted any operations or generated any revenue since its inception.







	The Company's principal offices were relocated on April 1, 2010 from 115 East 57th Street 11th Floor New York, NY 10022, to 445 Park Avenue Center 10th floor New York, NY 10022 Telephone: 212-836-4727 . The Tokyo branch has relocated from

	1-7-10 Motoakasaka Minato-Ku Tokyo Japan to 3-7-11 Azabujuubann Minato-Ku Tokyo Japan. Telephone: 03-3451-8870.








	Current







	As of April 27th, 2009, Amanasu Techno Holdings Corporation (herein after the "Company"), acquired Amanasu Water Corporation from its brother company Amanasu Environment Corporation and renamed it to Amanasu Support Corporation.







	The Company will continue to manufacture and market 2 technologies which the Company believes have great market potential.







	The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc, a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts.



	 



	The second technology is a automated personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly "Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort. The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology, extremely competative even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now currently seeking, manufacturing partners.

	History







	The Company is a development stage company and significant risks exist with respect to its business (see "Cautionary Statements" below). The Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high efficiency electrical motor and a high-powered magnet both of which are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter. The technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with Amanasu Corporation, formerly Family Corporation. Amanasu Corporation, a Japanese company and the Company's largest shareholder, acquired the rights to the technologies under a licensing agreement with the inventors. Amanasu Corporation subsequently transferred the right to Amanasu Technologies Corporation, and the Company succeeded to the exclusive, worldwide rights. Atsushi Maki, a director of the Company, is the sole shareholder of Amanasu Corporation. At this time, the Company is not engaged in the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies, constructing four proto-type motor scooters and various testing of the technologies and the motor scooter.




	The market place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive, thus offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale prices are prerequisites to compete successfully. To meet the economical sale price requirement the Company planned to conduct their manufacturing in China to reduce cost, and hoped it would meet the Company's expectations; however, significant difficulty with protecting the Company's proprietary technology unexpectedly emerged. In addition to proprietary issues, there were major concerns in customer service follow-ups (i.e. product warranty, maintenance, etc). The Company realized that with minimal control of the manufacturing standards in China, the result of safety related incidents, if not managed appropriately, would prove to be an overwhelming liability for the Company. To solve the two major issues, the Company decided to initiate a cooperative with a company that already produces completed electric scooters in a successful marketing condition. Evader Motersports, Inc. ("Evader"), an electric motorcycle producer, entered into an International Distributor Agreement, whereby the Company is appointed as an exclusive distributor of Evader products. Evader, in turn, would manage customer-service concerns. The Company was granted the exclusive rights for the motorcycle retail industry in Japan, with the right to include other marketing channels provided that it was agreed upon by both parties. The Company also considered Evader as a prospective company to share its technology with to create improved and more advanced electric scooters. The Company believed that with a combined effort using both companies' resources and technology, the resulting product would make a stronger impact on the market.







	Further marketing research was carried out comparing current electric scooters on the market and Evader's scooters. The research concluded that further refinement in several areas were required. First the retail price of the Evader scooters was too high to be competitive in the Japanese market. The research also found that a new company recently began importing electric scooters from China to Japan directly. The quality of their product is unclear; however, the retail price of the new company's product effectively competes in the Japanese market. The refinements needed to make the Evader scooters competitive economically would take too much time, thus the Company has decided to discontinue business relations with Evader, and abandon the electric scooter project; however, the Company still holds the related patents.







	In place of the electric scooter, other projects including a cooperative effort with Seems Inc., formerly introduced as PixenInc and their breakthrough "Bio-scent technology" are in development. Seems Inc. is a Pioneer in the newly developed bio-scent technology industry. Bio-scent technology involves the application of "scent data transmission", a digitized form of scents, in various industries such as biotechnology, medical care, environment, security, etc in addition to common aroma therapy. Due to its revolutionary technologies, Seems has been able to become a multi-million dollar company in less than 6 years and is expected to become public by early 2007. Its DAA (Defensive Aromatic Air) is its current flagship product.







	In addition to being an air purifying system, Seems' DAA effectively removes up to 91% of air pollutants such as ammonia, and by products of cigarette smoke. It also provides odor neutralization , and air-borne anti-bacterial effects. Seems has also developed a scent-particle sensor, which is programmable to detect certain scent particles. This sensor is 1000 times more sensitive than even a dogs sense of smell. This scent detection system can be applied in fields such cancer detection. All diseases carry a scent profile that is undetectable by the human senses. Seems's sensor is able to detect these scent profiles and display the digitized scent data.







	With uncertainty in the amount of time taken to obtain approval from the FDA for various technologies by Seems Inc, the Company decided to begin a new project in the Food/Beverage industry, specifically Franchise management under the new leadership of Yukinori Yoshino, who was appointed President of the Company as of October 16th, 2007; however, due to personal reasons unrelated to the Company, Mr. Yoshino stepped down as President as of May 11, 2009, with the Chairman Mr. Atsushi Maki assuming the position of Chief Executive Officer.

	PRODUCTS







	Electric Motor Scooter







	The Company initial intentions were to participate in the emerging electric vehicle market by using its licensed technologies to design, manufacture, and market lightweight, electric motor scooters. The Company planned to provide its own battery charging technology to Evader Motorcycle, Inc. to develop an improved electric scooter aiming at the Japan and Southeast Asian markets; however, with recently marketing research, the Evader product was not able to meet the Company's pricing standards. The Company's electric scooter project will be on hold until more customer-service related resources can be attained.







	Automated Human Waste Disposal Unit “Haruka”







	This technology collects human waste of hospital, and other care facility patients on an individual basis through an automated system (patents pending). The non-invasive collection mechanism is fastened to patient, which in turn is connected to the collector itself. The part attached to the patient contains several cleaning mechanisms, which are activated automatically through the unit's controller. The collection unit can then be emptied by an attending care professional when the unit is full.







	The Company believes that the hospital, and related care industries will greatly benefit from this form of technology. With an automated system, care professional will be able to more effectively allocate their time to more critical patient needs, while at the same time the patient is provided with more comfort. The Company plans to utilize government health care initiatives to reduce the cost the purchaser (varies by market), which the company believes is the cornerstone to the project that will in turn help revolutionize the care industry.







	The Company believes that the Haruka is a Class I medical device, which has a much shorter approval process. The Company has tentative plans for production during 2012, however, cannot guarantee this schedule.







	PLAN OF OPERATION







	The Company is a development stage corporation. It has not commenced its planned operations of manufacturing and marketing a lightweight electrical motor scooter. Its operations to date have been limited to conducting various tests on its technologies.







	The Company will continue to develop and market two technologies which the Company believes have great market potential.







	The first technology is a fast microbe detection system for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG Inc, a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial sales and marketing efforts.

The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the technology, extremely competative even in the current global economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing rights to the Haruka brand and is now currently seeking, manufacturing partners.

	The Company will also be concentrating its efforts on capital raising efforts to enter into the NASDAQ Global Market. The Company satisfies all entry requirements, except for investment capital. The Company's target is to raise $30,000,000 in the near future.







	As stated above, the Company can not predict whether or not it will be successful in its capital raising efforts, and, thus, be able to satisfy its cash requirements for the next 12 months. If the Company is unsuccessful in raising at least $300,000, it may not be able to complete its plan of operations as discussed above.







	The company is expecting to gain the capital from issuing and selling the shares of the Company.







	During the quarter ending March 31, 2012 The Company sold its 100% ownership of Amanasu Support Corporation, formerly named Amanasu Water Corporation (Water) to the parent company, Amanasu Corporation (Japan) for $10,000. Because the subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets transferred on the sale, the excess was transferred to paid in capital.







	FINANCIAL RESULTS







	Total Assets as at March 31, 2013 was $3,981 compared to $3,981 at December 31, 2012.







	Total current liabilities as at March 31, 2013 was $360,239 compared to $357,727 at December 31, 2012.







	Expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $6,845 compared to $954 for the same period of the prior year. The increase is primarily due to higher professional and filing fees.







	The net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $(2,512) compared with $(932) for the same period of the prior year. The higher loss is due to increases in administrative expense and interest expense.

NOTES TO
CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September
30, 2016

(Unaudited)

 

1. BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

 

In the
opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the
financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, and statements of cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These results are not
necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full
year.  The financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and consequently do
not include disclosures normally made in an Annual Report on Form
10-K.  The December 31, 2015 balance sheet included
herein was derived from the audited financial statements included
in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of that
date.  Accordingly, the financial statements included
herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) on March 31, 2016 (the “Annual
Report”).

 

2. GOING
CONCERN UNCERTAINTY

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the
financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficiency
of $384,155 and an accumulated deficit of $1,966,867 at September
30, 2016, and a record of continuing losses. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue in operation.

 

The
Company's present plans, the realization of which cannot be
assured, to overcome these difficulties include, but are not
limited to, a continuing effort to investigate business
acquisitions and joint ventures. As such, the Company may need to
pursue additional sources of financing. There can be no assurances
that the Company can secure additional financing.

 

3. RELATED
PARTY TRANSACTIONS

 

The Company
receives periodic advances from its principal stockholders and
officers based upon the Company’s cash flow needs. All
advances bear interest at 4.45%. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company borrowed $17,975. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, $255,875 and $237,900, respectively,
was due to the shareholders and officers, and accrued interest of
$48,555, and $40,134 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. Interest expense associated with these loans were
$2,908 and $8,420 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016, respectively as compared to $3,397 and $8,107 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. No terms
for repayment have been established. As a result, the amount is
classified as a current liability.

 

On
September 2, 2016, the Board of Directors approved a $20,000
consulting fee for the year 2016 to Lina Maki a shareholder of the
Company for her management consulting time in the past . The
Company has accrued the consulting fee of $20,000 as of September
30, 2016.

 

The Company
also leases it office space from a shareholder of the Company. At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts due to the
shareholder was. $3,751. For the most part, lease payments are made
by the Company’s affiliate. As such, such mounts are shown as
a reduction in the amount due from affiliate in the accompany
balance sheets.

 

4. INCOME
TAXES

 

Deferred
income taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences or
benefits to future years of any temporary differences between the
tax basis of assets and liabilities, and of net operating loss
carryforwards. The Company has experienced losses since its
inception. As a result, it has incurred no Federal income tax.
Under pronouncements of the FASB, recognition of deferred tax
assets is permitted unless it is more likely than not that the
assets will not be realized. The Company has recorded a 100%
valuation allowance against deferred taxes.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

 

The Company
evaluated subsequent events, which are events or transactions that
occurred after September 30, 2016 through the issuance of the
accompanying financial statements and determined that no
significant subsequent event need to be disclosed.

COMPANY
OVERVIEW

 

Amanasu
Techno Holdings Corporation ("Company") was incorporated in the
State of Nevada on December 1, 1997 under the name of Avani
Manufacturing (China) Inc. The Company changed its name to Genesis
Water Technology on August 17, 1999, and to Supreme Group
International, Inc. on December 24, 2000. On June 7, 2001, it
changed its name to Amanasu Technologies Corporation. It changed

ITEM 2.
MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

 

The Company
has 2 technologies which the Company believes have great market
potential. The first technology is a fast microbe detection system
for processed and unprocessed foods, called Biomonitec Glaze by NMG
Inc., a Japanese corporation. Traditional microbe level detection
systems take at least 24 hours to process; however, this mobile
system can process the same information in 15 minutes. The Company
is currently searching for investment partners to fund initial
sales and marketing efforts. The second technology is an automated
personal waste collection and cleaning machine Haruka (formerly
"Heartlet"), developed by Nanomax Corporation in Japan. The Haruka
is a machine used in retirement homes, hospitals, and even in
private residences. The Haruka allows the patient maximum comfort.
The Haruka lowers the burden on the caretaker with an automated
cleaning system. This machine is the only machine in its class to
have a 90% government rebate, which the company believes makes the
technology, extremely competitive even in the current global
economic crisis. The company obtained sales and manufacturing
rights to the Haruka brand and is now seeking, manufacturing
partners.

 

On April
27th, 2009, the Company acquired Amanasu Water Corporation from
its sister company Amanasu Environment Corporation and renamed
it Amanasu Support Corporation. During the quarter ending March 31,
2013 The Company sold its 100% ownership of Amanasu Support
Corporation, formerly named Amanasu Water Corporation (Water) to
its parent company, Amanasu Corporation (Japan) for $10,000.
Because the subsidiary had an excess of liabilities over the assets
transferred on the sale, the excess was transferred to paid-in
capital.

 

History

 

The Company
is a development stage company and significant risks exist with
respect to its business (see "Cautionary Statements" below). The
Company received the exclusive worldwide rights to a high
efficiency electrical motor and a high-powered magnet both of which
are used in connection with an electrical motor scooter. The
technologies were initially acquired under a license agreement with
Amanasu Corporation, formerly Family Corporation. Amanasu
Corporation, a Japanese company and the Company's largest
shareholder, acquired the rights to the technologies under a
licensing agreement with the inventors. Amanasu Corporation
subsequently transferred the right to the Company, and the Company
succeeded to the exclusive, worldwide rights. Atsushi Maki, a
director and officer of the Company, is the sole shareholder of
Amanasu Corporation. At this time, the Company is not engaged in
the commercial sale of any of its licensed technologies. Its
operations to date have been limited to acquiring the technologies,
constructing four proto-type motor scooters and various testing of
the technologies and the motor scooter.

 

The market
place for electric scooters has become intensely competitive, thus
offering rapid battery recharge time and more economical sale
prices are prerequisites to compete successfully. To meet the
economical sale price requirement the Company planned to conduct
their manufacturing in China to reduce cost, and hoped it would
meet the Company's expectations; however, significant difficulty
with protecting the Company's proprietary technology unexpectedly
emerged. In addition to proprietary issues, there were major
concerns in customer service follow-ups (i.e. product warranty,
maintenance, etc). The Company realized that with minimal control
of the manufacturing standards in China, the result of safety
related incidents, if not managed appropriately, would prove to be
an overwhelming liability for the Company. To solve the two major
issues, the Company decided to initiate a cooperative with a
company that already produces completed electric scooters in a
successful marketing condition. Evader Motorsports, Inc.
("Evader"), an electric motorcycle producer, entered into an
International Distributor Agreement, whereby the Company is
appointed as an exclusive distributor of Evader products. Evader,
in turn, would manage customer-ser

Copyright © 2017 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.Additional news source includes: Benzinga.comVideo content: WSJ Live videos © 2017 Dow Jones & Company Inc. www.wsj.com;  www.marketwatch.com.The Morningstar Rating for stocks identifies stocks trading at a discount or premium to their intrinsic value. Five-star stocks sell for the biggest risk-adjusted discount whereas one-star stocks trade at premiums to their intrinsic value. Based on a fundamentally focused methodology and a robust, standardized set of procedures and core valuation tools used by Morningstar's Equity Analysts, four key components drive the Morningstar Rating: 1. Assessment of the firm's economic moat, 2. Estimate of the stock's fair value, 3. Uncertainty around that fair value estimate and 4. Current market price.
