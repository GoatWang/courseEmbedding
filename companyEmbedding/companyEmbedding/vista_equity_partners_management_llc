    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Investment Profile 



Industry Focus



Collaborative Partnership







			Investment Profile		

Vista’s investment size has historically ranged from $20 million to $700+ million in equity capital. Our investment committee process for vetting transactions and continuous expansion of best practices enables us to offer value on larger transactions and funding below this range. Vista’s target investments are typically profitable, or nearly profitable, and are past the venture stage of their lifecycle. In most cases, we are the majority shareholder and only outside investor. This reduces the distractions commonly associated with having multiple financial investors and permits us to take a differentiated, long-term perspective. We are flexible and creative and pursue investments using a variety of transaction types.

Management and/or leveraged buyouts
Minority investments
Acquisition or growth financings
Recapitalizations or restructurings
Spinouts or divestitures
Take private transactions













				It’s easy not to focus on culture. It’s easy not to focus on people. And it’s easy not to focus on developing and training. But Vista does all of that and more.
				





				–Kim Eaton, CEO, Aptean
			







Industry Focus
Vista has focused on the software industry since our founding. We look for opportunities to build and grow sustainable, successful businesses in our target markets. Vista seeks companies that research and develop proprietary software solutions and either license them to their customers or leverage them internally to create a technology-enabled service. This includes companies that develop and market software, software as a service, and technology-enabled business, and information services. We believe there are various elements to the software business model that can create a differentiated, scalable, and highly profitable business. Identifying specific companies that can be transformed through the implementation of operational best practices and turned into predictable, high cash flow businesses is key to Vista’s target selection. While our portfolio companies need not fit a specific profile, many of our prospective investments have some common characteristics.

Existing or potential recurring revenue
Mission critical, “sticky” solutions

Collaborative Partnership
Vista provides strategic and operationally-focused investment with the goal of adding meaningful, sustainable value to each company within our portfolio. In addition to investment capital, we offer our portfolio companies access to proprietary best practices and an extensive relationship network. What sets us apart is our philosophy of working closely with management teams at the outset of each investment to reach a common understanding of business goals, develop the appropriate performance benchmarks, and implement proven best practices. Together, we aim to build some of the very best companies leading the technology sector today. Vista provides a tailored approach for adding value for each of our companies; we provide strategic, operational, and financial expertise.
