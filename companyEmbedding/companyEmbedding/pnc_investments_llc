Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)

Do More for Your Retirement With a Tax-advantaged IRA

IRA Selection Tool 






















It pays to invest in your future.

For a limited time, open a new qualifying PNC Investments account and you could get a cash bonus up to $1500.
Learn More


Special Offer









Why IRAs?






No matter how near or far off your retirement is, the tax advantages of an Individual Retirement Account can be too great to pass up. Using both an IRA and an employer-sponsored plan (such as a 401(k) if you have access to one) provides the opportunity to invest more for your retirement.










                        Traditional IRA
                    


                If you’ve earned income and are younger than age 70½, a Traditional IRA may be right for you.




Immediate tax advantages; contributions may be tax-deductible and earnings remain invested tax-deferred
Taxes are due at the time of distribution/withdrawal
No maximum income limits for eligibility


LEARN MORE





COMPARE IRAs












                        Roth IRA
                    


                If you’ve earned income below a certain threshold set by the IRS, a Roth IRA may be right for you.




Though contributions are made after-tax, earnings remain invested tax-free
Withdrawals are tax-free in retirement; there is no tax on qualified distributions after age 59½
May be more appropriate for those with growing income potential (who may be taxed at a lower rate now versus in retirement)


LEARN MORE





COMPARE IRAs












When Leaving an Employer




                If you're changing jobs or retiring, be sure to consider the assets you've accumulated in your employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k) plan.
            


There are four different actions you can take with assets invested via a previous employer’s retirement plan. These include leaving the assets where they are, moving the assets to a new employer’s plan, cashing out, and rolling the assets over to a Traditional or Roth Individual Retirement Account (IRA).
