We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events.

In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "could," "would," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "continue," or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described under "Risk Factors" in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as filed on July 29 2016.

Our phone number is +86-755-2218-4466.  Our business model was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our private label. Our source of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary products that we intended to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently, we have not yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date.  The Company is seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified.  Operating Expenses  During the quarters ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $9,520 and $14,239 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid to the Company's independent accounting firm associated with the SEC filings.  During the nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $34,260 and $32,828 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid to the Company's independent accounting firm associated with the SEC filings.  Going Concern  The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs related to:  ? filing of Exchange Act reports,  As of January 31, 2017, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $97,714. Management anticipates that fees associated with the filing of Exchange Act reports including accounting fees, legal fees and the payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000 during the next 12 months. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a "finder" to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds, would be desirable. If management can find a suitable target company, we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the investigation into the target company (including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000 to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.  -9-  [Table of Contents]  Currently, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management's plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  The Company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization.  The Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Our potential merger targets are firms seeking either the benefits of a business combination with an SEC reporting company and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. While a private operating company may achieve the same benefits by filing its own Exchange Act registration statement, such benefits can be achieved at a potentially faster rate with limited regulatory review through the completion of a business combination with a public reporting company. A potentially available business combination may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty.  In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. There are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the United States that have significant financial resources, that are seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of January 31, 2017, our total assets were $0 and our total liabilities were $73,514, comprised of notes payable to related parties.  Stockholders' equity decreased from $(39,254) as of April 30, 2016 to $(73,514) as of January 31, 2017.  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities were $(34,260) and $(32,356) respectively, consisting of net losses in both periods.  -10-  [Table of Contents]  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  We have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the Nine months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, net cash from financing activities was $34,260 and $32,359, respectively, consisting of loans from directors.  We suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $97,714 as of January 31, 2017, Currently, we are a non-operating public company. We currently are seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified. In the event we use all of our cash resources, certain members of management and shareholders have indicated their willingness to loan us funds at the prevailing market rate, assuming we find a suitable candidate for an acquisition, until such acquisition is consummated. Even though this is their current intention, they have made no firm commitment and it is at their sole discretion whether or not to fund us. In the event they do not fund us and we are not able to find outside investors, we will not have the funds necessary to operate and will have to dissolve.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

	ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES






	 


	Lvyuan Green Building
	Material Technology Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2013 as Green Supplements
	Online Inc. We changed our name to Lvyuan Green Building Material Technology Corp. on September 24, 2015. Our principal executive
	offices are located at Room 01, 25/F, Kerry Center, No. 2008 Renmin South Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong, People’s
	Republic of China. Our phone number is +86-755-2218-4466.


	 


	Our business model
	was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our private label. Our source
	of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary products
	that we intended to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently,
	we have not yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date.


	 


	At present, we have
	no employees other than our officers and directors, listed below.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	 


	 






	2.






	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 


	 




	 




	(a)






	Basis of Presentation






	 


	The accompanying
	unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance with U.S. GAAP
	and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly, they do
	not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP. The condensed statements of operations for the nine months
	ended January 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim period.
	These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included
	in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
	considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented have been reflected in such condensed
	financial statements.


	 


	The Company maintains
	its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The financial statements
	and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to U.S. GAAP and have been consistently
	applied in the presentation of financial statements. The accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity
	with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
	SEC.


	 




	 




	(b)






	Net loss per common share






	 


	The Company complies
	with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Net loss per common share is computed
	by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.
	At January 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be
	exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per common share
	is the same as basic loss per common share for the period.


	 




	 




	(c)






	Use of estimates






	 


	The preparation
	of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
	and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best
	information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.


	 




	 




	(d)






	Recently issued or adopted standards






	 


	The Company does
	not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results
	of operations, financial position or cash flow.

	INCOME TAXES






	 


	As of January 31,
	2017, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $97,714 that may be available to reduce future years’
	taxable income in varying amounts through 2033. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized
	in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded
	a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.




	 


	 


	 




	Due to the change
	in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $97,714 for Federal income
	tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating loss carry forwards
	may be limited as to use in future years.


	 






	4.






	GOING CONCERN AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	 


	The Company does
	not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs
	related to:


	 




	 



	●




	filing of Exchange Act reports,





	 



	●




	transfer agent services,





	 



	●




	payment of annual corporate fees, and





	 



	●




	investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.





	 


	As of January 31,
	2017, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $97,714. Management anticipates that fees associated with filing of Exchange Act
	reports including accounting fees and legal fees and payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000 within the next 12
	months. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of
	potential target businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including, but
	not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys and does not
	plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions, therefore,
	will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more
	funds, would be desirable. If the management can find a suitable target company, we will have to budget for additional fees relating
	to the investigation into the target company (including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the
	reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000 to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond such
	time will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since
	we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the
	Exchange Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.


	 






	5.






	LOANS FROM OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS






	 


	As of January 31,2017,
	the Company had received loans from its officers and directors aggregating $73,514. The loans are non-interest bearing and contain
	no specific repayment terms.

	Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.






	 


	This Quarterly Report
	on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and
	projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions
	about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any
	future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some
	cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,”
	“would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
	“continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such
	a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for the fiscal
	year ended April 30, 2016, as filed on July 29 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial
	Statements and related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.


	 



	Overview



	 


	Lvyuan Green Building
	Material Technology Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2013 as Green Supplements
	Online Inc. We changed to our present name on September 24, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located at Room 01, 25/F,
	Kerry Center, No. 2008 Renmin South Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen City, Guangdong, People’s Republic of China. Our phone
	number is +86-755-2218-4466.


	 


	Our business model
	was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our private label. Our source
	of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary products
	that we intended to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently,
	we have not yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date.


	 


	The Company is seeking
	to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction
	or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have not yet identified.



	 




	Operating Expenses




	 



	During the quarters
	ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $9,520 and $14,239 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid to the Company’s
	independent accounting firm associated with the SEC filings.


	 


	During the nine
	months ended January 31, 2017 and 2016, we have incurred $34,260 and $32,828 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid to
	the Company’s independent accounting firm associated with the SEC filings.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The Company does
	not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring costs
	related to:


	 




	 



	●




	filing of Exchange Act reports,  





	 



	●




	payment of annual corporate fees, and  





	 



	●




	investigating, analyzing and consummating an acquisition.





	  


	As of January 31,
	2017, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $97,714. Management anticipates that fees associated with the filing of Exchange
	Act reports including accounting fees, legal fees and the payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000 during the next
	12 months. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits
	of potential target businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources including,
	but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys and does
	not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions, therefore,
	will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which, if we had more

	to the investigation into the target company (including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the
	reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000 to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond will
	be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since we have
	minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the Exchange
	Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.

	Currently, our ability
	to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
	financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Our ability
	to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse
	merger with such company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger
	transaction and/or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.


	 


	The Company may
	consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion
	into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing
	financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve
	the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish
	a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting
	control which may occur in a public offering.


	 


	Any target business
	that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities
	without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business
	and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may affect a business
	combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to
	evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess
	all significant risks.


	 


	Our management anticipates
	that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of
	interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer
	a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization.


	 


	The Company anticipates
	that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Our potential merger targets are firms seeking
	either the benefits of a business combination with an SEC reporting company and/or the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly
	traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other things, facilitating
	or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the principals of and investors
	in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, and offering greater
	flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. While a private operating company
	may achieve the same benefits by filing its own Exchange Act registration statement, such benefits can be achieved at a potentially
	faster rate with limited regulatory review through the completion of a business combination with a public reporting company. A
	potentially available business combination may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of
	which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.
	The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business combination cannot presently
	be ascertained with any degree of certainty.


	 


	In identifying,
	evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective
	similar to ours. There are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the United States that have significant financial
	resources, that are seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan. Many of these entities are well established
	and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors
	possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted
	with those of many of these competitors.


	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of January 31,
	2017, our total assets were $0 and our total liabilities were $73,514, comprised of notes payable to related parties.


	 


	Stockholders’
	equity decreased from $(39,254) as of April 30, 2016 to $(73,514) as of January 31, 2017. 


	 



	Cash Flows from Operating Activities



	 


	We have not generated
	positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months ended January 31, 2017 and January 31, 2016, net cash flows
	used in operating activities were $(34,260) and $(32,356) respectively, consisting of net losses in both periods.

	[Table of Contents]











	 




	Cash Flows from Financing Activities



	 


	We have financed
	our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the Nine months ended January
	31, 2017 and 2016, net cash from financing activities was $34,260 and $32,359, respectively, consisting of loans from directors. 


	We suffered recurring
	losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $97,714 as of January 31, 2017, Currently, we are a non-operating public
	company. We currently are seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization,
	exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses or assets that we have
	not yet identified. In the event we use all of our cash resources, certain members of management and shareholders have indicated
	their willingness to loan us funds at the prevailing market rate, assuming we find a suitable candidate for an acquisition, until
	such acquisition is consummated. Even though this is their current intention, they have made no firm commitment and it is at their
	sole discretion whether or not to fund us. In the event they do not fund us and we are not able to find outside investors, we will
	not have the funds necessary to operate and will have to dissolve.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We have not entered
	into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
	resources and would be considered material to investors.

	Item 4.






	Controls and Procedures.






	 




	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
	and Procedures




	 


	Based on an evaluation
	of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act), as
	of January 31, 2017, the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal executive officer
	and principal financial and accounting officer) has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
	not effective at a reasonable assurance level.


	 




	Limitations on the Effectiveness
	of Controls




	 


	A control system,
	no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control
	system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
	that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure controls and procedures

	ORGANIZATION
	AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES







	 




	Lvyuan
	Green Building Material Technology Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2013
	as Green Supplements Online Inc. We changed our name to Lvyuan Green Building Material Technology Corp. on September 24, 2015.
	Our principal executive offices are located at Room 01, 25/F, Kerry Center, No. 2008 Renmin South Road, Luohu District, Shenzhen
	City, Guangdong, People’s Republic of China. Our phone number is +86-755-2218-4466.




	 




	Our
	business model was to buy nutrition and dietary products from different manufacturers and resell those products under our privatelabel.
	Our source of revenue from operations was to be reselling nutrition and dietary supply products. The line of nutrition and dietary
	products that we intended to market was to be standard non-proprietary supplements and other products that contained our label. Currently,
	we have not yet initiated any product development efforts nor generated any revenue to date.




	 




	On
	July 16, 2015, the Company’s then-controlling shareholder, Vyacheslav Sements (“VS”), and the other shareholders
	of the Company (collectively, the “Original Stockholders”) entered into a stock purchase agreement (the “Agreement”)
	to sell 97.5% of the Company’s common stock (the “Common Stock”) for $225,000 in cash (the “Consideration”)
	to a number of individuals (the “Current Stockholders”). The Consideration was paid to the Original Stockholders and
	the Common Stock was transferred to the Current Stockholders on August 3, 2015, which resulted in a change in control of the Company.




	 




	Following
	the change of control, the Company is now seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
	purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses
	or assets that we have not yet identified.




	 




	At
	present, we have no employees other than our officers and directors, listed below.

	NOTES
	TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	 







	2.






	SUMMARY
	OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	 






	 





	(a)






	Development
	Stage Company







	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United
	States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) related to development stage companies. A development-stage company is one in which
	planned principal operations have not commenced or, if its operations have commenced, there has been no significant revenues therefrom.




	 






	 





	(b)






	Basis
	of Presentation







	 




	The
	accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared from the books and records of the Company in accordance
	with U.S. GAAP and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Accordingly,
	they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP. The condensed statements of operations for the
	three months ended July 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future
	interim period. These unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
	notes thereto included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016. In the opinion of
	management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented have
	been reflected in such condensed financial statements.




	 




	The
	Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method of accounting for financial reporting purposes. The
	financial statements and notes are representations of management. Accounting policies adopted by the Company conform to U.S. GAAP
	and have been consistently applied in the presentation of financial statements. The accompanying financial statements are presented
	in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and pursuant to the
	rules and regulations of the SEC.




	 






	 





	(c)






	Net
	loss per common share







	 




	The
	Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC 260, “Earnings Per Share.” Net loss per common
	share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
	for the period. At July 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially,
	be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per common
	share is the same as basic loss per common share for the period.




	 






	 





	(d)






	Use
	of estimates







	 




	The
	preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
	affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using
	the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however actual results could differ materially from those estimates.




	 






	 





	(e)






	Recently
	issued or adopted standards







	 




	The
	Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s
	results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

	3.






	INCOME
	TAXES







	 




	As
	of July 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $80,538that may be available to reduce future
	years’ taxable income in varying amounts through 2033. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have
	not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the
	Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.




	 




	Due
	to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $80,538
	for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur net operating
	loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.




	 







	4.






	GOING
	CONCERN AND CAPITAL RESOURCES







	 




	The
	Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring
	costs related to:




	 






	 




	●




	filing
	of Exchange Act reports,






	 




	●




	transfer
	agent services,






	 




	●




	payment
	of annual corporate fees, and






	 




	●




	investigating,
	analyzing and consummating an acquisition.






	 




	As
	of July 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $80,538. Management anticipates that fees associated with filing
	of Exchange Act reports including accounting fees and legal fees and payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000
	within the next 12 months. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and
	analyze the merits of potential target businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting
	various sources including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds,
	consultants and attorneys and does not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business
	opportunity. Management decisions, therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis,
	market surveys and the like which, if we had more funds, would be desirable. If the management can find a suitable target
	company, we will have to budget for additional fees relating to the investigation into the target company (including due
	diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and consummating the reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000 to
	$150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with amounts that may be
	loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. Since we have minimal assets and will
	continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under the Exchange Act, we may cease
	business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.




	 







	5.






	LOANS
	FROM OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS







	 




	As
	of July 31, 2016, the Company had received loans from its officers and directors aggregating $48,480. The loans are non-interest
	bearing and contain no specific repayment terms.

	Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.







	 




	This
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current
	expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties
	and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
	from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.
	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as “may,” “should,” “could,”
	“would,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,”
	“continue,” or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to
	such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors” in our Form 10-K for the
	fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, as filed on July 29 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial
	Statements and related Notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.

	Lvyuan
	Green Building Material Technology Corp. (the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 10, 2013
	as Green Supplements Online Inc. We changed to our present name on September 24, 2015. Our principal executive offices are located

	the change of control, the Company is now seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock
	purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating businesses
	or assets that we have not yet identified.

	Operating
	Expenses






	 





	During
	the quarters ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, we have incurred $17,084 and $3,920 in expenses, respectively, including fees paid
	to the Company’s independent accounting firm associated with the SEC filings.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	The
	Company does not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. During the next 12 months we anticipate incurring
	costs related to:




	 






	 




	●




	filing
	of Exchange Act reports,






	 




	●




	payment
	of annual corporate fees, and






	 




	●




	investigating,
	analyzing and consummating an acquisition.






	 




	As
	of July 31, 2016, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $80,538. Management anticipates that fees associated with the filing
	of Exchange Act reports including accounting fees, legal fees and the payment of annual corporate fees will not exceed $60,000
	during the next 12 months. We do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze
	the merits of potential target businesses. Management intends to search for a business combination by contacting various sources
	including, but not limited to, our affiliates, lenders, investment banking firms, private equity funds, consultants and attorneys
	and does not plan to conduct a complete and exhaustive investigation and analysis of a business opportunity. Management decisions,
	therefore, will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys and the like which,
	if we had more funds, would be desirable. If management can find a suitable target company, we will have to budget for additional
	fees relating to the investigation into the target company (including due diligence and possibly visiting the facilities) and
	consummating the reverse merger, which may cost between $125,000 to $150,000. We expect that the expenses for the next 12 months
	and beyond will be paid with amounts that may be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.
	Since we have minimal assets and will continue to incur losses due to the expenses associated with being a reporting company under
	the Exchange Act, we may cease business operations if we do not timely consummate a business combination.




	 




	Currently,
	our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain
	the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due. Our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent upon our ability to find a suitable target company and enter
	into a possible reverse merger with such company. Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing
	through a reverse merger transaction and/or related party advances. However, there is no assurance of additional funding being
	available.




	 




	The
	Company may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for
	expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may
	be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination
	may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires
	to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense,
	and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.




	 




	Any
	target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth,
	including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent
	in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we
	may affect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management
	will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly
	ascertain or assess all significant risks.




	 




	Our
	management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
	and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s
	plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization.




	 




	The
	Company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Our potential merger targets
	are firms seeking either the benefits of a business combination with an SEC reporting company and/or the perceived benefits of
	becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other
	things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the
	principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees,
	and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock. While
	a private operating company may achieve the same benefits by filing its own Exchange Act registration statement, such benefits
	can be achieved at a potentially faster rate with limited regulatory review through the completion of a business combination with
	a public reporting company. A potentially available business combination may occur in many different industries and at various
	stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities
	extremely difficult and complex. The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete a business
	combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty.




	 







	 



	10



	 







	 





	 




	In
	identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business
	objective similar to ours. There are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the United States that have significant
	financial resources, that are seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan. Many of these entities are well
	established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many
	of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively
	limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.




	 





	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	As
	of July 31, 2016, our total assets were $0 and our total liabilities were $56,338, comprised of notes payable to related parties.




	 




	Stockholders’
	equity decreased from $(39,254) as of April 30, 2016 to $(56,338) as of July 31, 2016. 




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Operating Activities





	 




	We
	have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the three months ended July 31, 2016, net cash flows used
	in operating activities were $(9,226), consisting of a net loss.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities





	 




	We
	have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the three
	months ended July 31, 2016, net cash from financing activities was $3,700and $9,226, respectively, consisting of loans from directors. 



	 



	We
	suffered recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of $80,538 as of July 31, 2016. Currently, we are a
	non-operating public company. We currently are seeking to acquire, through a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition,
	stock purchase, reorganization, exchangeable share transaction or other similar business transaction with one or more operating
	businesses or assets that we have not yet identified. In the event we use all of our cash resources, certain members of management
	and shareholders have indicated their willingness to loan us funds at the prevailing market rate, assuming we find a suitable
	candidate for an acquisition, until such acquisition is consummated. Even though this is their current intention, they have made
	no firm commitment and it is at their sole discretion whether or not to fund us. In the event they do not fund us and we are not
	able to find outside investors, we will not have the funds necessary to operate and will have to dissolve.





	 






	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
	on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures
	or capital resources and would be considered material to investors.

	Evaluation
	of Disclosure Controls and Procedures






	 




	Based
	on an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
	Exchange Act), as of July 31, 2016, the Company’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (its principal
	executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer) has concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and
	procedures were not effective at a reasonable assurance level.




	 






	Limitations
	on the Effectiveness of Controls






	 




	A
	control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
	of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all controls systems, no evaluation of controls can provide
	absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected. Our disclosure
	controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving its objectives.




	 






	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting






	 




	There
	have not been any changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s
	fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
	internal control over financial reporting.
