                St. Patrick loves the heat and develops its best color and form in hot weather.  Its flowers open slowly to reveal satiny-yellow petals brushed in chartreuse-green during the warm weather and a more golden hue during cooler temperatures.  Abundant flowers last all season, showing amazing stamina—makes great cut flowers, too! Patent 9591.

Dainty
Feb  3, 2017  |  By Tammy 





I purchased 3 roses from Michigan Bulb. This is the only one that survived. The other two died within weeks of planting. This plant is still young, I just purchased it a year ago. It was very small however the growth rate was pretty rapid. The flowers are a pale yellow and they are somewhat small. This made a great addition to my rose garden!
