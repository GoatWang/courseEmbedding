Lidsky, President and CEO of Datalink Corporation (DTLK), Interviews with the Wall Street Transcript InterviewWall Street TranscriptFebruary 19, 2014ReblogShareTweetShare67 WALL STREET, New York - February 19, 2014 - The Wall Street Transcript has just published its Data Hosting Centers and Data Storage Report offering a timely review of the sector to serious investors and industry executives. This special feature contains expert industry commentary through in-depth interviews with public company CEOs, Equity Analysts and Money Managers. The full issue is available by calling (212) 952-7433 or via The Wall Street Transcript Online.Topics covered: Data Hosting Centers - Flash Memory - Cloud Computing Secular Trends - Data Center REITS - Colocation, Managed Hosting and Cloud Computing - International Enterprise and Consumer Demand - Mobile Computing - Infrastructure Upgrades and Consolidation ActivityCompanies include: Datalink Corp. (DTLK) and many others.In the following excerpt from the Data Hosting Centers and Data Storage Report, the CEO of Datalink discusses the outlook for his company for investors:TWST: Let's start by introducing Datalink to our readers with a bit of company history and a snapshot of your business and operations today.Mr. Lidsky: Datalink is a $600 million public company, trades on the Nasdaq under DTLK. We are a data center solutions integrator, which means that we design data center infrastructure, hardware, software, for corporate customers. This includes all of the architecture and design work. We source all of the infrastructure. We install and deploy all that infrastructure; we provide customer support, managed services and ongoing consulting.Our customer set are enterprises in the United States that own their own data centers, so we're helping them to build and operate their data centers. This is different than, obviously, the Googles (GOOG) and Amazons (AMZN) and all the different colocation companies. These are companies that actually own and operate their own data centers. We primarily focus on the Fortune 1000, Fortune 2000, all headquartered in the United States. We are very much a vendor-independent company. We have a portfolio of products that we bring to bear to solve data center challenges, but on any given day, we will recommend a different manufacturer's product based on the specific needs of the customer. That's built into our value proposition to our customers. We have 32 offices coast to coast and about 500 employees.TWST: Are there any particular industry verticals among your customers where you're seeing the most demand or growth?Mr. Lidsky: We participate in all of the verticals except for federal. We do not have a federal practice by design., But among the other verticals, the strongest vertical we have is health care which accounts for approximately 20% of our business, but they're all relatively healthy for us.TWST: What trends are you seeing in terms of IT spending in general?For more of this interview and many others visit the Wall Street Transcript - a unique service for investors and industry researchers - providing fresh commentary and insight through verbatim interviews with CEOs, portfolio managers and research analysts.
