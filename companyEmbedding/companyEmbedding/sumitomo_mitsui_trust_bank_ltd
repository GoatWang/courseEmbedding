Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial solutions and financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage and real estate services.[3]
Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (三井住友トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Torasuto Hōrudingusu Kabushiki Gaisha), formerly Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., is a Japanese financial holding company headquartered in Chiyoda, Tokyo. It provides an assortment of financial solutions and financial products to retail and wholesale customers, with a focus on asset management, financial brokerage and real estate services.[3]
Its main operating company is Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited (三井住友信託銀行株式会社, Mitsui Sumitomo Shintaku Ginkō Kabushiki Gaisha), which is the largest trust company and the fifth-largest bank in Japan measured by assets.
The company has no capital relationship with the Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group; the two banking groups are similarly named because both are descended from the historical Sumitomo and Mitsui conglomerates.

History[edit]
Chuo Mitsui[edit]
SMT's earliest predecessor was The Mitsui Trust Company, Limited, established in March 1924 with capital of 30 million yen. In March 1948, it changed its name to The Tokyo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. It changed its name again to The Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited in 1952.[4]
The Chuo Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. was established in May 1962 with capital of 2.5 billion yen and support from Tokai Bank, Dai-Ichi Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. It took over Tokai and Dai-Ichi's trust businesses as well as the stock transfer agency business of Japan Securities Agents, Ltd. It acquired the Honshu operations of Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in 1998.[4]
Mitsui Trust and Chuo Trust signed a merger agreement in May 1999 and completed their merger in April 2000, becoming The Chuo Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Limited (中央三井信託銀行株式会社). In 2001, Chuo Mitsui announced its plans to establish a new bank holding company known as Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., which was formed in February 2002. It changed its name to Chuo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc. (中央三井トラスト・ホールディングス株式会社) in 2007.[4]
Sumitomo Trust[edit]
Sumitomo Trust Co., Ltd. was founded in July 1925 with capital of 20 million yen and its headquarters in Awajicho, Osaka. It changed its name to Fuji Trust & Banking Co., Ltd. in 1948 and adopted the name The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. (住友信託銀行株式会社) in 1952. In 1962 it moved its headquarters to the Sumitomo Building in Kitahama, Osaka.[5]
Merger[edit]
Chuo Mitsui agreed to merge with The Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co., Ltd. in November 2009, and formed a holding company, Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, Inc., by a share exchange between Chuo Mitsui and Sumitomo Trust in April 2011. The three main trust banks under this holding company merged in April 2012 to form Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank, Limited.[4] SMTB became the largest trust bank in Japan and the fifth-largest commercial bank overall measured by assets.[6]
SMTB was fined for insider trading in 2012, after a Chuo Mitsui fund manager was found to have traded on information leaked from Nomura Securities regarding a 2010 share issuance by Mizuho Financial Group.[7]

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
