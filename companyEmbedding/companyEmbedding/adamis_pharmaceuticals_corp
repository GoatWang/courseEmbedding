Phase 2: Clinical trials are conducted with a larger group of patients to evaluate effectiveness of an investigational drug for a defined patient population, and to determine common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug.
Phase 3: Clinical trials involve large scale, multi-center, comparative trials that are conducted with patients affected with a target disease to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the investigational drug and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Lower-cost alternative to EpiPen OK’d by FDA

TRENTON, N.J. -- U.S. regulators have approved new competition for EpiPen, the emergency allergy medicine that made Mylan a poster child for pharmaceutical company greed.The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp.'s product, which should go on sale later this year.Symjepi is a syringe prefilled with the hormone epinephrine, which helps stop life-threatening allergic reactions from insect stings and bites, foods such as nuts and eggs, or certain medications.San Diego-based Adamis says its product is easier to use than Mylan's EpiPen, a spring-loaded syringe filled with a set dose that comes with a training device.Symjepi also is smaller than EpiPen, so it's easier to fit in a pocket or purse. Most children and adults with severe food or insect allergies carry a device wherever they go and leave a spare at home, school or work.Adamis said it is still lining up a distributor so it hasn't set the exact price for its product, which will be sold in pairs, like EpiPen.Adamis spokesman Mark Flather said Symjepi is intended to be a "low-cost alternative" to EpiPen and similar products, and the company is aiming to sell it for less than generic EpiPens.In a note to investors, Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat wrote that Symjepi is not identical to EpiPen and so the price Adamis sets "will obviously be an important consideration."Currently, EpiPens cost about $630 to $700 without insurance, while the new generic version retails for about $225 to $425.Mylan, which has U.S. headquarters near Pittsburgh, launched generic EpiPens last December in an effort to deflect mounting criticism.Last summer, the company came under fire for repeatedly raising the price of EpiPens, and CEO Heather Bresch was grilled by a Congressional panel.Mylan hiked the price of a pair of EpiPens from $94 in 2007, when the company acquired the product, to $608 last year. The devices need to be replaced each year, adding to the financial sting.Analysts and others have estimated that it costs less than $20 to produce a pair of EpiPens.While EpiPen has other rival products, doctors tend to prescribe EpiPen because it's so well known.Just three years ago, EpiPens accounted for nearly 90 percent of both revenue and prescriptions filled in the U.S. for epinephrine injectors and syringes, according to QuintilesIMS, a pharmaceutical analytics company.In the first quarter of this year, brand-name EpiPens only drew about 60 percent of epinephrine device prescriptions, while generic EpiPens - mostly Mylan's - had captured 38 percent of prescriptions.Dr. Dennis J. Carlo, CEO of Adamis, said in a statement that his company is preparing to apply for FDA approval of a "junior version" of Symjepi. That would contain a lower epinephrine dose than Symjepi, and would compete with Mylan's EpiPen Jr.Adamis, which specializes in developing medicines for respiratory disease and allergies, saw its shares surge more than 55 percent late Thursday, to $6.05.

  Home  Biotech Stocks  Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ:ADMP) Ready To Disrupt Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) EpiPen Reign     Biotech Stocks  Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ:ADMP) Ready To Disrupt Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) EpiPen Reign  ByAndy Parker -June 20, 2017 438  Share on Facebook
Tweet on Twitter


 The Mylan N.V. (NASDAQ:MYL) EpiPen reign may be about to come to an end, the Food and Drug Administration having approved an affordable alternative.  Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp (NASDAQ:ADMP) generic version, Symjepi, is the latest addition in the highly competitive space.
The fact that Adami’s product will be much cheaper means Mylan will struggle to ship as many products as it did in the past. The launch could not have come at a worse time for the pharmaceutical company which has seen its market share trimmed with the launch of alternatives from the likes of Kaleo Auvi.
Mylan has been the subject of immense criticism over the price it charges for its EpiPen products. Outrage from the public has already attracted the attention of legislators who asked the company to justify why it charges consumers up to $600 for its products.  The company was later fined $465 million for wrongly classifying its EpiPen under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
 Price Wars 
Pricing wars should be a point of concern for Mylan given the reaction that Adamis got on announcing the approval of Symjepi by the FDA.
“Pricing is on everyone’s mind as it should be given all of the pricing controversies around EpiPen. Pricing for Symjepi hasn’t been determined yet as that will be set around the time of the launch. […] Adamis does intend to position this product as the low-cost alternative to the other offerings in this market,” said Adamis Spokesperson.
 Symjepi’s cost advantage is not the only thing that Mylan will have to worry about.  The new prefilled syringe is not an auto-injector; taking its ease of use to another level.  The fact that some doctors struggle to use auto-injectors helps bolster the case of why Symjepi could be an attractive prospect for the mass market.
 Adami’s product is also highly portable at four inches long, something that observers believe will give it a competitive edge against the other alternatives.  Mylan might have to rethink its EpiPen Strategy if it is to generate any sales going forward.
Mylan stock was up by 1.39% in Monday’s trading session ending the day at $37.23 a share.

Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp. (ADMP-NASDAQ)
Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp. ("Adamis" or "the Company") is an emerging biopharmaceutical company combining specialty pharmaceuticals and biotechnology to create treatment options in the areas of allergy, respiratory, oncology, and immunological disorders as well as for infectious diseases. Adamis' initiatives include a prefilled single-dose epinephrine syringe for injection ("PFS") for which the Company is submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) in the U.S. The epinephrine PFS is used for the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and may have competitive advantages over existing epinephrine products due to its low cost and user friendliness. In addition, Adamis is developing inhaled therapeutics for allergic rhinitis, asthma, and COPD under a December 2010 agreement with Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd., a Bangladesh conglomerate with over 400 products ranging from allergy to oncology. In April 2011, Adamis' biotechnology unit completed the acquisition of a novel technology forming the basis for a prostate cancer vaccine called TeloB-VAX. TeloB-VAX is scheduled to enter Phase II studies, for which an Investigational New Drug (IND) application will likely be filed in the fourth quarter 2011. Going forward, the vaccine platform may be able to treat other tumor types, such as lung, breast, and colon cancers, as well as viral diseases, including chronic hepatitis, human papilloma virus (HPV), and influenza. Adamis is also advancing three first-in-class compounds (APC-100, -200, -300) to treat prostate cancer. Two of these have previously received the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) RAPID Award given to promising new cancer drugs. A Phase I/IIa study of APC-100 has already begun, and Adamis expects to submit an IND to begin studies with APC-200 in the first quarter 2012. In addition, through Adamis' reverse merger, it obtained a contraceptive product (C31G) that has completed a successful Phase III study and was shown to have met primary and secondary endpoints.

Adamis Pharmaceuticals: The CRL Post-Mortem - Adamis Pharmaceuticals Corp. (NASDAQ:ADMP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Adamis Pharmaceuticals: The CRL Post-MortemJun. 7.16 | About: Adamis Pharmaceuticals (ADMP) Alexander Maxwell Value, Growth, long-term horizon, biotechAMax Stock IdeasSummaryDelay gives time for competition to catch up to Adamis.Recent CRL should shake investor confidence in management.CRL is good news for Mylan, who has the only Epinephrine product on the market.

 Adamis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:ADMP) shareholders received negative news yesterday when the FDA announced that it issued a CRL for Adamis' Epinephrine pre-filled syringe. This decision was unexpected, as I was projecting that Adamis would obtain an FDA approval, instead of being rejected. For Adamis shareholders, this decision by the FDA could have a large impact on Adamis' ability to compete against other epinephrine products, and the decision left only one clear winner, Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL). CRL The FDA was concerned about some of the improvements that Adamis made to the device, which was in response to some initial concerns from the FDA. Essentially, the FDA is saying that Adamis will need to expand its human factors study and reliability study, in order to examine if the changes had any effect on usability. On a positive note, the FDA indicated that Adamis did solve the volume delivery issue, which was the subject of an initial CRL from the FDA. Timeline Adamis investors should be encouraged, as the company stated that it should be able to have its study expanded and results within a short amount of time, and at an immaterial cost. The real question though will be how long a short amount of time is. Every delay for Adamis is time for its competitor Antares (NASDAQ:ATRS), which is developing its own Epinephrine product with Teva (NYSE:TEVA) to catch up. As I mentioned in a previous article, the first Epinephrine product to the market will have a substantial advantage versus Mylan by being able to barely undercut them in price and gain significant marketshare. Having multiple competing products, however, will cause large pricing pressure and make the product less profitable. Even with a large partner that Adamis has in its partner Allergan (NYSE:AGN), the pricing pressure is still likely to be the case. It is also unclear as to the timeline for once Adamis submits a response, as to how the FDA will classify the response and whether there is any chance for the FDA to render an approval decision. It will be important for Adamis to have a response as quickly as possible, but to also get it right this time. Adamis has experienced too many delays with this product and investors are understandably frustrated about the fact that management has not been able to deliver. The longer that a generic epinephrine product is able to stay off the market, the more lucrative it is for Mylan (MYL), which currently has the EpiPen. Investors will need to see a quick response from Adamis and will need to rebuild confidence in management after an inability to execute up to this point.
 Concerns Moving Forward Without an approved product from the FDA, investors should have concerns about all of Adamis' pipeline. While Adamis does appear to have a solid pipeline of promising products (most of which are using the 505(b)(2) pathway), the ability of management to get caught up on relatively minor problems should be a concern. With Adamis trying to enter already heavily crowded marketplaces, it will need to continue to rely upon its ability to attract partners to market its products. With a management history of delays, partners could wait until much later in the approval process or until Adamis has approval in hand before partnering. Another concern is that the value of the pipeline could be adversely affected by a history of management's inability to see a product through to the finish line. This is the second CRL for Adamis, and while management may have history from other companies about being able to execute, the market will have a short memory for management. It is important that management continues to try to restore investor confidence after this setback. Conclusion Moving forward, investors should make sure that there is a very clear timeline for an FDA response. Investors will also need to watch the progress by competitors in order to make sure that Adamis is the first company to the market with a generic Epinephrine product. Any further delays could give the competition time to surpass Adamis. It is also concerning that the management at Adamis has now had two delays in getting the product approved. It will be important for management to rebuild confidence.
