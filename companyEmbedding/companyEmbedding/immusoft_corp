isp™ technology




The therapeutic objective enabled by Immune System Programming (ISP™) technology is to produce long-lived plasma cells from a patient’s B cells that replace missing or defective enzymes/proteins to cure serious disease.
The figure below shows the steps involved in using an ISP™-based therapeutic regimen:



Steps

The initial step involves collecting a patient’s B cells from a simple blood draw using a well established laboratory.
Once isolated, the patient’s B-cells are electroporated with DNA containing that encodes for a missing/defective protein responsible for the disease condition. The therapeutic gene is inserted into the patient’s cell(s) as a large plasmid, which includes the SB transposon system – the molecular machinery to integrate the gene into the cellular DNA.
Selected ISP™ modified B cells are expanded ex vivo in our proprietary lymphophesis culture systems.
The cell population is subsequently induced ex vivo in the culture system to differentiate into plasmablasts and plasma cells – termed ISP™ cells. The culture system yields a large population of ISP™ cells instructed to produce the desired therapeutic protein.
Long-lived plasma cells provide a lifetime of immunity against pathogens, and have robust protein production capabilities. This cell type naturally homes to survival niches in the bone marrow where they become long-lived, and actively secrete protein for extended periods.


Bellicum Pharmaceuticals have developed the iCasp9™ suicide gene system that can be added to ISP™ cells allowing for rapid in vivo elimination if the cell therapy should no longer be needed or desired.




Immusoft’s ISP technology offers several advantages over viral gene delivery approaches.

The DNA plasmid construct can be readily optimized to contain the correct gene payload and produced in large quantities that are sufficient for therapeutic use. Viral transfection methods are not as efficient and require large quantities of purified virus which can be difficult to produce.
In contrast to viral injections, ISP treatments are not subject to immune clearance, thus repeat ‘dosing’ can be contemplated.
The proprietary ISP transposon-based gene delivery platform can be readily adapted to express any therapeutic protein and used directly to modify a patient’s B-cells via standard cell transfection methods like electroporation. There is no need to optimize a viral gene delivery vehicle though pseudotyping or other methodology to enhance its efficiency of infecting key cell types.
Immusoft has conducted several proof-of-concept studies of the ISP system. In one of these studies, in collaboration with Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, B cells were isolated from the blood of a healthy human donor and successfully modified to produce the desired proteins – in this case, antibodies against HIV.

Immusoft’s ISP™ platform has disruptive potential in several therapeutic areas including enzyme/protein replacement, infectious disease, regenerative medicine, and cardiovascular disease. Immusoft seeks to enter collaborations or partnerships to develop treatment in key indications including hemophilia, sarcopenia (muscle loss), and atherosclerosis.


Indications



MPS Type I (Hurler’s Syndrome)

MPS Type I – Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I), is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase (IDUA), an enzyme responsible for the degradation of GAGs in lysosomes.[i] Without this enzyme, a buildup of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate occurs in the body, precipitating a cascade of debilitating abnormalities.[ii]
MPS I is delineated into three disease phenotypes based on clinical presentation: MPS I-H (Hurler syndrome, severe phenotype), MPS I-H/S (Hurler-Scheie syndrome, intermediate phenotype) and MPS I-S (Scheie syndrome, attenuated phenotype).[iii]
The more severe Hurler phenotype is characterized by impaired cognitive development, progressive coarsening of facial features, hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory failure, cardiac valvulopathy, recurrent otitis media, corneal clouding, musculoskeletal manifestations such as joint stiffness and contractures, and dysostosis multiplex. The symptoms arise after birth and progress rapidly. Most of the patients with Hurler Syndrome phenotype who are not submitted to a specific treatment, progress to death, on average, before the age of 10 years, and is due to complications related to brain damage or cardiorespiratory problems.[iv]
MPS I is a great technical fit for ISP™ because enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) only partially addresses patient needs by slowing the progression of the disease. HSCTs have a relatively high risk of rejection or in the case of ex vivo transduced HSCTs, dangerous downstream differentiation effects, and direct inject gene therapy approaches have either been unsuccessful or thought to be too risky from a regulatory perspective.  MPS I requires treatment for life.  ISP™ based treatments are
expected to result in a population of long-lived plasma cells, taking up survival niches in bone marrow, resulting in long-term enzyme production.
From a regulatory perspective, ISP™ therapy strikes a balance between the benefits of a HSCT, and risk profile of ERT.Despite the risks of HSCT mentioned above, HSCT has the ability to halt progression of the neurological deficit, and prevent premature death due to heart or liver disease. Even when performed early, HSCT will not correct musculoskeletal abnormalities, and the engrafted cells won’t last indefinitely.  An ISP™-based treatment for MPS I is less risky because it uses the patient’s own cells, doesn’t require myeloablative chemotherapy,and can be turned off once administered.  Production of IDUA enzyme from ISP™-modified cells is consistent and more natural than ERT.
Immusoft is currently filing regulatory documentation to support a Phase Ia/Ib clinical trial to treat MPS I with an ISP™ cell therapy product.

Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency)

Hemophilia A and hemophilia B are X-linked, genetic disorders that are caused by defective or deficient coagulation factor VIII and IX, respectively, resulting in the inability to form blood clots and sustained bleeding after trauma or injury. Recombinant clotting factor protein is currently used to treat hemophilia at a high cost per patient.  As a therapeutic approach for hemophilia, gene transfer has the potential to provide more consistent levels of circulating clotting factor over an extended period of time for more cost-effective treatment.  Moreover, only modest levels of FVIII or FIX expression (2%-5% of normal) can improve clinical outcomes. We are using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system to engineer autologous human B cells for secretion of clotting factors as a cellular therapy for hemophilia.  An in vitro system for expansion and differentiation of memory B cells
into plasma cells has been developed.  Plasma cells are suitable for sustained delivery of FVIII or FIX, since they secrete high levels of protein and may survive for years in vivo.  For human FIX expression, we assembled an SB transposon with the human FIX coding sequence (codon-optimized with R338L mutation for enhanced potency) regulated by the CAGS promoter.  Elevated levels of hFIX in cultures of B lymphoblastoid cells required co-electroporation of the hFIX transposon along with an SB transposase encoding plasmid, demonstrating the role of transposition in achieving extended hFIX expression.
There have been remarkable advances recently in the treatment of hemophilia B by systemic AAV8-hFIX administration, but similar treatment of hemophilia A presents a significant challenge due to the size of the FVIII-encoding sequence and the complexity of the protein. We previously demonstrated B-domain deleted hFVIII expression and correction of clotting dysfunction in FVIII deficient mice by hydrodynamic delivery using the SB transposon system (Ohlfest et al, Blood 105: 2691, 2005). Current studies are focused on identifying conditions for effective hFVIII transposon delivery and long term expression in primary human B cells after Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposition. Results from these studies will be applicable to the development of a clinical protocol for treatment of human hemophilia by infusion of B cells genetically engineered using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system.

Recessive Dystrophic Epidermyolysis Bullosa (RDEB)

Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into three major types. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly and they are caused by mutations in the same gene. The autosomal recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) result from mutations in both copies of the COL7A1 gene in each cell.
Individuals with moderate and severe forms may have many complications and require psychological support along with attention to the care and protection of the skin and soft tissues. When blisters appear, the objectives of care are to reduce pain or discomfort, prevent excessive loss of body fluid, promote healing, and prevent infection. The doctor may prescribe a mild analgesic to prevent discomfort during changes of dressings (bandages).
Systemic delivery of collagen VII expressing ISP™ cells for the RDEB patient population offers some major advantages over other forms of therapy.  Recent data suggests that intravenously administered C7 could simultaneously migrate to the Dermal-Epidermal Junction (DEJ) throughout the RDEB patient’s skin, reverse the “subclinical”, microscopic epidermal-dermal separation and prophylactically prevent frank skin blisters and erosions from forming. We believe that protein therapy via intravenous C7 may be a valid therapeutic strategy for patients with RDEB who currently have few therapeutic options. [i]

Sarcopenia (Muscle Loss with Aging)

One of the most distinctive characteristics of older people is the presence of skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. The term sarcopenia was used for the first time by Rosenberg to refer to the loss of lean body mass with aging. The prevalence of sarcopenia in the older population may range from 4% to 27% depending on the gender of the participants and country.
Immusoft has identified a suitable molecular candidate delivered by ISP™ cells to reverse the effects of age-related sarcopenia.



HIV

There exists a growing interest in interventions that either fully eradicate all replication-competent HIV (a “sterilizing” cure) or efforts that result in sustained control of persistent virus (often referred to
as a “functional cure”). Our overall vision is to target the viral reservoir using gene-modified autologous plasmablasts , which secrete a known broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from elite HIV suppressors. These antibodies will (1) enable the clearance of rare reservoir cells that spontaneously reactivate (during ART) leading to a gradual but eventually profound decrease in reservoir size and (2) prevent replication of any residual virus after ART is discontinued.
Immusoft has identified several broadly neutralizing antibodies to be delivered using an ISP™ cell therapy as a cell-based treatment option to prevent or even eradicate an HIV infection.



Atherosclerosis

Immusoft has identified a suitable molecular candidate delivered by ISP™ cells as an advanced treatment option for moderate to severe atherosclerosis.

into plasma cells has been developed.  Plasma cells are suitable for sustained delivery of FVIII or FIX, since they secrete high levels of protein and may survive for years in vivo.  For human FIX expression, we assembled an SB transposon with the human FIX coding sequence (codon-optimized with R338L mutation for enhanced potency) regulated by the CAGS promoter.  Elevated levels of hFIX in cultures of B lymphoblastoid cells required co-electroporation of the hFIX transposon along with an SB transposase encoding plasmid, demonstrating the role of transposition in achieving extended hFIX expression.
There have been remarkable advances recently in the treatment of hemophilia B by systemic AAV8-hFIX administration, but similar treatment of hemophilia A presents a significant challenge due to the size of the FVIII-encoding sequence and the complexity of the protein. We previously demonstrated B-domain deleted hFVIII expression and correction of clotting dysfunction in FVIII deficient mice by hydrodynamic delivery using the SB transposon system (Ohlfest et al, Blood 105: 2691, 2005). Current studies are focused on identifying conditions for effective hFVIII transposon delivery and long term expression in primary human B cells after Sleeping Beauty-mediated transposition. Results from these studies will be applicable to the development of a clinical protocol for treatment of human hemophilia by infusion of B cells genetically engineered using the Sleeping Beauty transposon system.

Recessive Dystrophic Epidermyolysis Bullosa (RDEB)

Epidermolysis bullosa is a group of genetic conditions that cause the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. Researchers classify dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa into three major types. Although the types differ in severity, their features overlap significantly and they are caused by mutations in the same gene. The autosomal recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) result from mutations in both copies of the COL7A1 gene in each cell.
Individuals with moderate and severe forms may have many complications and require psychological support along with attention to the care and protection of the skin and soft tissues. When blisters appear, the objectives of care are to reduce pain or discomfort, prevent excessive loss of body fluid, promote healing, and prevent infection. The doctor may prescribe a mild analgesic to prevent discomfort during changes of dressings (bandages).
Systemic delivery of collagen VII expressing ISP™ cells for the RDEB patient population offers some major advantages over other forms of therapy.  Recent data suggests that intravenously administered C7 could simultaneously migrate to the Dermal-Epidermal Junction (DEJ) throughout the RDEB patient’s skin, reverse the “subclinical”, microscopic epidermal-dermal separation and prophylactically prevent frank skin blisters and erosions from forming. We believe that protein therapy via intravenous C7 may be a valid therapeutic strategy for patients with RDEB who currently have few therapeutic options. [i]

Sarcopenia (Muscle Loss with Aging)

One of the most distinctive characteristics of older people is the presence of skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy. The term sarcopenia was used for the first time by Rosenberg to refer to the loss of lean body mass with aging. The prevalence of sarcopenia in the older population may range from 4% to 27% depending on the gender of the participants and country.
Immusoft has identified a suitable molecular candidate delivered by ISP™ cells to reverse the effects of age-related sarcopenia.



HIV

There exists a growing interest in interventions that either fully eradicate all replication-competent HIV (a “sterilizing” cure) or efforts that result in sustained control of persistent virus (often referred to
as a “functional cure”). Our overall vision is to target the viral reservoir using gene-modified autologous plasmablasts , which secrete a known broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from elite HIV suppressors. These antibodies will (1) enable the clearance of rare reservoir cells that spontaneously reactivate (during ART) leading to a gradual but eventually profound decrease in reservoir size and (2) prevent replication of any residual virus after ART is discontinued.
Immusoft has identified several broadly neutralizing antibodies to be delivered using an ISP™ cell therapy as a cell-based treatment option to prevent or even eradicate an HIV infection.



Atherosclerosis

Immusoft has identified a suitable molecular candidate delivered by ISP™ cells as an advanced treatment option for moderate to severe atherosclerosis.

the immusoft story




Immusoft’s mission is to develop a breakthrough autologous cell therapy platform for treating a variety of human diseases through our proprietary Immune System Programming (ISP™) technology. ISP™ technology can effectively re-program a patient’s own cells to become miniature drug factories in the body. The technology was designed to address current challenges faced with the production and delivery of conventional protein therapeutic drugs (biologics). The ISP™ platform enables safe insertion of genes encoding the correct human homolog of a missing or defective protein(s) into a patient’s immune cells using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system – a non-viral vector.
 
For decades, researchers have focused on gene therapy approaches to treat human diseases. Engineering viruses to insert or replace missing or defective genes with functional copies has been commonplace. However, engineered viruses require significant modification to efficiently infect target cell types, may be difficult to produce in the quantities needed for therapeutic use, most viruses’ have payload limitations, and are subject to immune clearance if seen as immunogenic (foreign to the body). Gene therapy involving viral transduction continues to be associated with real or perceived safety issues for therapeutic use in humans.
 
Immusoft’s ISP™ platform technology is hybrid cell/gene therapy approach, which uses a clinically validated, non-viral vector for safe, reliable insertion of functional genes into immune cells. Once administered back into the patient, a subset of ISP™ modified cells reside within survival niches in the body, continuously secreting gene-encoded protein(s). The platform’s broad utility to produce virtually any biologic drug entity, i.e. antibodies, proteins or enzymes, has the potential to disrupt the current standard of care for many diseases requiring recombinant enzyme replacement therapy, as well as, address orphan diseases with very small patient populations.

platform. This provides Immusoft with a highly efficient alternative to the current viral gene-delivery vehicles. In addition, we have an exclusive license option to core B-cell technology from the Baltimore lab at Caltech which provides a reliable methodology for the differentiation/amplification of modified B-cell-derived, plasma cell subsets expressing therapeutic proteins for introduction into the patient. We have filed two additional patent applications covering our extensive modifications to the technology.
 
Our lead indication is MPS-1 Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS-1) a lethal disease which results from the lack of a functional enzyme called α-L iduronidase (IDUA). In its most severe form, children die at the early age of 3 yrs. Otherwise known as Hurler Scheie-Syndrome, the disease requires frequent IDUA infusions, which are expensive and palliative at best. Long-term survival is difficult to achieve. A key 2015 Immusoft goal is the submission of an IND for the treatment of MPS-1 using re-programmed, patient-derived plasma cells to express high levels of IDUA. Achievement of this milestone will pave the way to the first clinical trial involving use of the
 
platform in human trials will position Immusoft to successfully build a pipeline of gene-based therapies to treat a number of serious diseases that currently have no effective therapeutic options. Our long term strategy is to advance internal programs for select indications and to work with strategic partners to find gene-based treatments for other serious diseases that represent areas of high medical need.

						Patient, Heal Thyself					

						May 1, 2016					

If the body is driven more by information than by chemistry, why not treat disease with information? This question led Matthew Scholz to biology, and, ultimately, to Immusoft Corporation, a Seattle company he founded in 2009. Immusoft technology programs B cells, part of the body’s immune system, to treat disease. … By tweaking the code that tells the cells what to produce, Immusoft can make them into tiny treatment factories that continue to operate inside the body. In March, Immusoft acquired Minneapolis-based Discovery Genomics, which has a process that makes it far easier and cheaper to program the cells.

						Adaptation of Humoral Memory					

						August 21, 2014					

Immunological memory, as provided by antibodies, depends on the continued presence of antibody-secreting cells, such as long-lived plasma cells of the bone marrow. Survival niches for these memory plasma cells are limited in number. In an established immune system, acquisition of new plasma cells, generated in response to recent pathogenic challenges, requires elimination of old memory plasma cells. Here, we review the adaptation of plasma cell memory to new pathogens…

Matthew Scholz has been told many times that his idea for reprogramming the body’s immune cells to create drugs was impossible. Maybe dangerous. Maybe just dumb. Scholz, a computer scientist with no formal biology training, could easily have been written off as a quixotic dreamer until this spring, when he got his breakout moment.

The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system in a non-viral carrier of genetic information that can insert a gene into vertebrate (human) chromosomes in order to confer a new function or replace a defective gene. The SB transposon system exhibits considerable promise as a long-lasting, safe way to insert genes into the chromosome of cells without using a viral vector.
Four patent applications covering the introduction of new genes into eukaryotic cells using the SB transposon system have been filed, with the base patent issued in 2002 (United States Patent 6,489,458; Hackett, et al., December 3, 2002; DNA based transposon system for the introduction of nucleic acid into the DNA of a cell).
The SB transposon system is a dynamic biological device that consists of:

1 The SB transposon.
2 The SB transposase which is specific to the SB transposon.
3 A therapeutic gene to be inserted into the host cell DNA. Once the system is introduced into the host cell, a transposase protein is expressed which cuts the target gene out of the SB transposon system and inserts it into the host DNA where the protein that the gene encodes can be expressed.






Immusoft is acquiring exclusive access to the SB transposon system though acquisition of Discovery Genomics (June 2015). This transaction will bring SB transposon IP,  deep know-how working with the SB system and gene therapy, as well as ongoing SBIR grants focused on use of the SB transposon system in several disease areas.
Work done by Discovery Genomics (DGI) and investigators around the globe have demonstrated the broad utility, the efficiency of gene incorporation and safety of the SB transposon system. Since it is non-viral, immunological reactions frequently associated with viral vectors are not anticipated. The SB transposon system comes with a proprietary Activation-Safe ™ that minimizes the possibility of unintentionally activating other genes, which is always a safety concern. Although integration of the Transposase gene is not expected, the gene has been intentionally inserted into mice and no adverse effects were observed over several generations involving hundreds of mice.


International validation has shown the original SBTS to be 10-fold more active than others.

				Matthew Scholz			

Chief Executive Officer


Matthew Scholz is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Immusoft, a biotech start-up firm that is developing a breakthrough technology that will turn a patient’s B cells into miniature drug factories. Longer term, this technology has the potential to transform the landscape of biomedicine.
 
With a background in computer security, Matthew’s initial concept for Immusoft’s core technology was based on using high speed cryptographic hardware to develop novel proteins to fight pathogens. In 2008, Matthew began conducting independent research in immunology and gene therapy and seeking input from some of the world’s top scientists. By 2009, he dramatically evolved the initial concept after conceiving how a research system developed by Nobel Laureate and former President of Caltech, David Baltimore, could be modified for a practical application: programming resting B cells to secrete therapeutic proteins. Matthew negotiated an exclusive license to the system, then developed and patented a way to improve its efficiency nearly seven-fold, thus making it clinically viable. This modified system is the core of Immusoft’s technology platform.
 
Along the way, Matthew has recruited a world-class team of scientists and biotech business experts to build Immusoft’s core technology and shape and drive the company. Immusoft’s extensive list of advisors includes experts in immunology, cell therapy, gene therapy, preclinical and clinical development, and CEOs of successful biotech companies. Matthew has also led Immusoft’s highly successful fundraising efforts. In March 2012, Immusoft was among the first to be awarded the Thiel Foundation’s Breakout Labs grant. The start-up has also received a grant from the National Institutes of Health and funds from private investors. In addition, Matthew has secured several valuable collaborations, including nearly $100k of work at no charge from academic labs during the company’s proof of concept stage.
 
With Immusoft as his third venture, Matthew has 13 years of experience connecting real-world needs with cutting-edge technical solutions. Prior projects include mobile application development and GPS-based fleet logistics (a start-up that he sold in 2009). He holds a degree in computer science from the University of Washington and is a frequent speaker at the University of Washington School of Business. Matthew also serves as mentor for the Thiel Fellowship, a program that awards $100k grants to some of the brightest scientific minds in the world who are under age 20.
