Published on Jul 22, 2017The late great Bobby Taylor, one of the greatest creators, producers, singers of the last 60 years. Bobby Taylor discovered Michael Jackson and the Jackson 5 in 1968 when they opened for Bobby Taylor & The Vancouvers (Tommy Chong was the guitar player!) at the Regal Theater, Chicago. Bobby brought the Jacksons to Berry Gordy and Motown, and the rest is history. Bobby trained and mentored the boys and produced the brilliant first 7 Jackson 5 albums–including megahits ABC, I Want You Back, Ben, I’ll be There, Rockin’ Robin, and many more. It was Bobby’s musical genius – his hands-on brilliant arrangements, production, songwriting and vocals that created the irresistible joy and character of the records. Bobby Taylor was irrepressible, irresistible, irreverent, and entirely adorable. This is Bobby Taylor singing to me, at 82 years old, October 2016, hanging out at Handlebar J's in Scottsdale AZ. Love you madly and miss you always and forever, Bobby.
