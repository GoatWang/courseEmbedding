Liftboats


We own and operate a fleet of 19 liftboats located in West Africa and the Middle East. Our well maintained and diverse fleet of vessels range from Class 105 to Class 280 and are capable of meeting a wide range of customer needs. We possess a proven track record of providing superior, versatile and reliable services to support construction and maintenance work on offshore development projects.
 
Liftboats, commonly referred to as the “workhorse” of the offshore industry, are reliable, versatile and self-propelled. They provide a cost-effective and efficient alternative to traditional pipelay/derrick vessels. With their large, open deck areas, they are self-propelling and self-elevating. Our fleet provides a work platform for a wide range of services, from coiled tubing and wireline operations to well intervention.
 
Our vessels are operated by highly trained personnel who adhere to a commitment to deliver safe and efficient operations. We maintain a rigorous maintenance and upgrade program to keep our fleet in line with the regulations and operating standards of the regions in which we operate. In addition, our teams of certified mechanics, crane inspectors and port engineers continuously monitor the status of our fleet to ensure a standard of operational reliability.
