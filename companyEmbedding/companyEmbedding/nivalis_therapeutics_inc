Alpine Immune Sciences has acquired Nivalis Therapeutics






  



  





Alpine/Nivalis Transaction
On April 18, 2017, Alpine and Nivalis announced a transaction combining the companies.
On July 24, 2017, this transaction was completed with Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. beginning trading July 25, 2017 on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker “ALPN”.
Alpine’s primary focus is developing novel protein‐based therapies using our variant immunoglobulin domain (vIgD™) platform technology. The vIgD platform is designed to create novel therapeutics that modulate multiple therapeutic targets, including many present in the immune synapse. Our vIgDs are developed via a unique process known as directed evolution which can produce proteins capable of either enhancing or diminishing an immune response, creating a platform applicable to both oncology and inflammatory diseases. For more information on Alpine’s vIgD platform, see the Our Science page.
As part of the transaction, Alpine obtained all rights to Nivalis’ GSNOR platform and related intellectual property. Described briefly to the right, Alpine seeks to outlicense this technology to an interested party. For more information on Nivalis’ GSNOR platform licensing opportunities, please contact us using the link below.

Nivalis Therapeutics
Nivalis Therapeutics developed a portfolio of novel disease modifying therapies designed to preserve intracellular GSNO (S-nitrosoglutathione) levels. GSNO is a molecule with cell signaling effects implicated in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other respiratory diseases. Nivalis’ lead candidate, cavosonstat (N91115), was evaluated in a phase 2 trial in patients with the F508del mutation, the most common disease-causing mutation in CF.
Alpine Immune Sciences is seeking opportunities to continue the development of cavosonstat (N91115) and the Nivalis clinical candidates and platform through out-licensing. If you are interested in cavosontat and related intellectual property, please contact us.
Nivalis Platform
Nivalis developed a broad portfolio of proprietary, investigational small molecule inhibitors of the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) protein which have been shown in preclinical studies to increase CFTR activity as well as decrease airway inflammation.
Nivalis’ drug candidate portfolio consists of multiple compounds which are designed for oral, intravenous (IV), or inhaled administration.
Lead Clinical Candidate
Cavosonstat (N91115), is an investigational small molecule that has the potential to address a defect in CFTR, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, the underlying cause of CF. Nivalis believed cavosonstat is a first-in-class CFTR stabilizer that modulates CFTR activity through a novel mechanism of action potentially complementary to existing and future CFTR modulators.
Cavosonstat is the only clinical stage product candidate Nivalis was aware of designed to stabilize CFTR inside the cell and at the cell surface. Nivalis has preclinical data demonstrating the stabilizing effect of cavosonstat increases and prolongs CFTR activity when added to other CFTR modulators.
GSNO and GSNOR
Endogenous S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) plays a critical role in modulating protein function through the transfer of nitric oxide to a protein thiol group, or S-nitrosation. Although administering GSNO directly has shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in preclinical models of cystic fibrosis and other diseases, it is limited as a chronic therapy for several reasons including difficulty in formulation and administration.
Depleted GSNO levels are believed to contribute to loss of airway function and pathology in CF lung disease due to dysregulated S-nitrosation. The S-nitrosation of certain proteins has been shown to modulate CFTR activity and decrease inflammation in preclinical human airway and animal models of disease. These targeted effects have been demonstrated to modify certain molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein or HOP which affect trafficking and stability of the F508del CFTR protein.
GSNO concentrations are regulated by GSNO reductase (GSNOR) an enzyme that breaks down GSNO. GSNOR, through its regulation of GSNO levels, plays a key role in pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology.
The Nivalis drug development strategy was based on the premise inhibiting of GSNOR should increase intracellular levels of GSNO by preventing its degradation, particularly in the setting of cystic fibrosis and other diseases with decreased levels of GSNO and/or increased GSNOR.

      effective July 24, 2017. The combined company changed its name to Alpine 
      Immune Sciences, Inc. immediately following the merger and is expected 
      to commence trading on The NASDAQ Global Market today, July 25, 2017, 
      under the ticker symbol “ALPN”.
    

      “The completion of this merger represents a significant milestone for 
      Alpine Immune Sciences and its shareholders, and most importantly for 
      physicians and their patients seeking a fundamentally new approach to 
      modulate the immune system to fight disease. Closing the merger, in 
      combination with the associated financing, provides us with the 
      resources to move forward as a focused, well-funded public company,” 
      said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Mitchell H. Gold. “With 
      our experienced team in place, and a potentially transformative 
      development pipeline of first in class molecules, we believe that Alpine 
      has both the experience and the resources to develop novel therapeutic 
      approaches that address inflammation, cancer, and other diseases.”
    

      Upon the completion of the merger and financing, Alpine will have 
      approximately $90 million in cash and cash equivalents. This includes 
      proceeds from a financing that closed immediately prior to the merger in 
      which Alpine received gross proceeds of approximately $17 million in new 
      investment from current Alpine investors, OrbiMed Advisors, Frazier 
      Healthcare Partners, and Alpine BioVentures. "The continued support from 
      our existing investors in this financing is a strong endorsement of our 
      program’s transformative potential and the scientists at Alpine, to 
      address some of the most challenging unmet medical needs,” said Dr. Gold.
    

      Alpine is focused on the development of innovative immunotherapies. 
      Alpine’s proprietary variant immunoglobulin domain™ (“vIgD”) platform 
      uses a process known as directed evolution to create therapeutics 
      capable of modulating multiple human immune system proteins in the 
      immune synapse through a single molecule. In Alpine’s pre-clinical 
      studies, the vIgD platform has identified novel proteins with the 
      ability to either enhance or diminish an immune response. These proteins 
      could be potentially applicable therapeutically to both oncology 
      (cancer) and inflammatory diseases. Alpine has also developed its 
      transmembrane immunomodulatory protein™ (“TIP”™) technology, based on 
      the vIgD platform, to potentially enhance engineered cellular therapies. 
      Alpine intends to apply for clearance for its first molecule, a dual 
      ICOS/CD28 antagonist, to begin clinical trials in the second half of 
      2018.
    

      Following the completion of the merger, Alpine shareholders, option 
      holders and warrant holders own, or have rights to acquire, 
      approximately 74 percent of the combined company, and former Nivalis 
      shareholders, option holders and warrant holders own, or have rights to 
      acquire, approximately 26 percent of the combined company.
    

About Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc.


      Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. is focused on developing novel 
      protein‐based immunotherapies using its proprietary Variant 
      Ig Domain vIgD 
      platform technology. The vIgD platform is designed to interact with 
      multiple targets, including many present in the immune synapse. Alpine’s 
      vIgDs are developed using a process known as directed evolution, which 
      can potentially produce proteins capable of either enhancing or 
      diminishing an immune response and thereby may potentially apply 
      therapeutically to both oncology and inflammatory diseases. Alpine has 
      also developed its TIP technology, based on the vIgD platform, to 
      potentially enhance engineered cellular therapies. In October 2015, 
      Alpine signed a worldwide research and license agreement with Kite 
      Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ:KITE) for up to $535 million in up front and 
      potential milestone payments plus royalties on resulting sales. The 
      agreement allows Kite access to certain targets developed using Alpine’s 
      TIP platform. For more information visit www.alpineimmunesciences.com/.
    

Forward-Looking Statements


This communication contains forward-looking statements (including 
      within the meaning of Section 21E of the United States Securities 
      Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the United States 
      Securities Act of 1933, as amended) concerning Nivalis Alpine, the 
      merger and financing transaction, Alpine’s platform technology, 
      potential therapies, clinical and regulatory objectives and milestone 
      and royalty payment potential and other matters. These statements may 
      discuss goals, intentions and expectations as to future plans, trends, 
      events, results of operations or financial condition, or otherwise, 
      based on current beliefs of the management of Alpine, as well as 
      assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. 
      Forward-looking statements generally include statements that are 
      predictive in nature and depend upon or refer to future events or 
      conditions, and include words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “would,” 
      “expect,” “plan,” “believe,” “intend,” “look forward,” and other similar 
      expressions among others. Statements that are not historical facts are 
      forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on 
      current beliefs and assumptions that are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual 
      results could differ materially from those contained in any 
      forward-looking statement as a result of various factors, including, 
      without limitation: the ability of Alpine to protect its intellectual 
      property rights; unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from 
      the merger; potential adverse changes resulting from the announcement or 
      completion of the merger; that Alpine’s discovery-stage and pre-clinical 
      programs do not advance into the clinic or result in approved products 
      on a timely or cost effective basis or at all; and legislative, 
      regulatory, political and economic developments. Alpine’s pipeline 
      programs, including ALPN-101, are in pre-clinical development, and the 
      process by which a pre-clinical therapeutic candidate could potentially 
      lead to an approved therapeutic is long and subject to significant risks 
      and uncertainties. Risks facing Alpine and its programs are set 
      forth in Alpine’s filings with the SEC. Except as required by applicable 
      law, Alpine undertakes no obligation to revise or update any 
      forward-looking statement, or to make any other forward-looking 
      statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or

Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc. and Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. Company Profile

07:19 EDT 27th July 2017 | BioPortfolio











      Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc. (http://www.nivalis.com) 
      is a pharmaceutical company that has historically been focused on the 
      discovery and development of product candidates for patients with cystic 
      fibrosis, or CF. The Companyâs development candidates selectively target 
      an enzyme known as S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR). GSNOR 
      regulates levels of an endogenous protein known as S-nitrosoglutathione 
      (GSNO). Depleted levels of GSNO have been associated with CF, asthma, 
      inflammatory bowel diseases and certain cardiovascular diseases. 
      Following recent disappointing results of a Phase 2 clinical trial of 
      its lead product candidate, cavosonstat, in CF, Nivalis determined to 
      not pursue the development of this compound in CF and to wind down its 
      research and development activities while devoting its efforts to 
      investigating and evaluating strategic alternatives.

Alpine Immune Sciences has acquired Nivalis Therapeutics






  



  





Alpine/Nivalis Transaction
On April 18, 2017, Alpine and Nivalis announced a transaction combining the companies.
On July 24, 2017, this transaction was completed with Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc. beginning trading July 25, 2017 on the NASDAQ National Market under the ticker “ALPN”.
Alpine’s primary focus is developing novel protein‐based therapies using our variant immunoglobulin domain (vIgD™) platform technology. The vIgD platform is designed to create novel therapeutics that modulate multiple therapeutic targets, including many present in the immune synapse. Our vIgDs are developed via a unique process known as directed evolution which can produce proteins capable of either enhancing or diminishing an immune response, creating a platform applicable to both oncology and inflammatory diseases. For more information on Alpine’s vIgD platform, see the Our Science page.
As part of the transaction, Alpine obtained all rights to Nivalis’ GSNOR platform and related intellectual property. Described briefly to the right, Alpine seeks to outlicense this technology to an interested party. For more information on Nivalis’ GSNOR platform licensing opportunities, please contact us using the link below.

Nivalis Therapeutics
Nivalis Therapeutics developed a portfolio of novel disease modifying therapies designed to preserve intracellular GSNO (S-nitrosoglutathione) levels. GSNO is a molecule with cell signaling effects implicated in the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other respiratory diseases. Nivalis’ lead candidate, cavosonstat (N91115), was evaluated in a phase 2 trial in patients with the F508del mutation, the most common disease-causing mutation in CF.
Alpine Immune Sciences is seeking opportunities to continue the development of cavosonstat (N91115) and the Nivalis clinical candidates and platform through out-licensing. If you are interested in cavosontat and related intellectual property, please contact us.
Nivalis Platform
Nivalis developed a broad portfolio of proprietary, investigational small molecule inhibitors of the S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) protein which have been shown in preclinical studies to increase CFTR activity as well as decrease airway inflammation.
Nivalis’ drug candidate portfolio consists of multiple compounds which are designed for oral, intravenous (IV), or inhaled administration.
Lead Clinical Candidate
Cavosonstat (N91115), is an investigational small molecule that has the potential to address a defect in CFTR, resulting from mutations in the CFTR gene, the underlying cause of CF. Nivalis believed cavosonstat is a first-in-class CFTR stabilizer that modulates CFTR activity through a novel mechanism of action potentially complementary to existing and future CFTR modulators.
Cavosonstat is the only clinical stage product candidate Nivalis was aware of designed to stabilize CFTR inside the cell and at the cell surface. Nivalis has preclinical data demonstrating the stabilizing effect of cavosonstat increases and prolongs CFTR activity when added to other CFTR modulators.
GSNO and GSNOR
Endogenous S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) plays a critical role in modulating protein function through the transfer of nitric oxide to a protein thiol group, or S-nitrosation. Although administering GSNO directly has shown potential as a therapeutic intervention in preclinical models of cystic fibrosis and other diseases, it is limited as a chronic therapy for several reasons including difficulty in formulation and administration.
Depleted GSNO levels are believed to contribute to loss of airway function and pathology in CF lung disease due to dysregulated S-nitrosation. The S-nitrosation of certain proteins has been shown to modulate CFTR activity and decrease inflammation in preclinical human airway and animal models of disease. These targeted effects have been demonstrated to modify certain molecular chaperones, such as Hsp70/Hsp90 organizing protein or HOP which affect trafficking and stability of the F508del CFTR protein.
GSNO concentrations are regulated by GSNO reductase (GSNOR) an enzyme that breaks down GSNO. GSNOR, through its regulation of GSNO levels, plays a key role in pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular physiology and pathophysiology.
The Nivalis drug development strategy was based on the premise inhibiting of GSNOR should increase intracellular levels of GSNO by preventing its degradation, particularly in the setting of cystic fibrosis and other diseases with decreased levels of GSNO and/or increased GSNOR.
