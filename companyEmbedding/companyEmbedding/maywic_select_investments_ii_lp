Maywic Select Investments was founded by Fred Mayerson and Chad Wick. Life-long friends, business partners, and colleagues, both men have significant professional accomplishments. Fred established a track record in business as an investor, owner and operator and Chad as a commercial banking executive and leader of one of the country’s more important national philanthropic organizations focused on education. They remain closely connected through both business and social causes.Their story can be defined by one word: relationships. To be more specific, it’s relationships that are based on honesty, integrity and authenticity. It is those relationships that lead to access to deals and deal sources that most other groups cannot access and allow us to provide extended support for our portfolio companies.They blend those values with their expertise, engaging in what they love and investing in skilled and invested management teams that have the potential to accelerate growth from arithmetic to geometry.They confer with a highly regarded group of industry leaders who are friends and colleagues. They provide market intelligence, deal flow, operating expertise, and strategic guidance.Maywic Select Investments operates on the basis of pledge commitments by a select number of participants.



Who We AreWe invest in skilled and invested management teams and we support them by sharing our experience in building businesses that last.We invest in products and services we love. We focus on what we know – bears, toys, crackers - with a growing interest in health, wellness, and fitness. We are particularly interested in simple businesses with tangible products that are utilizing technology and social media to transform their business models.



Our FocusOur primary focus is on investment in "Big Idea" companies with dedicated, skilled and invested leaders that can grow dynamically by building game-changing businesses.  We help entrepreneurs realize their potential with a flexible investment approach.We invest in companies that would benefit from our know-how and access to resources.  Maywic considers investment in both early stage ventures as well    as mid and later stage post-revenue businesses.  What matters to us is how we can help.When we invest, we address the capital needs of the company and make follow-on investments to support the growth and health of our portfolio companies.We focus on building companies over time and are committed to helping maximize their values.
