The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS. Donnelley Financial, LLC. d/b/a EDGAR Online and the information providers herein make no claims concerning the validity of the information provided hereby and will not be held liable for any use of this information.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please   
    click here.

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided.

    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.

OppenheimerFunds Launches Three New Revenue-Weighted ETFs









PR Newswire




Jul 13, 2017 11:00 AM EDT













 




























































  NEW YORK, July 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OppenheimerFunds, a leading global asset manager, is expanding its Beta Solutions product offerings with the launch of three new revenue-weighted ETFs in the emerging, global and international market segments. The firm has introduced Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Revenue ETF (REEM), Oppenheimer Global Revenue ETF (RGLB), and Oppenheimer International Revenue ETF (REFA).     "Our newest ETF solutions were created in direct response to our clients' growing appetite for revenue-weighted strategies in the global marketplace," said Sharon French, Head of Beta Solutions at OppenheimerFunds. "Our approach offers a durable value proposition, with attractive risk-adjusted performance and the broad market diversification that has historically attracted investors to index strategies."   Oppenheimer Emerging Markets Revenue ETF (REEM) seeks to outperform the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with an expense ratio of 46 basis points.  Oppenheimer Global Revenue ETF (RGLB) seeks to outperform the MSCI All Country World Index, with an expense ratio of 43 basis points.  Oppenheimer International Revenue ETF (REFA) seeks to outperform the MSCI EAFE Index, with an expense ratio of 42 basis points.   The securities in each of the new funds are weighted by their trailing 12-month top-line revenue, rather than their market capitalization, with a 5% maximum portfolio weight for any one issuer. The funds are rebalanced quarterly. Oppenheimer's fundamentally weighted ETFs offer a way for advisors, wealth managers, and consultants to access broad market exposure in a potentially more optimal way than traditional market capitalization strategies. By weighting securities in broad market indices based on revenue rather than market capitalization, the fundamentally weighted strategies offer the opportunity to reduce overexposure to potentially overpriced sectors and stocks while still providing the broad diversification of an index.

3 New ETFs: Oppenheimer Adds To Revenue-Weighted Lineup 

RevenueShares Debuts New Global Growth ETF 

Apple In Focus Ahead Of Earnings As 2 Big-Cap Funds Set Up (Investor's Business Daily)



 
Count Oppenheimer as the latest exchange-traded funds to tap the burgeoning environmental, social and governance (ESG) trend. Last week, the firm debuted the Oppenheimer Revenue Weighted ETF Trust Oppenheimer ESG Revenue ETF (NYSE: ESGL) and the Oppenheimer Revenue Weighted ETF Trust Oppenheimer Global ESG Revenue ETF (NYSE: ESGF).
2 New ESG ETFs
ESGL and ESGF continue the RevenueShares, the issuer acquired by Oppenheimer, of revenue-weighted ETFs. That group includes seasoned offerings, such as the RevenueShares ETF Trust (NYSE: RDIV) and the RevenueShares Large Cap Fund (ETF) (NYSE: RWL).
The new Oppenheimer ESG Revenue ETF holds the same stocks found in the S&P 500, but the ETF weights those stocks by revenue, not market capitalization.
ESGL's “ESG practices are evaluated using a proprietary ESG scoring methodology developed by the firm Sustainalytics. The revenue weightings are based on the OFI Revenue Weighted Strategies Team’s proprietary weighting methodology. We believe this approach has a durable value proposition as it offers investors exposure to large-cap U.S. stocks with strong ESG practices,” according to Oppenheimer. 
Weight And Holdings
Consumer staples, consumer discretionary and technology stocks combine for over half of the new ETF's weight. Top 10 holdings include Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T). The Oppenheimer Global ESG Revenue ETF culls its holdings from the widely followed MSCI All Country World Index and also weights those holdings on revenue, not market value.
ESGF holds “global large- and mid-cap stocks that have strong Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) practices. ESG practices are evaluated on the basis of a proprietary ESG scoring methodology developed by MSCI ESG Research,” noted Oppenheimer. 
“Academic research has revealed that strong governance mechanisms have helped diminish default risk and lower bond yields. The ESG principle are more of a way of living or conducting business that correspond with a firm’s core values. Many companies have defined their corporate social responsibility to account for their impact on the environment and social welfare even if there is no legal requirement,” notes ETF Trends.
ESGF has annual fee of 0.45 percent while ESGL charges 0.4 percent per year.
