 Scientific Director, Searle Scholars Program Research Interests The Fambrough lab at The Johns Hopkins University closed its doors in 2004.  In the years just prior to that, Dr. Fambrough's research group studied the mechanisms by which cells regulate the number and spatial distribution of their membrane proteins, focusing upon integral membrane proteins that come to reside in the lysosomal membrane (LAMP-1and LAMP 2), the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca-ATPase), and the plasma membrane (Na,K-ATPase). The lab cloned encoding DNAs for each of these proteins from avian cDNA libraries and expressed these DNAs in tissue cultured mammalian cells, where each avian protein was correctly sorted and localized. Monoclonal antibodies specific for each avian protein were developed and used to quantify expression and to determine cellular distribution.  Sorting signals and, for the Na,K-ATPase the sites for inter-subunit interaction, were mapped and further defined. 
				
				The monoclonal antibodies to these membrane proteins have been donated to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, a non-profit center for distribution of hybridoma cells and antibodies.  To obtain antibodies, contact the center at: 
				
http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu

				Monoclonal antibodies to a variety of extracellular matrix proteins and to human acetylcholinesterase were also developed and given to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank.

 Scientific Director, Searle Scholars Program Research Interests The Fambrough lab at The Johns Hopkins University closed its doors in 2004.  In the years just prior to that, Dr. Fambrough's research group studied the mechanisms by which cells regulate the number and spatial distribution of their membrane proteins, focusing upon integral membrane proteins that come to reside in the lysosomal membrane (LAMP-1and LAMP 2), the sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca-ATPase), and the plasma membrane (Na,K-ATPase). The lab cloned encoding DNAs for each of these proteins from avian cDNA libraries and expressed these DNAs in tissue cultured mammalian cells, where each avian protein was correctly sorted and localized. Monoclonal antibodies specific for each avian protein were developed and used to quantify expression and to determine cellular distribution.  Sorting signals and, for the Na,K-ATPase the sites for inter-subunit interaction, were mapped and further defined. 
				
				The monoclonal antibodies to these membrane proteins have been donated to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, a non-profit center for distribution of hybridoma cells and antibodies.  To obtain antibodies, contact the center at: 
				
http://dshb.biology.uiowa.edu

				Monoclonal antibodies to a variety of extracellular matrix proteins and to human acetylcholinesterase were also developed and given to the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank.

Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Dicerna Pharmaceuticals first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Peter Vozzo. Sir, you may begin.
Peter Vozzo
Good afternoon, and welcome to Dicerna's conference call to discuss 2015 first quarter financial and operational results.
For anyone who has not had the chance to review our results, we issued a press release after close of market today, outlining today's announcement, which is available under the Investor and Media tab on our website at www.dicerna.com. You can also listen to this conference call via webcast on our website, and it will be archived there for 30 days beginning approximately two hours after this call is completed.
I'd like to remind listeners that we'll make forward-looking statements on today's call, therefore, I'd like to remind you that today's discussion will include statements about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today.
In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. While we maybe elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our views change.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Douglas Fambrough, Dicerna's Chief Executive Officer.
Douglas Fambrough
Thank you, Peter. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you who have dialed in to the call today. Joining me to present on the call is Jim Dentzer, our Chief Financial Officer. We are pleased to be able to provide you with this first quarter update.
Dicerna continues to make positive progress on key clinical objectives for our development programs for two-key product candidates, DCR-PH1, our program for primary hyperoxaluria type 1 or PH1, which is a rare inherited liver metabolic disorder, and DCR-MYC, our oncology program targeting the MYC oncogene.
In addition, we continue to make positive progress on our extended Dicer substrate platform, demonstrating effective gene silencing with subcutaneously administered DsiRNA-EX Conjugate molecules, which are the basis of our earlier-stage liver targeted programs.
As a reminder, Dicerna is a RNA interference or RNAi-based biopharmaceutical company, focused on treating specific indications in rare inherited diseases involving the liver and genetically defined oncology targets using Dicerna's proprietary RNAi molecules known as Dicer substrates or DsiRNAs.
We're pursuing targets that have historically been difficult to inhibit, using conventional pharmaceutical approaches, but are accessible by RNAi, where connections between those targets and diseases are well understood and documented. We seek to retain substantial commercial rights to our key programs.
To discuss our progress in more detail, I'd like to begin with our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology that enables subcutaneous delivery to the liver. These conjugates do not involve lipid nanoparticles and are built on our DsiRNA-EX technology, using an extension to one end of the double-stranded DsiRNA molecule.

As you may recall from our R&D update in December 2014, we showed greater than 90% gene knockdown after a single subcutaneous administration in mice, with potency such that we can achieve 50% gene knockdown with only 2 milligrams of DsiRNA-EX Conjugate per kilogram of body weight.
Recently at the 17th Annual TIDES conference, we provided additional data on our DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology, extending our observations to non-human primates. And the work presented at TIDES, we showed that we can achieve greater than 50% gene knockdown with 5 milligrams of DsiRNA-EX Conjugate per kilogram body weight, demonstrating effective translation of the DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology from rodents to primates.
In addition, the nadir level of transcript knockdown was observed to continue beyond one month after a single dose, showing a very long duration of effect. We believe these results are supportive of clinical application of the DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology. To that end, we are utilizing DsiRNA-EX Conjugates in our to-be-announced liver programs, including novel rare disease, and have DsiRNA-EX Conjugates in optimization against four additional liver targets, with more programs planned.
I would like to turn next to our DCR-PH1 program for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria type 1. PH1 is a rare disease, where an error in liver metabolism causes patients to have high levels of oxalate in the urine, resulting in progressive and severe damage to the kidneys.
Existing disease management practices for PH1 may slow, but do not stop disease progression. And most patients eventually experience complete kidney failure, with the median age of kidney failure being in the early 30s. Aside from dual liver-kidney transplant, there are no effective treatments and no FDA approved therapies for most patients with PH1.
Two aspects of PH1 make it particularly attractive as a program for Dicerna. First, PH1 is a natural application of Dicerna's technology, based on the clear genetic basis of the disease, and the fact that the disease metabolism seems to occur exclusively or nearly exclusively in the liver.
Second, PH1 presents clear and easily assayed biomarkers, urinary oxalate and glycolate levels, and these markers provide a direct readout of the mechanism of pathology in PH1. As we've discussed before, we have generated highly encouraging data in the main animal model of primary hyperoxaluria type 1.
In this model, mice have been genetically engineered to carry the same metabolic defect found in PH1 patients. These mice have elevated levels of urinary oxalate, roughly three times the normal background levels. That level of elevation is similar to the elevated levels commonly observed in patients with PH1.
Using our DCR-PH1 product candidate to knockdown the targeted HAO1 gene transcript in these mice at doses of 0.3 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, we saw reductions in urinary oxalate levels to background or near background levels. We believe that similar results, if observed in patients with PH1, would have a significant beneficial impact on disease progression.
In normal non-human primates, we have shown that a single dose of DCR-PH1 at 0.3 milligrams per kilogram bodyweight, leads to an average of 84% gene knockdown with up to 93% knockdown observed four days after dosing. 29 days after a single 0.3 milligram per kilogram dose in non-human primates, we see an average or 68% gene target knockdown with up to 86% knockdown observed.
As previously disclosed, we are initiating a natural history study of PH1. This study will enroll 50 to 75 patients with genetically confirmed diagnosis of PH1, excluding patients on dialysis. The objectives of the study are to characterize the natural history of PH1, estimate changes in oxalate and glycolate levels and renal function over time among others.

We believe this information will provide a historical group for comparison to data from clinical trials, and will facilitate the clinical development of DCR-PH1. In an important regulatory milestone, we announced last month that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted orphan drug designation to DCR-PH1 for the treatment of PH1.
Dicerna continues to advance the DCR-PH1 program per our internal timeline, with an IND filing in the third quarter and clinical initiation in the fourth quarter. Studies in non-human primates have refined our expectations for data readout from the trial.
Observations in non-human primates have demonstrated two important points that affect our timeline expectations. First, we have seen substantially longer target enzyme half-life in non-human primates compared to mice, and thus movement in key metabolite biomarkers takes longer to be observed.
And second, greater levels of RNAi knockdown are required for enzyme silencing in non-human primates compared with mice, which suggests that we may need to achieve high levels of the gene knockdown in PH1 patients before observing biomarker movement. These phenomena combined suggest that we may need to go to higher dose cohorts before observing robust biomarker response during the Phase 1 trial. We therefore expect this data to emerge in the first half of 2016.
I'd now like to turn to our second product candidate, DCR-MYC, which is our DsiRNA-based therapeutic, targeting the MYC oncogene, formulated in our tumor-centric on core lipid nanoparticle formulation. DCR-MYC is currently being tested in two ongoing clinical trials.
Dicerna selected MYC as a high-priority target to silence with our DsiRNA technology, because it is frequently amplified or otherwise up-regulated in a wide variety of tumor types. Because MYC is a protein, which lacks the good small molecular binding site, it has been a challenging target for small molecule therapy, and has been an elusive target for drug developers for decades.
We believe our Dicer substrate RNAi platform overcomes this limitation, because we don't target the protein, rather we target the RNA transcript. Our preclinical data for DCR-MYC demonstrate specific and significant MYC gene knockdown in multiple tumor-bearing mouse models.
DCR-MYC entered Phase 1 clinical testing in April of 2014, in patients with solid tumors, multiple myeloma or lymphoma. The Phase 1 trial endpoints include safety and tolerability, and we'll identify the maximum tolerated dose, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic effects and antitumor activity of DCR-MYC.
We are evaluating antitumor activity by resist, using conventional imaging techniques such as CT and MRI. In addition, we have incorporated FDG-PET imaging in the study, as FDG uptake by tumors may serve as a useful biomarker of MYC activity.
Reductions in MYC activity are predicted to cause a decrease in tumor metabolic rate, which can be visualized by imaging glucose uptake using the FDG-PET imaging technology. FDG-PET is also a marker of early detection of response across several tumor types.
Once we have achieved the maximum tolerated dose in the study, we will be taking biopsies from patient tumors, in which we will seek to identify the direct products of RNAi cleavage of the MYC transcript. We hope to establish proof of concept for DCR-MYC by showing resist responses in patients in conjunction with reduced FDG uptake and demonstration of RNAi activity against the MYC transcript. We continue to expect a readout from this Phase 1 trial by the end of 2015.
Contingent upon achieving proof of concept with DCR-MYC, we will launch our second oncology program targeting beta-catenin into IND-enabling studies. We are pleased with the progress of the DCR-MYC trial so far, including our patient enrollment rate. We have escalated through several dose levels and we're continuing with the dose escalation process. We have not identified a maximum tolerated dose.

Preliminary results from early dose cohorts of the trial will be discussed in an oral presentation at the upcoming ASCO conference. As we have not identified a maximum tolerated dose, and thus are not taking biopsies, this presentation will not include the molecular data on RNAi activity.
In the December 2014, we initiated a second clinical study of DCR-MYC, a Phase 1b/2 study in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC, who have either failed sorafenib, or are intolerant to sorafenib, or who don't have access to other therapies for HCC.
The first patient in this study was dosed in January 2015. We selected HCC as an initial focus indication for DCR-MYC, both due to the observation that the MYC gene is frequently amplified in HCC patients and due to the commercial and competitive profile of the HCC market.
HCC is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide. Patients with advanced HCC had limited treatments options and there are now approved therapies for those who do not respond or do not tolerate standard of care treatment with sorafenib. We have sites for the HCC clinical trial both in the U.S. and in Asia due to the high prevalence of this disease in the Asian population.
Now, I will turn over the call to our Chief Financial Officer, James Dentzer, for an update on our financial progress. Jim?
James Dentzer
Thank you, Doug. As many of you have seen, we filed our 10-Q today. There was a great deal of detail contained in that document. I would like to focus on the main financial metrics that we believe are important to use when evaluating the efficiency of our business. In the first quarter of 2015, Dicerna had a net loss of $14.1 million compared to a net loss of $11 million for the same period in 2014.
Research and development expenses were $8.7 million for the first quarter of 2015 compared to $5.3 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to the initiation of clinical trials related to DCR-MYC, an increase in research activities related to DCR-PH1, and increased employee-related expenses partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $0.9 million.
General and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2015 totaled $5.4 million compared to $2.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily from the increased costs of operating as a public company, and an increase in payroll-related expenses, which includes an increase in stock-based compensation of $1 million.
As of March 31, 2015, the company had $87.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and held to maturity investments as compared to $98.6 million in cash and cash equivalent and held to maturity investments as of December 31, 2014.
Based on our current position and operating plan, the company reiterates its expectations that it has sufficient cash to fund operations through the end of 2016. This estimate assumes no additional partnership funding and no new debt or equity financings. More detailed financial information and analysis maybe found in the company's annual report and its quarterly report on form 10-Q filed today with the SEC.
With that, I will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Schmidt of Leerink.
Michael Schmidt
So I'm trying to understand your statement around the DCR-PH1 PK/PD relationship between mouse and non-human primates. And I guess, based on that, what level knockdown do you believe you need to achieve in humans to achieve an effective biomarkers, in your view?
Douglas Fambrough
Sure. So it's difficult to predict across species, but what I can do is give a little more clarity on the knockdown from a non-human primates and knockdown from the mouse model. So with 75% gene knockdown in the mouse model, we found that we could start to see movement in the biomarkers. And in order to see movement on the biomarkers in the non-human primates, you need to go to 85% or so before we'd see that moving, and get up towards 90% to see the really strong movement.

So our expectations for the amount of knockdown that we need to see in humans, we track along side the non-human primates. And that would suggest that the doses that we're likely to start at in the Phase 1 trial, which might have hit the 75% threshold, may not hit the 85% to 90% threshold, and we may need to go deeper in those escalation before the biomarkers move. Is that helpful, Michael?
Michael Schmidt
Yes, and so you're talking 85% to 90% transcript knockdown or protein level knockdown?
Douglas Fambrough
We're talking transcript knockdown. Now, we will not be collecting biopsies from the livers of patients in the Phase 1 trial. So we will not get data on the transcript knockdown from patients.
Michael Schmidt
And I guess dosing frequency, is that another variable that could affect those parameters?
Douglas Fambrough
In the long-term, which is to say going to a multiple dose chronic treatment, I don't think it's going to have a very major effect because of the duration of effective RNAi in primates, if what matters is driving to therapeutic threshold levels. And then I think the kind of duration, which we have been hoping to achieve, we'll call that a minimum of 173 weeks, but a target of once monthly. I think that's very achievable to stay below even a higher threshold with the monthly dosing interval. So at this point, not thinking about any increased frequency required in the long-term.
Michael Schmidt
And then I had a question on the recent TIDES presentation. So you included some data of a GalNAc conjugate formulated oligo-targeting HAO1, and I was wondering, a, if you had any plans for a subcutaneous formulated product for this indication along the term; and number two, the potency that you've observed with the subcutaneously administered product in non-human primates, I guess, how does that compare to other gene knockdown technologies?
Douglas Fambrough
So we have pursued our DsiRNA-EX-Conjugate technology against the HAO1 gene, which gives us the option of continuing through a formal development program to produce a subcutaneous inhibitor. And at this point, we have not committed to such a development program, but we have the option to do so, and may do so in the future.
With respect to the potency of the DsiRNA-EX-Conjugate technology, I think that compares very comparably to the data that is been presented by competitors. Somewhere if you take down myeloma as a specific competitor, the technology appears to have a potency and a duration of action that looks more like what they would describe their ESC technology, than it does what they describe is their standard chemistry, which was incorporated in the TTRsc program.
So I think in a more general statement one would say, we feel the potency that we have achieved and demonstrated through the IC50 results both in mice and non-human primates demonstrates a competitive potency profile such that it would lead to a competitive product profile as well.
Michael Schmidt
And then maybe back to the PH1 program. Are the metabolic pathways, how conserved are those between mice, non-humans primates, and humans?
Douglas Fambrough
To the best of knowledge, the pathways are well conserved. One needs to recognize that this is not the most heavily researched part of human physiology. That said, the pathway is part of a common metabolic breakdown pathway than any vertebrate animal has as part of its metabolic repertoire.
The primary role of the pathway is detoxification of hydroxyproline, which is about 10% by collagen by weight. And looking across genomic information, you see conservation of the relevant enzymes in the pathway, if you look at gene expression databases, you see that there is a general conservation of the special distribution of expression as well, which is to say that the pathway is active in the liver. Those surveys do not have cellular resolution, but as far as we have observed in the mice, its just hepatocyte activity.

Given the common biochemical problem and the conservation of the enzymes both with respect to sequence identity and level of expression at the organ level, I think it's very likely that the pathway is very conserved. It is worth mentioning though that this pathway is not the only source of oxalate, and there do appear to be differences between rodents and primates with respect to other sources of oxalate, specifically regarding differences in vitamin C metabolism. These differences are predicted to result in a higher background level of oxalate in the rodents compared to primates as is observed.
We do not believe this will impact the therapeutic activity of the product. It is relevant to comparing baseline oxalate levels, but not to thinking about the dynamics of oxalate production through this pathway and it is this specific pathway, which is impacted in primary hyperoxaluria type 1.
Thus, in conclusion, to the best understanding of the pathway today, we would predict good conservation, and in our observations to non-human primates to date including data that we have not presented, such as elevations in urinary glycolate in non-human primates after treatment with DCR-PH1. We remain optimistic that the therapeutic mechanism will translate very nicely from the mouse model of disease to patient.
Michael Schmidt
And are you planning to present more non-human primate data at some point in the near future on some of those findings?
Douglas Fambrough
Not in the near future, but we would expect to have substantial presentation at the next PH1 focus meeting.
Operator
And our next question comes from Stephen Willey of Stifel.
Stephen Willey
Can you just remind us what's the magnitude in terms of the directional movement and enzymatic biomarkers that you need to see in order to recapitulate the phenotype in the rodent model? And I guess, when you talk about 75% knockdown as being initiating of that movement of the biomarker movement that translates into an approximate what level of reduction in terms of the markers themselves?
Douglas Fambrough
So this is an interesting question to answer. In one-on-one meetings I frequently make the comment that, I don't think talking about percent reduction is really the right way to do it, even though that's the way the field has traditionally done it. So let me start by just giving some facts about oxalate in the disease and in normal individuals.
Normal oxalate is standardly written as less than 0.46 of the units that are used, millimoles per body surface area per day. The median oxalate in PH1 patient is 1.8, so roughly four times the background. At the 75th percentile they're up at 2.7. Now, in the field physicians' talk about 30% reduction in oxalate as being what is really clinically interesting. So I think the way to think about that is a 30% reduction from the median.
Now, let me take this in a slightly different direction. There is a well-documented correlation between oxalate level in the urine and long-term kidney outcome. And the way that data has been presented, I don't have access to all the background data that went into it, the way that date has been presented, it oxalate is below 1.3 than the risk of kidney failure over a decadal scale reduces to near zero.
So I think it's more appropriate to think of 1.3 as a threshold level that we want to achieve, and if you do the math, 30% reduction from 1.8 and 1.3, that's a same place. The amount of reduction that we see in the mouse model is on the order of 55% or so. Pick the time data point that you want to measure, so substantially more than what the field is looking for.
That encourages us that even if there are some differences between species that DCR-PH1 and this mechanism of action has the capability to exceed a 30% reduction, and to lower oxalate levels below the 1.3 level that one might use as a threshold for a significant therapeutic effect.

Stephen Willey
So we should think about then I guess your dose escalation efforts then really being targeted towards that 1.3 number as oppose to kind of a threshold percentage reduction.
Douglas Fambrough
I'm hesitating and agreeing with that, because clinical trials historically in this indication have used percent reduction. And whether we continue to use percent reduction as a clinical endpoint or whether in conjunction with the FDA we define a threshold, that's a decision that will be made in the future.
I think it's useful to make sure that people understand that in the Phase 1 trial patients may have some body burden of oxalate crystals that will dissolve and contribute to oxalate in the urine, which could buffer the reduction of oxalate that we observed in a single dose trial.
We do expect to see real-time elevations in glycolate, and we suggest that people look at both of those biomarkers, and we very much do expect to see oxalate reductions. But if we have a major reduction in oxalate production in the liver, you may see some additional solubilization of existing oxalate crystals.
The enrollment criteria for the Phase 1, we'll attempt to select patients that do not have a lot of oxalate burden already. For later stage trials, we'll take probably all patients and we'll include enough time to washout existing oxalate levels.
Stephen Willey
And then just a question on PCR mix. So I think you had indicated that there won't be any biopsy data at ASCO. So any I guess RNAi mediated on-target efficacy won't be necessarily part of the presentation. But I'm guessing and because this is an all-comers trial that you are probably getting some patients with some baseline tumor types that are probably easier to access from a biopsy perspective than others. And so should we just be thinking about this data just coming at a later time point?
Douglas Fambrough
Yes. And we continue to guide to the yearend for us to have what I think will be a meaningful dataset. Patients add MTD, maybe some from prior MTD as well, if we ask them for biopsy as well as the biomarker data and the resist data, such that by yearend hopefully we'll be able to make a statement about proof-of-concept one way or the other.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond of Robert W. Baird.
Laura Chico
This is Laura Chico in for Chris Raymond. I think a couple my questions have already been asked. But I'd just like to circle back on PH1 a little bit, if I might, and apologies, if I missed this. Have you discussed kind of what the dose-limiting toxicity is in the mice or kind of how high you've been able to dose thus far?
Douglas Fambrough
We have not discussed any of that information. However, the deliver system that is employed in DCR-PH1 is in license from Tekmira Pharmaceuticals. And this formulation was used in their Ebola-targeted program, where they have released a fair amount of data on the toxicological findings with respect to that program that I think are a direct read over onto DCR-PH1.
Notably, in a healthy volunteer study, they were able to dose through 0.3 milligrams per kilograms without any pre-medication, and not have tolerability issues in the patients. This is a remarkable level of tolerability for a lipid nanoparticle program. Essentially all lipid-based drugs that are use today are used in conjunction with pre-medications to suppress infusion reaction.
So based on human experience with this formulation, the infusion reaction issue appears to be minimized compared to all of their lipid products for this formulation. We do expect that a dose limiting that the tolerability issues that would limit dose would be related to infusion reaction.
Laura Chico
I guess, related to PH1 and the natural history study, do you plan posting that on clinicaltrials.gov?

Douglas Fambrough
Laura, I don't know the answer to that question. It's a non-interventional study, so I'm not certain it's required. We will do it, if required. I suspect if it's not required, we won't. But in fact it's got to be a non-answer Laura, I don't actually know.
Laura Chico
I guess one last kind of high-level question. As you're thinking about the two platforms, oncology versus liver-targeted diseases, I wonder if you could opine a little bit or talk about how you're prioritizing your efforts in allocating resources between the two different franchises?
Douglas Fambrough
There's a really clear answer to that, Laura. At this point, there is great validation in the RNAi field for delivery to hepatocytes, and that gives us the confidence to invest heavily in building out the hepatocyte or liver targeted pipeline. And so almost all of our internal resources are dedicated to creating additional pipeline programs for hepatocytes targets as well as supporting the DCR-PH1 program.
The resources in oncology are best seen as being on hold. We have done I think an excellent job to creating a critical candidate with DCR-MYC that very effectively has mediated delivery to xenograft models, both orthotopically implanted and subcutaneous to genetically engineered mouse model and has more recently been shown in PDX style models.
That said, those are all mouse models, and the translation of delivery in tumors and mice to tumors and patients is one where we do not understand the differences and challenges. So while we evaluate how that translation proceeds in the DCR-MYC Phase 1 trial, we have put the allocation of resources to oncology more or less on hold.
We have developed a second clinical candidate, that's for beta-catenin, and it's essentially in a holding pattern prior to IND enabling studies. If and when we achieve the proof-of-concept with the DCR-MYC, and I described in the call today that proof-of-concept has three aspects to it, molecular evidence of knockdown of the MYC transcript, biomarker movement in reduce glucose uptake as seen by FDG-PET, and resist responses.
If we see a set of patients, where we can link those three things together or connect the dots, as I say, then Dicerna will be satisfied that we have achieved proof-of-concept. And with that we would free-up resources to move forward beta-catenin and likely invest resources in additional oncology products as well.
But until that time, and I hope that time is soon, but it's not yet. Until that time, our resource allocation is dedicated to building out the wide variety of targeted program opportunities that our liver targeted. It's also worth mentioning that all of our programs beyond PH1 for liver targets will incorporate the DsiRNA-EX Conjugate technology for subcutaneous administration.
Laura Chico
And I guess just one last quick one, and I'll hop back in the queue. I think I heard you say that you will not be collecting liver biopsies in the Phase 1 PH1 trial. Did I hear that correctly? And talk a little about the rationale for not getting the transcript data?
Douglas Fambrough
So you did hear that correctly. And the rationale is really two-fold. One is that it's really a big ask to poke someone in the liver and get a biopsy. There is risk associated with the procedure like that in addition to it being uncomfortable. The second is that while the transcript knockdown information is interesting, with respect to disease outcome it's really neither here nor there.
What we need to see in order to have an effective therapy is reduction in urinary oxalate, an evidence that we're stopping the pathway by an increasing urinary glycolate. Absenting movement in the biomarkers, it really doesn't matter what level of gene transcript reductions that we see.

So I consider it non-essential information in the trial. So for those reasons, I don't think that it's appropriate for us to ask the patients to undergo the procedure. And I think it's conceivable that IRB's wouldn't tolerate it anyway. In any event we're not making the ask.
Operator
And at this time, I am showing there are no further participants in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to management for any closing remarks.
End of Q&A
Douglas Fambrough
I want to thank everyone for their attention today. This is a very exciting time for Dicerna, as we get towards the later half of 2015 and begin to get into the clinic for DCR-PH1 as well as seeing more data out of the DCR-MYC clinical trial. So thank you all for your attention today.

Dicerna Pharmaceuticals' (DRNA) CEO Douglas Fambrough on Q3 2016 Results - Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Dicerna Pharmaceuticals' (DRNA) CEO Douglas Fambrough on Q3 2016 Results - Earnings Call TranscriptNov. 7.16 | About: Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, (DRNA) Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:DRNA)
Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call
November 7, 2016 4:30 PM ET
Executives
Melody Carey - Founder and President of Rx Communications
Douglas Fambrough - President and Chief Executive Officer
Jack Green - Chief Financial Officer
Analysts
Stephen Willey - Stifel Nicolaus
Varun Kumar - Leerink Partners
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Dicerna’s Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Ms. Melody Carey of Rx Communications Group. Ma’am, you may begin.
Melody Carey
Thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, and welcome to Dicerna’s conference call to discuss the company’s 2016 third quarter results. For anyone who has not had a chance to review our results, we issued a press release after the close of market today, which is available under the Investor media tab on our website at www.dicerna.com. You may also listen to this conference call via webcast on our website, which will also be archived for 30 days beginning approximately two hours after the call is completed.
I’d like to remind listeners that management will be making forward-looking statements on today’s call, related to the company’s future expectations, plans and prospects that constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Risk Factor section of Form 10-Q filed with the SEC today.
In addition, any forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so if our views change.
Now, I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Douglas Fambrough, Dicerna’s President and Chief Executive Officer.
Douglas Fambrough
Thank you, Melody. Good afternoon, and thanks to all of you who have joined today’s call. Today, with me is Jack Green, our Chief Financial Officer and Bob Brown, our Chief Scientific Officer.
Without a doubt, the third quarter of 2016 was a transformative one for Dicerna. Having formally rolled out our GalXC technology platform in the second quarter as a fully optimized and enabled drug discovery engine, we announced in late September, our strategic plan to focus our resources squarely on leveraging GalXC’s potential.
Our goal is to advance development of innovative subcutaneously delivered RNA interference or RNAi based pharmaceutical candidates for diseases involving the liver, such as rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and viral infectious diseases.
Given the potential power of the GalXC platform that could provide potency on par with or better than comparable platforms, as well as key benefits, including subcutaneous injectable administration, in-frequent dosing such as monthly, quarterly, and potentially even less often than that. High therapeutic index and specificity to a single target gene each of which has been previously demonstrated with GalXC compounds and silencing more than 12 different disease targets in animal models, including now more than six demonstrations in non-human primates.
Given all of these qualities of the GalXC platform, we are confident in our ability to develop a broad pipeline of GalXC product candidates with tremendous commercial prospects.

So as we transition away from our legacy programs that utilized to lipid nanoparticle-based delivery system, it bears repeating, our firm belief that leveraging our proprietary GalXC platform will allow us to retain a full or substantial ownership stake, while continuing to invest internally in indications with defined patient populations, such as certain rare diseases, which we think offer the highest probabilities of both development and commercial success.
With respect to our complex diseases, with multiple gene dysfunctions and larger patient populations, we remain in active discussions with various potential partners regarding GalXC programs in these broader therapeutic areas. The research data we have generated to-date has attracted a number of interested parties, and we will continue our due diligence with each, as appropriate, in order to find the right partner that can provide the enhanced scale, resources, and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects.
As I stated on the last call, Dicerna intends to initiate a total of three GalXC development programs this year and we are on track to achieve this goal. Moreover, at our current capacity, we can initiate three additional development programs on an annual basis going forward. As we previously reported, in addition to strong efficacy and duration profiles in animal models, GalXC has also shown a very clean safety profile, which is an important point that I want to reiterate.
As you may recall, using exaggerated pharmacology, in other words very high doses, which were many multiples higher than the expected clinical dose and given more frequently than normal, we saw zero serious adverse events, including no evidence of liver, kidney, or injection site toxicity in animal studies. This is truly exciting to see and only adds to our confidence level.
As a result, we believe that the path is clear for us to use GalXC to exploit the deep well of opportunity for RNAi-based therapies directed towards the liver. And this process is well underway. As many of you know, we have been actively examining potential disease associated targets across multiple therapeutic areas of interest. Our ability to rapidly generate GalXC inhibitors in rodents often in as little less 30 days has allowed us to quickly validate potential disease targets.
As of today we have now qualified over 30 disease associated target genes in our stated areas of focus, where we believe an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial patient benefit.
Let me now take the opportunity to review our current development programs. The first of our 2016 preclinical programs, which was launched earlier this year is DCR-PHXC for the treatment of primary hyperoxaluria or PH. As you may recall, PH is a rare inborn error of metabolism in which the liver produces excessive levels of oxalate, which results in life-threatening damage to the kidneys and other key body tissues.
Unfortunately, the current standard of care cannot stop disease progression, and as a result short of a combined liver, kidney, transplant, the majority of patients face complete renal failure by their early 20s. There is an urgency of therapeutic need for this patient population, and we are confident that the DCR-PHXC program will benefit from our prior experience with DCR-PH1, a lipid nanoparticle-based and IV administered program, which as you know, we have now discontinued and transitioned over to our GalXC-based compound.
The final decision to transition our PH program to DCR-PHXC and to discontinue DCR-PH1 was made after taking several factors into account. First, the DCR-1 human proof-of-concept data, which showed the pharmacological activity of RNAi-based therapy in PH and normal healthy volunteers and which we presented at the International Pediatric Nephrology Association Congress in late September.

Second, the utility of the subcutaneous GalXC platform, as I’ve already discussed. And finally, the totality of our encouraging DCR-PHXC preclinical data, which showed that DCR-PHXC was able to more effectively normalize oxalate production and ameliorate the disease condition of hyperoxaluria.
Together, these factors convinced us that DCR-PHXC has the potential to be a better, not just as good, but a better therapeutic candidate for this underserved patient population. I want to thank all of the patients, their families, and clinical investigators involved in the DCR-PH1 trials for their invaluable contributions. We will apply all of the lessons learned from those trials to the development of DCR-PHXC as we advance the program.
Let me also note that in line with our commitment to the PH community, we will continue to advance our primary HYperoxaluria Observational Study called PHYOS, which is collecting data on key biochemical parameters implicated in the pathogenesis of PH, which has now enrolled a total of 18 patients. We hope to leverage this data to better understand the baseline PH disease state, which will help guide our long-term development plans for DCR-PHXC.
With all of that said, our preclinical work in this program is ongoing and on track, and we intend to file an IND or CTA for DCR-PHXC in late 2017 and commence human clinical trials shortly thereafter.
Moving on to additional GalXC programs, our second 2016 GalXC program will target the PCSK9 for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a disease, which is characterized by abnormally high blood serum levels of low-density lipoproteins and which is one of the key known risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.
Our GalXC PCSK9 program is being developed for the potentially multibillion dollar statin-refractory cardiovascular disease market with a goal of improved convenience and adherence to therapy, compared to monoclonal antibodies, driven by less frequent and smaller volume dosing.
PCSK9 is already a validated target for this condition and two FDA approved therapies currently in use that are based on monoclonal antibody technology. In contrast to these, based on preclinical studies, we believe that the GalXC platform has the potential to produce a PCSK9 targeted therapy with more attractive commercial properties, including comparatively smaller subcutaneous injection volumes and less frequent dosing, while providing equal or superior control of serum cholesterol. We are continuing to advance this program and are on track to nominate a candidate for preclinical development by the end of the year.
As the hypercholesterolemia market encompasses a larger patient population and in keeping with our stated strategy, our end goal will be to partner out this particular program at a stage, where terms of a collaborative deal fairly reflects the assets value to Dicerna and its shareholders. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.
For competitive reasons, we are not yet disclosing our third 2016 GalXC-based therapeutic program. Although, I can’t say that it targets a liver express gene, which is involved in another serious rare disease with high morbidity and mortality. We have selected this disease and target gene based on a strong therapeutic hypothesis, availability of a potentially predictive biomarker, high unmet medical need, favorable competitive positioning, and what we believe may be a rapid projected path to approval. The program is on track for formal launch with an optimized lead candidate also by year end.
Concurrent with this activity, we are busy using our GalXC platform to proactively evaluate a series of additional target genes in multiple disease states across our core therapeutic areas and expect to formally initiate three additional preclinical programs in 2017, including one for chronic hepatitis B virus and two additional programs from our core therapeutic areas. As we stated in September, we aim to have a total of five programs in the clinic by the end of 2019.

Lastly as our focus has shifted and as previously announced, we have discontinued our DCR-MYC program in oncology indications. Although, clinical response and molecular knockdown was observed in preliminary data from the DCR-MYC-101 trial, the early efficacy results unfortunately did not warrant further development. It is worth noting, however, that paired tumor biopsies pre- and post-treatment showed in all cases clear evidence of RNAi-mediated MYC messenger RNA destruction in tumors from all patients tested, indicating that successful drug delivery had occurred the likely in insufficient amounts.
Data from these studies were presented at the Oligonucleotide Therapeutics Society Conference on September 28, 2016. As I hope you can tell, we are more enthusiastic than ever about the power of the GalXC platform and believe strongly, that our newly stated strategy will ultimately result in a range of highly targeted, highly effective RNAi therapies with tangible benefits that address important and urgent unmet medical needs.
As I have stated before, RNAi provides the potential to develop therapies that act by a well-understood yet previously on druggable mechanisms and which require less onerous dosing regimens, which we believe can significantly improve patient compliance and health outcomes.
I will now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Jack Green, for an update on our financial progress. Jack?
Jack Green
Thanks, Doug. I’d like to briefly summarize the key financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, and direct you to our 10-Q filing for additional details. In the third quarter of 2016, the company had a net loss of $14.2 million, or $0.68 per share, compared to a net loss of $16.9 million, or $0.82 per share for the same period of 2015.
Research and development expenses were $10.1 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $12.1 million for the same period of 2015. The year-to-year decrease was primarily due to a reduction in manufacturing and toxicology testing activities and a decrease in discovery and early development costs, as programs advanced year-over-year into clinical testing. These decreases were partially offset by an overall increase in preclinical studies for our GalXC platform, as well as an increase in clinical trial activities.
As we noted in the release, employee-related expenses, facilities, depreciation and other expenses have remained consistent year-to-year. General and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $4.3 million, as compared to $4.9 million in the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense and a reduction in other general and administrative expenses. We expect G&A expenses to increase in the future, as the company continues to expand its operating activities and incurs additional costs associated with being a public – publicly traded company.
As of September 30, 2016, we had $57.5 million in cash, cash equivalents and held-to-maturity investments, as compared to $94.6 million as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we also had $1.1 million of restricted cash on the balance sheet, which reflects collaterals securing our facility lease obligations. In the third quarter of 2016, we used $11.6 million of cash in operations.
Finally, based on our current cash position and operating plan, we continue to expect that we will have sufficient cash to fund planned operations for, at least, the next 12 months, excluding any additional partnership funding, debt or equity financings. More detail of the financial information and analysis may be found in the company’s quarterly report on form 10-Q filed with – filed today with the SEC.
I’d like now to turn the call back over to Doug.

Douglas Fambrough
Thank you, Jack. And before I turn the call over to questions, I would like to reiterate how committed we are to our focus on exploiting the full potential of our proprietary GalXC platform, which we firmly believe holds the promise of allowing us to build an exceptionally valuable pipeline over the coming years.
We remain on track to finalize the launch of two more GalXC development programs this year, as well as to identify our programs for 2017 and beyond. We’ve also generated interest in our large patient population programs from potential strategic collaborators and we will continue to pursue those opportunities. I want to thank you for your continued interest in Dicerna and for your attendance on today’s call.
With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Willey with Stifel. Your line is now open.
Stephen Willey
Yes. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was just maybe wondering, Doug, if you can comment a little bit around, I guess, how some of the, I guess, the safety concerns that have emerged with competitor programs may or may not have impacted the pace of ongoing strategic discussions?
Douglas Fambrough
Sure. I was about to say, I can’t comment on other company’s data, but that’s not really your question. We’ve been very pleased to observe that this has generated very little concern on the part of the parties that we’re in discussions with. To speculate a little bit, I think, the lack of any specific safety signal associated with [death in balance] [ph] that was reported by a peer company significantly influences that.
But there’s, although, there is a death in balance or sort of, there are to sink your teeth into. As you know, the dosing paradigm of that compound involved very high-level of drug large complex pollyanna [indiscernible] that is more than an order of magnitude, substantially more than an order of magnitude higher than the dosing levels that we anticipate and which are predictable from our non-human primate data both the amount of material and the frequency being substantially higher.
So, in short, we have not had any impact in a negative way on our discussions with respect to pace or their trajectory.
Stephen Willey
That’s helpful. Thanks for providing them. And then with respect to the ongoing PHYOS study, the Observational Study in PH1, how many of those patients that are currently enrolled in the study? Do you think will subsequently, I guess, serve as a reservoir for some of the Phase 1 development work that you’re hoping to do with PHXC?
Douglas Fambrough
I don’t think it’s possible to put a number on that. We will continue to enroll PH patients in PHYOS, and as you know, there is, at least, one other program from a competitor, a company that will be enrolling in the space, it’s certainly possible for patients and PHYOS to enroll in a competitor trial. However, one of the goals of PHYOS as you’re pointing out was to serve as a reservoir for us and with the continued enrollment, PHYOS believe, it will continue to serve that role when we reenter the clinic with the DCR-PHXC program. But I don’t think I’m in a position to quantify that.
Stephen Willey
Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.
Varun Kumar
Hi, this is Varun Kumar on behalf of Michael Schmidt. My first question is on HBV program, like the recent clinical data from other RNAi companies have been mixed in terms of viral antigen detection RNAi, can you please elaborate more on your strategy for hepatitis B program? And if you are thinking to do some preclinical work combining RNAi platform with some other agents or potential synergy?

Douglas Fambrough
It’s still pretty early days for understanding the role that RNAi will have in the treatment of chronic HBV. And some of the early clinical work that’s occurred in the field has educated, I think, everyone in the field about how to target that virus. And I can tell you, we have paid acute attention to that work and incorporated the lessons from it in our program.
With respect to the specific question about combination studies, we are an RNAi company. So we do not have potential combination of products that are in development here. But I anticipate that from a class level, we will look at the way combinations play out. But I think from a very simple perspective, one can look at a viral disease like HBV, and an analogy to other chronic viruses, you would expect combination therapy.
In that context, you could use other molecules and face the full force of the virus or you could do it in combination with RNAi and attenuate the virus by based on our current data, at least, three logs and it – it’s pretty likely that that will work better attenuated by three logs.
So, I think, independent of the exact combinations that will ultimately be determined really in clinical testing in patients, the idea that there be a role for RNAi, I think, very easily supported. So it’s really on that basis that we are working at this point primarily to optimize the activity the RNAi component itself. And we’ll have to see how things evolve. I don’t think it’s fully predictable right now.
Varun Kumar
Okay. Thank you. And just the last question, so we’ve seen a recent set back in TTR space from peer companies. How are you thinking about the TTR indication, specifically the opportunity in cardiomyopathy patient? Does that – does it change your strategy for the TTR indication?
Douglas Fambrough
So we have – we do not have an announced program in TTR. However, there clearly has been a change in the competitive landscape. It is certainly amongst that when I referred to a deep bowl of opportunities for RNAi in the liver TTR, is part of that. And I don’t think at this point, we’re in a position to talk about a strategy with respect to that target specifically one would have to consider both the competitive landscape.
And frankly, at this point, whether the type of cardiomyopathy patients who are being treated are, in fact, amenable to RNAi treatment at all, given the apparent lack of efficacy in that population, despite dosing, which should have resulted in substantial reduction in circulating TTR, though we await full look at that data.
Varun Kumar
Okay. Thank you, and thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
I’m not showing any further questions on the phone lines at this time. Dr. Fambrough, please proceed with any further remarks.
Douglas Fambrough
Well, I want to thank you for your attention today. The GalXC platform provides Dicerna with a stronger foundation than we’ve ever had for building a great company going forward, and with that, good night.
Operator
