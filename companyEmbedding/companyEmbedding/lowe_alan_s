Find Everything You Need for Your Outdoor Living
It's called the great outdoors for a reason, and Lowe's has what you need to make it even greater. From portable generators, chainsaws, riding lawn mowers and push lawn mowers, to pressure washers, trimmers, log splitters, axes and lawn aerators. When garage or interior space is running slim, expand outside with shed and outdoor storage options from Lowe's. From the strike of the match to the glow of the coals, Lowe's has what you need to be lean and mean on the grilling scene. Whether you prefer charcoal, gas or electric, enjoy slow cooking something savory in a smoker, or need a turkey fryer for the holidays, we'll help you make mealtime an event. Be the MVP of your next tailgating party with a portable grill and tips and recipes from our grill-buying guide. 
At Lowe's, we have everything you need to create a beautiful and durable deck, with treated lumber and decking or composite decking and railings. Get some R&R or entertain guests with our wide selection of bistro sets, dining sets, patio tables and patio chairs. You can also add a patio bench for seating. (Don’t forget a deck box to store your chair cushion and pillows away from the elements.) Hot tubs and spas are a wonderful addition to any outdoor deck or patio. Add patio heaters and fire pits to enjoy your new space any time of year. No matter what kind of patio you create, add a personal touch with our selection of garden and outdoor décor. Have a pool? Lowe’s carries pool maintenance tools to help you keep your pool and pool area clean. Have a green thumb? The pros at Lowe's know what it takes to make your garden grow, with plants, raised garden beds, and seeds and bulbs. Whatever your lawn needs, Lowe's gets great things growing with our selection of mulch, fertilizer, grass seed and more. Whether you're enhancing your landscape with pavers, edging stones and retaining walls, searching for the perfect fencing solution or adding a tranquil outdoor fountain or pond, our selection of lawn care and landscaping tools will keep your yard lush, green and inviting. Gazebos and canopies are also a great way to beautify your landscape. Enjoy the outdoors all year long without unwanted critters. Lowe's has all the lawn insect control, garden insect control and home insect control products you'll need to protect your space. Keep small, bothersome bugs away from you and your lawn with fire ant killers, bug sprays and mosquito repellents. We also have the products you need to protect your home with termite treatments, mousetraps and home pest control.

Let Lowe's Meet Your Grilling and Outdoor Cooking Needs
From the strike of the match to the glow of the coals, Lowe's has what you need to be lean and mean on the grilling scene. Whether you prefer charcoal, gas grills or electric grills, we’ll help you find the electric grill, gas grill or charcoal grill that’s perfect for your next party. Planning a family barbecue? We carry a wide selection of outdoor electric grills and more from Weber, Char-Broil and Broil King. Explore Weber electric BBQ, Weber charcoal BBQ and Char-Broil electric BBQ grills. Take the party on the road with a portable grill from Coleman. Need grilling supplies? We carry lump charcoal, wood chips and all the other tools you’ll need. Nothing is better than biting into something juicy and hot off the grill. Achieve perfectly grilled steak, chicken, fish or vegetables every time with an infrared grill. Be the MVP of your next tailgating party with BBQ grillware. Get tips and recipes from our Grill Buying Guide. Slow-cook something savory in a Masterbuilt smoker, sear up a storm in a Butterball turkey fryer for the holidays, or toss a homemade pie on a pizza stone and into the pizza oven. We'll help you make mealtime a delicious event. Want a complete backyard makeover? Remember to check out our garden center and landscaping supplies to see what else you can do.
