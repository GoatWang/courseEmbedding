You have to have a meritocracy so those that are political and those that work in cliques  —  that needs to be discouraged. The other thing is to be honest with employees.

That way, they know what you’re expecting, they know what to do, and it makes their life at work a lot happier.”  —  Jonathan E. Johnson III
