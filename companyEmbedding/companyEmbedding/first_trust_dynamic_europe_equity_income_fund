First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund Declares Its Monthly Common Share Distribution Of $0.121 Per Share For July And A Quarterly Special Distribution Of $0.235 Per Share






Business Wire




Jun 20, 2017 5:26 PM EDT













 


















































  First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FDEU) has declared the Fund's regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution in the amount of $0.121 per share and an additional special distribution of $0.235 per share payable on July 17, 2017, to shareholders of record as of July 6, 2017. The ex-dividend date is expected to be July 3, 2017. The monthly distribution information for the Fund appears below.      First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (FDEU):     Distribution per share:           $0.121     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 NAV of $19.90:       7.30%     Distribution Rate based on the June 19, 2017 closing market price of $19.40:       7.48%                  The majority, and possibly all, of the monthly common share distribution will be paid out of net investment income earned by the Fund. A portion of this distribution may come from net short-term realized capital gains and/or return of capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in 2017 will be made after the end of 2017 and will be provided on Form 1099-DIV.  In addition to the regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution, the Fund has declared a quarterly special distribution. The quarterly special distribution is equal to 50% of the amount by which the NAV of the Fund as of the quarterly special distribution measurement date (the "measurement NAV"), which was June 15, 2017, exceeds the NAV of the Fund as of the most recent prior quarterly special distribution measurement date for which a quarterly special distribution was paid (the "benchmark NAV"). Since the Fund's inception date on September 24, 2015, a quarterly special distribution has not been paid by the Fund as the measurement NAV has not exceeded the benchmark NAV on the special distribution measurement date prior to this quarter's measurement date. Therefore, the benchmark NAV is the Fund's inception NAV adjusted for estimated offering costs. The calculation of the measurement NAV and the benchmark NAV has been appropriately adjusted to reflect the regularly scheduled monthly common share distribution declared June 20, 2017. For the purposes of the next quarterly special distribution, the benchmark NAV will be $19.294 per share.

First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (FDEU)




Fund Summary|News & Literature|Historical Pricing|Distribution History|Contact Fund











Investment Objective/Strategy - First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (the "Fund") is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund's investment objective is to provide a high level of current income with a secondary focus on capital appreciation. Under normal market conditions, the Fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its Managed Assets in a portfolio of equity securities of European companies of any market capitalization, including, but not limited to, common and preferred stock that pay dividends, depositary receipts and real estate investment trusts. The Fund will seek to focus its equity investments on income producing securities. The Fund will utilize a dynamic currency hedging process, which will include, at the discretion of the portfolio managers, the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the Fund's currency exposure. To generate additional income, the Fund currently expects to write (or sell) call options on portfolio equity securities and certain broad-based securities indices in an amount up to 40% of the value of its Managed Assets.


        There can be no assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved.

Footnotes


1
The NAV represents the fund's net assets (assets less liabilities) divided by the fund's common shares outstanding.


2
Fund shares are purchased and sold on an exchange at their share price rather than net asset value (NAV), which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than NAV (premium) or less than NAV (discount).


3
Most recent distribution paid or declared to today's date. Subject to change in the future. There is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends.


4
Distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through today's date and then dividing by the most recent market price. The distribution consists of the sum of net investment income, net realized short-term capital gains, net realized long-term capital gains, and return of capital.  Distribution rates may vary. Any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration date for the next distribution.  See the fund's 19a-1 Notices, if any, located under the "News & Literature" section of the website for estimates of distribution sources. Final determination of the source and tax status of all distributions paid in the current year will be made after year-end.


5
Total return is the combination of reinvested dividend income and reinvested capital gains distributions, at prices obtained by the Dividend Reinvestment Plan, if any, and changes in the NAV and Share Price.  The NAV total return takes into account the fund's total annual expenses and does not reflect sales load.  Past performance is not indicative of future results.


6
Leverage is a technique where a closed-end fund's manager borrows assets at one rate and invests the proceeds from the borrowed assets at another rate, seeking to increase yield and total return. Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


7
Market value information used in calculating the percentages is based upon trade date plus one recording of transactions, which can differ from regulatory financial reports (Forms N-CSR and N-Q) that are based on trade date recording of security transactions. Holdings are subject to change.

Risk Considerations


    The fund is subject to risks, including the fact that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company. Investment return and market value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. Shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
   

    Because the fund will invest primarily in securities of non-U.S issuers, which are generally denominated in non-U.S. currencies, there are risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. issuers. Non-U.S. issuers are subject to higher volatility than securities of U.S. issuers. An investor may lose money if the local currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.


    Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of investing in emerging markets securities.


    The fund will engage in practices and strategies that will result in exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, thus subjecting it to foreign currency risk.


    The fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they had not been used, may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell.


    Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify the effect of any losses.


    The risks of investing in the fund are spelled out in the prospectus, shareholder report and other regulatory filings.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund Declares its Monthly Common Share Distribution of $0.121 Per Share for August | Business Wire
























































First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund Declares its Monthly 
      Common Share Distribution of $0.121 Per Share for August






July 20, 2017 04:56 PM Eastern Daylight Time



WHEATON, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income Fund (the "Fund") (NYSE: FDEU) 
      has declared the Fund’s regularly scheduled monthly common share 
      distribution in the amount of $0.121 per share payable on August 15, 
      2017, to shareholders of record as of August 3, 2017. The ex-dividend 
      date is expected to be August 1, 2017. The monthly distribution 
      information for the Fund appears below.
    




First Trust Dynamic Europe Equity Income 
            Fund (FDEU):



           
        





          Distribution per share:
        



          $0.121
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 NAV of $19.63:
        



          7.40%
        



          Distribution Rate based on the July 19, 2017 closing market price of 
          $18.99:
        



          7.65%
        



      The majority, and possibly all, of this distribution will be paid out of 
      net investment income earned by the Fund. A portion of this distribution 
      may come from net short-term realized capital gains and/or return of 
      capital. The final determination of the source and tax status of all 
      distributions paid in 2017 will be made after the end of 2017 and will 
      be provided on Form 1099-DIV.
    

      The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company 
      that seeks to provide a high level of current income. As a secondary 
      objective, the Fund seeks to focus on capital appreciation. The Fund 
      will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% 
      of its Managed Assets in a portfolio of equity securities of European 
      companies of any market capitalization, including, but not limited to, 
      common and preferred stocks that pay dividends, depositary receipts and 
      real estate investment trusts. The Fund will seek to focus its equity 
      investments on income-producing securities. The Fund will also seek to 
      utilize a dynamic currency hedging process, which will include, at the 
      discretion of the portfolio managers, the use of forward foreign 
      currency exchange contracts to hedge a portion of the Fund's currency 
      exposure. To generate additional income, the Fund will write (or sell) 
      call options on portfolio equity securities and certain broad-based 
      securities indices in an amount up to 40% of the value of its Managed 
      Assets.
    

      First Trust Advisors L.P., the Fund's investment advisor, along with its 
      affiliate, First Trust Portfolios L.P., are privately-held companies 
      which provide a variety of investment services, including asset 
      management and financial advisory services, with collective assets under 
      management or supervision of approximately $107 billion as of June 30, 
      2017 through unit investment trusts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end 
      funds, mutual funds and separate managed accounts.
    

      Henderson Global Investors (North America) Inc. ("Henderson") serves as 
      the Fund's investment sub-advisor. Henderson is an indirect, 
      wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus Henderson Group plc ("Janus Henderson 
      Group", d/b/a Janus Henderson Investors). Janus Henderson Investors is 
      headquartered in London and is a global investment management firm that 
      provides a full spectrum of investment products and services to clients 
      around the world. Janus Henderson Investors was formed as a result of a 
      “merger of equals” on May 30, 2017 in which Henderson Group plc and 
      Janus Capital Group Inc. combined their operations to form a new active 
      management firm that – together – builds on the strengths and 
      capabilities of their respective organizations. Henderson Investment 
      Management Limited, a registered investment adviser and an indirect, 
      wholly-owned subsidiary of Janus Henderson Group, serves as the Fund’s 
      sub-sub-advisor responsible for certain investment decisions of the 
      Fund. With offices in 27 cities with more than 2,000 employees, Janus 
      Henderson Investors managed approximately $331 billion in assets as of 
      May 30, 2017.
    

      Past performance is no assurance of future results. Investment return 
      and market value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate. Shares, 
      when sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
    

      Principal Risk Factors: The Fund is subject to risks, including the fact 
      that it is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company.
    

      Because the Fund will invest primarily in securities of non-U.S. 
      issuers, which are generally denominated in non-U.S. currencies, there 
      are risks not typically associated with investing in securities of U.S. 
      issuers. Non-U.S. issuers are subject to higher volatility than 
      securities of U.S. issuers. An investor may lose money if the local 
      currency of a non-U.S. market depreciates against the U.S. dollar.
    

      Investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market 
      countries are considered speculative and there is a heightened risk of 
      investing in emerging markets securities.
    

      The Fund will engage in practices and strategies that will result in 
      exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, thus subjecting it 
      to foreign currency risk.
    

      The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses greater than if they 
      had not been used, may require the Fund to sell or purchase portfolio 
      securities at inopportune times, may limit the amount of appreciation 
      the Fund can realize on an investment, or may cause the Fund to hold a 
      security that it might otherwise sell.
    

      Use of leverage can result in additional risk and cost, and can magnify 
      the effect of any losses.
    

      The risks of investing in the Fund are spelled out in the shareholder 
      reports and other regulatory filings.
    

      The Fund’s daily closing New York Stock Exchange price and net asset 
      value per share as well as other information can be found at www.ftportfolios.com 
      or by calling 1-800-988-5891.
