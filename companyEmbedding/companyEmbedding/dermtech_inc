DermTech Selected as a Finalist for CONNECT’s 28th Annual Most 
      Innovative New Product Awards

September 30, 2015 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today, DermTech, Inc., a privately held dermatology company 
      commercializing non-invasive gene expression tests for skin cancer, 
      announced that its Pigmented Lesion Assay has been selected as a 
      finalist in CONNECT’s 
      Most Innovative New Product Awards. CONNECT, a premier innovation 
      company accelerator in San Diego that creates and scales great companies 
      in the technology and life sciences sectors, continues its twenty-eight 
      year tradition of celebrating innovation leaders in the local San Diego 
      community.
    


      The Pigmented Lesion Assay helps clinicians non-invasively assess 
      atypical pigmented lesions (often referred to as moles) for melanoma. 
      The test measures the expression of 2 genes known to be upregulated in 
      melanoma skin cancer. DermTech’s Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) provides 
      physicians with non-invasively obtained gene expression information for 
      clinically atypical pigmented skin lesions. The PLA MAGE (Melanoma 
      Associated Gene Expression) detects the presence or absence of 
      expression for two specific genes, PRAME and LINC00518, and is used as 
      the primary profile assessment. These two genes belong to separate 
      classes of molecules that are known to have roles in oncogenesis, and 
      both are elevated in melanoma. The Pigmented Lesion Assay utilizes a 
      sample collected with our Adhesive Patch Skin Biopsy Kit, and can be 
      used to reduce unnecessary surgical biopsy procedures by ruling out 
      false positives based on visual assessment prior to performing a 
      surgical removal. It may also be used to provide immediate information 
      on lesions that typically require 6-12 months of follow up for change. 
      This non-invasive biopsy approach has additional utility in patient 
      populations that are anti-coagulated, at increased risk for infection 
      and scarring, or at risk for wound complications, and for lesions in 
      cosmetically sensitive areas.
    

      "We are pleased that the first commercial product derived from our 
      platform technology gives physicians the ability to better assess 
      pigmented skin lesions including melanoma while reducing overall cost. 
      Feedback from both dermatologists and patients on this non-invasive and 
      highly accurate gene expression test has been very positive," said Dr. 
      John Dobak, DermTech’s CEO and President.
    

      Winners were selected from the following eight categories: Aerospace, 
      Security & Cyber Technologies, Cleantech, Communications & IT, Life 
      Science Diagnostics & Research Tools, Mobile Apps, Pharmaceutical Drugs 
      & Medical Devices, Software & Digital Media and Sport & Active Lifestyle 
      Technologies. Each of the winners will be recognized on the evening of 
      December 1 at the 2015 Most Innovative New Product Awards presentation 
      and dinner, to be held at Hyatt Regency La Jolla at Aventine, 3777 La 
      Jolla Village Drive, San Diego, CA 92122.
    

      For a complete list of winners and additional information, please visit 
      the Most 
      Innovative New Product Awards Website.

DermTech, Inc. Key Developments

DermTech, Inc. Announces First Payor Contract with CareFirst
Jun 12 17
DermTech, Inc. announced that the company has become a Participating Provider with CareFirst Blue Cross/Blue Shield and CareFirst BlueChoice (CareFirst) healthcare insurers for the Pigmented Lesion Assay, the company's non-invasive biopsy and gene expression test for the detection of melanoma. The agreement establishes coverage for CareFirst. Coverage is scheduled to become effective for claims for services performed on or after June 1, 2017.


DermTech, Inc. Announces Validation Study Publication
Oct 5 16
DermTech, Inc. announced the publication of the "Development and Validation of a Non-Invasive 2-Gene Molecular Assay for Cutaneous Melanoma", in theJournal of the American Academy of Dermatology(Ms.No. JAAD-D-16-00647R1). This validation study sought to provide clinicians with a differentiated and accurate noninvasive diagnostic modality. A 2-gene classification method based on LINC00518 and preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma gene expression (PRAME) was evaluated and validated in 555 pigmented lesions (157 training and 398 validation samples) obtained noninvasively via adhesive patch biopsy. Results were compared with standard histopathologic assessment in lesions with a consensus diagnosis among 3 experienced dermatopathologists. In 398 validation samples, LINC00518 and/or PRAME detection appropriately differentiated melanoma from non-melanoma samples with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 69%. LINC00518 and PRAME were established in both melanoma samples obtained via non-invasive adhesive patch biopsy and underlying FFPE samples of surgically excised primary melanomas and in melanoma lymph node metastases. This newly published validation study demonstrates how non-invasive pigmented lesion assay classifies clinically difficult to differentiate pigmented lesions into melanoma and non-melanoma groups. It offers dermatologists a tool to help with diagnostic challenges that may be inherently linked to the visual image and pattern recognition approach.


DermTech, Inc. Names Mr. Matthew Posard to the Board of Directors
Jul 11 16
DermTech, Inc. announced it has added Mr. Matthew Posard to its board of directors. Additionally, the company announced the continued expansion of its commercial team with regional sales personnel.

						 from   DermTech, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


SAN DIEGO, Dec. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, DermTech, Inc., a privately held commercial stage molecular diagnostic company developing gene expression tests for skin cancer, announced the release of its new website (www.dermtech.com), designed to provide education and information to both physicians and patients about DermTech's platform technology and first product, the Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) and non-invasive adhesive skin biopsy used to aid in the diagnosis of melanoma. DermTech is the first to offer gene expression tests directly to the physician to aid in diagnosis with specimens collected using an adhesive patch, rather than a scalpel.
"We are excited to introduce this new website which accurately reflects the high tech, innovative nature of our company and highlights the benefits of non-invasively obtained gene expression data to both the physician and concerned patients. The website details the benefits of our non-invasive adhesive biopsy and PLA test in aiding in the detection of melanoma, as well DermTech's unique platform technology that can be used as a stand alone diagnostic or diagnostic aid, or to support clinical drug development. This new website will further support the expansion of our commercial activities," said Sarah Dennison, Vice President of Marketing.
ABOUT DermTech
DermTech is a commercial stage molecular dermatology company developing non-invasive gene expression tests to aid the clinical diagnosis of skin cancer and other skin conditions.  DermTech operates a CLIA licensed laboratory located in the company's La Jolla, CA headquarters. DermTech's technology allows the analysis of skin biopsy samples collected non-invasively using an adhesive patch. DermTech provides highly accurate, objective information to physicians to improve care and reduce costs. Current dermatologic diagnosis is primarily based on subjective visual pattern recognition that is prone to error and results in a substantial number of unnecessary surgical procedures.  For additional information visit: www.dermtech.com.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $     million, or approximately $     million if the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, assuming an initial public
offering price of $     per share, the midpoint of the price range listed on the
cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each
$1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$     per share would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this
offering by approximately $     million, or approximately $     million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, assuming the number
of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus,
remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of the offering as follows:

• approximately $     million to hire sales and marketing personnel and     
  support increased sales and marketing activities;                         

• approximately $     million to fund further research and development,     
  clinical utility studies, and future enhancements of our current test;    

• approximately $     million to fund research and development and clinical 
  studies for our planned products;                                         

• approximately $     million to acquire equipment, implement automation,   
  and scale our capabilities to prepare for significant test volume; and    

• the balance for general corporate purposes and to fund ongoing operations 
  and the expansion of our business.                                        

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plan and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering. We
will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds in the
category of “for general corporate purposes and to fund ongoing operations and
the expansion of our business,” and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. For example, if we
identify opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our
stockholders, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire, invest in, or license complementary products, technologies, or
businesses although we have no current commitments, understandings, or
agreements to do so.


The molecular diagnostics market is highly competitive. We compete with a number
of manufacturers and distributors of molecular diagnostic tests as well as new
and traditional medical devices and other technologies that are used to assist
physicians with the diagnosis of melanoma and other diseases by testing and
analyzing skin tissue samples. In the area of melanoma, Myriad Genetics, Inc., 
recently launched a gene expression assay as a validated CLIA laboratory test 
for surgical biopsy specimens. MELA Sciences, Inc. markets a device that 
utilizes varying wavelengths to capture lesion images at different depths and 
algorithmic image analysis to determine the degree of lesion disorganization 
and the need for biopsy. SciBase AB is marketing an epidermal electrical 
impedance spectrometer to diagnose melanoma in Europe and Australia. Verisante 
Technology, Inc. has received regulatory approval in Europe and Australia to 
market a device that uses real-time Raman spectroscopy to assess changes in 
the chemical composition of skin tissue. Welch-Allen, Inc. and various others 
manufacture dermatoscopes, which provide magnified views of a pigmented lesion
during diagnosis. Of the devices mentioned above, we believe that only the 
MELA Sciences, Inc. device has received FDA approval. While FDA approval is 
an important factor considered by physicians when evaluating a technology, we
believe that factors such as accuracy, cost and ease of use are also given
significant weight.


Company Description
We are an emerging growth diagnostics company developing and marketing novel
non-invasive gene expression tests to aid in the diagnosis of various skin
conditions, including skin cancer, inflammatory diseases, and aging-related
conditions. Our technology provides a highly accurate alternative to


 surgical
biopsy, eliminating patient pain, scarring, and risk of infection, while
maximizing convenience. Our scalable gene expression assays have been designed
to work with a proprietary “adhesive patch biopsy” that provides a tissue sample
non-invasively. Current dermatologic diagnosis is primarily based on subjective
visual pattern recognition that is prone to error and results in a substantial
number of unnecessary surgical biopsies.

We analyze the skin cells taken from the patient using our adhesive patch with a
proprietary process that allows us to extract ribonucleic acid, or RNA, from the
patch with sufficient quality and quantity to run our gene expression analysis.
Our quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or qPCR, tests provide objective,
biology-based information that is highly accurate and can significantly reduce
unnecessary surgical biopsies. We offer our gene expression tests through our
6,000 square foot state-of-the-art government-licensed laboratory located in our
company headquarters. We believe we will be the first company to offer a
non-invasive gene expression test to the clinical dermatology market, which is
in contrast to the vast majority of molecular diagnostic tests that are sold
into the highly saturated pathology and oncology markets.

We are initially commercializing tests that will address unmet needs in the
diagnostic pathway of pigmented skin lesions, such as moles or dark colored skin
spots. Our products are designed to facilitate the clinical assessment of
pigmented skin lesions for melanoma, aid the histopathologic staging of
melanoma, and determine the metastatic potential of melanoma. Our first product
in this area is the Pigmented Lesion Assay, which can be used to reduce
unnecessary surgical biopsy procedures by ruling out false positives based on
visual assessment prior to performing a surgical biopsy. The development of our
Pigmented Lesion Assay has involved over 500 lesion samples, including over 250
melanomas. We have completed the development of our Pigmented Lesion Assay and
plan to introduce our product in the second half of 2014. We plan to initially
market this test directly to a concentrated group of 250 to 500 dermatologists
that treat a majority of the 750,000 patients with the highest risk of melanoma
in the United States. While we have not yet generated any sales from our
Pigmented Lesion Assay, and have a history of net losses of $40.6 million since
our inception. We have begun generating revenue of $31,000 from our sample
collection kits and CLIA testing services during the first quarter of 2014
through research collaborations with Biogen Idec and others.

Over the next three years, we also plan to commercialize additional solutions in
skin cancer and pursue additional partnering and licensing opportunities for our
platform technology in areas such, inflammatory skin diseases,
aesthetic/cosmetic indications, and acne. We have developed proof-of-concept
tests and gene expression profiles and classifiers in some of these areas that
demonstrate the potential utility of our technology. These opportunities involve
clinical trial support and can produce revenue from sample processing. In
addition, they may lead to companion diagnostic products for new or existing
drug therapies. We have begun recognizing revenue with customers who purchase
our sample collection kits and CLIA testing services.

Our proposed products have been validated as Laboratory Developed Tests, or
LDTs, for use in our laboratory, which has been certified under the Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA. Our sample collection kit is
a Class I medical device that is manufactured by a supplier approved by the Food
and Drug Administration, or FDA. Our validation studies have been performed
under Quality System Regulations, or QSR, standards. Our current plans are to
launch our assay as an LDT in our CLIA laboratory. There is uncertainty
surrounding the regulatory path for new healthcare technologies, and if the FDA
required us to submit our product for pre-market approval or 510K clearance,
there would be significant delays in our product launch and our ability to
generate revenue, while we would incur additional costs for clinical trials and
related expenses. The FDA indicated that it is reviewing the regulatory
requirements that apply to LDTs. In July 2010, the FDA held a two-day public
meeting to obtain input from stakeholders on how it should apply its authority
to implement a reasonable, risk-based, and effective regulatory framework for
LDTs, including genetic tests. However, the FDA has not yet issued the
additional guidance, and they do not have such guidance in their current fiscal
year goals, but may generate such guidance in the future.
