	SUMMIT THERAPEUTICS REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER ENDED 30 APRIL 2016 AND OPERATIONAL PROGRESS




	Oxford, UK, 2 June 2016

	 Summit Therapeutics plc (AIM: SUMM, NASDAQ: SMMT), the drug discovery and development company advancing therapies
	for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) and

	C. difficile

	infection (CDI), today reports its financial results for the first quarter ended 30 April 2016.





	Mr Glyn Edwards, Chief Executive Officer of Summit commented



	:

	Our programmes in DMD and CDI both have the potential to
	significantly improve the current standards of care and are making good progress towards the patients who could benefit from their unique mechanisms of action. With the IND clearance for the expansion of PhaseOut DMD into the US, we are on track to
	announce initial data that could potentially demonstrate the mechanism of ezutromid and utrophin modulation in patients with DMD in January 2017.




	In CDI, data from our Phase 2 CoDIFy trial continue to support ridinilazole as a novel, highly selective antibiotic that could greatly reduce
	recurrent disease. As this programme advances to Phase 3, we are exploring potential partnerships to leverage the most value for patients, shareholders and our Company.

	OPERATIONAL REVIEW



	Summit is seeking to treat all patients affected with the fatal disorder DMD using its utrophin modulation technology. Summit is also advancing a highly
	selective antibiotic to treat CDI.


	Summits DMD utrophin modulation programme is a treatment approach independent of the underlying mutations in the
	dystrophin gene that cause the disease. Therefore, this approach has the potential to benefit the entire patient population. Summit has established a leadership position in the field of utrophin modulation and is developing a pipeline of first,
	second and future generation product candidates. Summits most advanced utrophin modulator is ezutromid. It is an orally administered small molecule that is being evaluated in patient clinical trials. Ezutromid has received orphan drug
	designation in the United States and Europe.


	Summits CDI therapy is ridinilazole, a novel class antibiotic that has the potential to treat the
	initial infection and reduce recurrent disease, the key clinical issue in CDI. In the recent Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial, ridinilazole markedly reduced recurrence rates and had a statistically superior rate of sustained clinical response
	(SCR) compared to vancomycin. Ridinilazole is now being prepared for Phase 3 clinical trials. Ridinilazole has received Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, designation and has been granted Fast Track designation by the US Food
	and Drug Administration (FDA).



	Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Utrophin Modulation Programme




	Ezutromid: Phase 2 Proof of Concept Trial



	Ezutromid is
	progressing into an open label Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial. The 48-week open-label trial, called PhaseOut DMD, is expected to enrol up to 40 boys ranging in age from their fifth to their tenth birthdays. PhaseOut DMD aims to provide
	proof of concept for ezutromid and utrophin modulation through measurements of muscle fat infiltration, as well as through measurements of utrophin protein and muscle fibre regeneration in muscle biopsies. A primary endpoint of the trial is the
	change from baseline in magnetic resonance imaging parameters related to fat infiltration and inflammation of the leg muscles. Functional endpoints, including the six-minute walk test, North Star Ambulatory Assessment and patient reported outcomes,
	are also being explored.


	Summit expects to commence enrolment and dosing of patients in PhaseOut DMD at trial sites in the United Kingdom during the
	second quarter of 2016. In late April 2016, the FDA cleared the investigational new drug application for ezutromid and enrolment into PhaseOut DMD at trial sites in the United States is expected to start during the third quarter of 2016. The Company
	anticipates reporting data periodically during this trial with 24-week muscle biopsy data from the first group of patients enrolled expected to be reported in January 2017.



	Ezutromid: Phase 1 New Formulation Trial



	In addition to
	the current clinical development of ezutromid, Summit is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial in heathy volunteers and patients with DMD to evaluate two potential optimised formulations of ezutromid. Interim data from this trial were reported in
	March 2016.


	The two new formulations were tested in healthy volunteers with one of these achieving an over ten-fold increase in blood plasma levels
	compared to the current formulation of ezutromid. This formulation is now being evaluated in patients with DMD. Data from the initial dosing period showed all patients achieved drug levels within the range believed to be necessary for potential
	therapeutic benefit. The initial dose tested was one tenth of that required with the current formulation to achieve similar drug concentration levels as those observed in the Phase 1b modified diet clinical trial. The Phase 1 new formulation trial
	is now testing a higher dose of the new formulation, and firm decisions on the further development of this new formulation will await full data from the trial which are expected in the third quarter of 2016.



	Utrophin Modulator Pipeline and Biomarker Development



	As
	part of the Companys strategy to maintain its leadership position in the field of utrophin modulation, Summit is advancing a pipeline of second and future generation utrophin modulators. The second generation molecules are structurally related
	to ezutromid, but are designed to have more favourable pharmaceutical properties to achieve higher plasma levels of drug. Future generation molecules will likely be structurally distinct from ezutromid and second-generation molecules.





	In March 2016, research was published in the peer reviewed journal

	PLoS ONE

	on the development of imaging
	techniques designed to quantify utrophin protein and muscle fibre regeneration in muscle biopsies from patients with DMD and Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), a milder form of muscular dystrophy. The developed assays allowed the absolute
	quantification of regenerating muscle fibres within a biopsy section and, for the first time, the researchers observed a correlation between the percentage of regenerating muscle fibres with differences in clinical severity between patients with DMD
	and BMD from whom the biopsy was taken.



	Utrophin R&D Day



	Summit will host a Utrophin R&D Day on 15 June 2016 in New York City. The event is open to analysts, institutional investors and members of the press
	and will feature presentations from three key opinion leaders in DMD alongside management. For more information, email

	C. difficile



	Infection Programme




	Phase 2 CoDIFy Clinical Trial



	During the first quarter of
	the fiscal year, further data were reported from a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial of ridinilazole called CoDIFy. CoDIFy was a double-blind, randomised active-control trial evaluating the efficacy of ridinilazole against the current standard
	of care, the antibiotic vancomycin. CoDIFy enrolled 100 patients with half the patients receiving ten days of dosing with ridinilazole (200mg, twice a day), and half the patients receiving ten days of dosing with vancomycin (125mg, four times a
	day). The trial was conducted in the United States and Canada.


	CoDIFy met its primary endpoint with ridinilazole achieving a SCR rate of 66.7% compared
	to 42.4% for vancomycin (non-inferiority margin of 15%, p=0.0004). This also represented statistical superiority of ridinilazole over vancomycin using the pre-specified 90% confidence interval. SCR was defined as clinical cure based on the
	resolution of diarrhoea at the end of treatment and no recurrence of CDI within 30 days after the end of treatment. The difference in SCR was driven by a reduction in disease recurrence with ridinilazole having a recurrence rate of 14.3% compared to
	34.8% with vancomycin. Cure rates at the end of treatment were 77.8% for ridinilazole compared to 69.7% for vancomycin.


	In addition, preliminary analysis
	of microbiome data from CoDIFy showed ridinilazole to be highly preserving of the gut microbiome. Patients treated with ridinilazole in CoDIFy exhibited no further damage to their microbiome during therapy with a proportion of patients showing
	initial evidence of recovery of key bacterial groups that play a role in protecting from CDI. In contrast, patients treated with vancomycin suffered substantial damage to their gut microbiome during treatment and this persisted in many patients
	during the 30-day post treatment period.


	In CoDIFy, ridinilazole was generally well tolerated and the overall adverse event profiles of ridinilazole and
	vancomycin were comparable. This primary analysis was conducted on the modified intent-to-treat, or mITT, population that comprised patients with CDI confirmed by the presence of free toxin and these results were consistent across all treatment
	groups. Additional data from this trial are to be reported at the 2016 ASM Microbe conference which will be held June 16-20 in Boston, US.


	In light
	of these positive data from CoDIFy, the Company is exploring options for the future development of ridinilazole, although the preference is to find a partner to advance ridinilazole to Phase 3 through commercialisation.


	An exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating ridinilazole against the antibiotic fidaxomicin is currently ongoing in Europe and the US. The results from
	this open label trial are expected to help inform the design of future Phase 3 clinical trials and the commercial positioning of ridinilazole. Top-line results from this trial are expected in the second half of 2016.






	Preclinical Activities



	In February 2016, data published in the

	Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy

	reported that ridinilazole outperformed the current standards of care,
	vancomycin and metronidazole, in preclinical studies by having a robust killing effect on

	C. difficile

	that significantly reduced the level of toxins produced by the bacteria that play a major role in driving the symptoms and severity of the
	disease.



	Patent Grant



	A composition of matter
	patent covering ridinilazole was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in April 2016. The patent (United States Patent 9,314,456) is entitled Antibacterial Compounds and provides a period of exclusivity for
	ridinilazole in the United States until at least 1 December 2029, with the possibility of patent term extension.


	The development of ridinilazole has
	been financially supported by Seeding Drug Discovery and Translational Awards from the Wellcome Trust.



	FINANCIAL REVIEW




	Other Operating Income



	Other operating income for the
	three months ended 30 April 2016 was £0.06 million compared to £0.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015. Income recognised as part of the Wellcome Trust Translational Award decreased by
	£0.2 million to £650 for the three months ended 30 April 2016 from £0.2 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015. As of 30 April 2016, we had an accrued income balance of £0.1 million
	related to cash due to be received from the Wellcome Trust, which we expect to receive within the next twelve months upon achievement of the final milestone of the Wellcome Trust Award when we deliver final reports related to the grant. Income
	recognized as part of the funding from Innovate UK for the DMD programme decreased by £0.1 million to £0.06 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016 from £0.2 million for the three months ended
	30 April 2015. The decrease in income is in line with the achievement of milestones to date under the funding agreement.



	Operating Expenses




	Research and Development Expenses



	Research and
	development expenses increased by £1.7 million to £4.8 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016 from £3.1 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015. This increase was primarily due to
	increased investment in our DMD programme which increased by £1.1 million to £2.3 million from £1.2 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015, and a £0.6 million increase in research and
	development related staffing costs driven by an increase in headcount.



	General and Administration Expenses



	General and administration expenses increased by £0.3 million to £1.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016 from
	£1.1 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015. This increase was primarily due to additional corporate costs of £0.3 million associated with being a publicly traded company in the United States as well as in the
	United Kingdom and a £0.2 million increase in staff related costs offset by a £0.2 million favourable exchange rate variance.



	Cash Flows




	Operating Activities



	Net cash used by operating activities increased by £2.5 million to £6.4 million for the three months ended 30 April 2016 compared to
	£3.9 million for the three months ended 30 April 2015. This increase was driven by an increase in research and development expenditure and an increase in working capital requirements of £0.3 million.



	Investing Activities



	Net cash used in investing
	activities for the three months ended 30 April 2016 and the three months ended 30 April 2015 includes the net amount of bank interest received on cash deposits less amounts paid to acquire property, plant and equipment.






	Financing Activities



	Net cash inflow from financing activities for the three months ended 30 April 2016 relates to proceeds of £0.1 million received following the
	exercise of warrants on 14 April 2016. For the three months ended 30 April 2015 the Company received net proceeds of £22.0 million from the sale of equity securities.



	Headcount



	Average headcount for the three months ended
	30 April 2016 was 37 (30 April 2015: 25).



	Financial Position



	As at 30 April 2016, total cash and cash equivalents held were £10.0 million (31 January 2016: £16.3 million)

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



	For the three months ended 30 April 2016



	1. Basis of
	accounting



	The unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of Summit and its subsidiaries (the Group) for the three months ended
	30 April 2016 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations as issued by the
	International Accounting Standards Board and as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS including those applicable to accounting periods ending 31 January 2017
	and the accounting policies set out in Summits consolidated financial statements. They do not include all the statements required for full annual financial statements, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
	statements of the Group as at 31 January 2016 (the 2016 Accounts). The 2016 Accounts, on which the Companys auditors delivered an unqualified audit report, will be delivered to the Register of Companies following the 2016
	Annual General Meeting. The 2016 Accounts also contain a statement from the auditors drawing shareholders attention to the Groups need to raise additional capital as noted below.


	The interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention. Whilst the financial information included in this
	announcement has been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and adopted for use in the European Union, this announcement does not itself contain sufficient information to comply with IFRSs.


	The interim financial statements have been prepared assuming the Group will continue on a going concern basis. Based on management forecasts, the Groups
	existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to enable the Group to fund the operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for its major programmes up until 31 January 2017. The Group therefore needs to raise additional
	capital to continue to fund its future operations, which may come from a public or private fund raising, though there can be no assurance that the Group will be able to generate funds in this manner, on terms acceptable to the Group, on a timely
	basis or at all, which would impact the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.


	The financial information for the three month periods ended
	30 April 2016 and 2015 is unaudited.


	Solely for the convenience of the reader, unless otherwise indicated, all pound sterling amounts stated in the
	Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 30 April 2016 and in the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the three months ended 30 April 2016 have been translated into US dollars at the rate on 30 April 2016 of
	$1.4666 to £1.00. These translations should not be considered representations that any such amounts have been, could have been or could be converted into US dollars at that or any other exchange rate as at that or any other date.


	The Board of Directors of the Company approved this statement on 2 June 2016.



	2. Loss per share calculation



	The loss per Ordinary
	Share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the period by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the three month period to 30 April 2016: 61,324,182 (for the three month period to 30 April 2015: 52,391,028).


	Since the Group has reported a net loss, diluted loss per Ordinary Share is equal to basic loss per Ordinary Share.



	3. Issue of share capital



	On 14 April 2016, the
	number of Ordinary Shares increased to 61,467,785 following the exercise of warrants over 177,045 Ordinary Shares at an exercise price of 60 pence per share. The issue of shares raised net proceeds of £106,227. All new Ordinary Shares rank

	pari passu

	with existing Ordinary Shares.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this

the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Anna Varlamova, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Ms. Varlamova’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non-binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board and/or OTC Link when and if our
common stocks become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board
and/or OTC Link. Ms. Varlamova will not be paid any compensation or anything
from the proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of
the funds advanced by Ms. Varlamova. Ms. Varlamova will be repaid from revenues
of operations if and when we generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation.


Currently, the market of consulting services in Thailand is quite actively
developed. Presently, there are many companies that render similar services. We
estimate the market of business consulting service in Thailand as low
development market. We believe that the market has potential of growth
especially for foreign investments. There are many companies which provide
similar service separately (investment brokers, lawyers etc). However, in our
personal estimation, there are lack of companies that offer complex of
consulting service. We see our competitive advantages in complex of consulting
service from “business idea” to “realization” and clients’ support on every step
of its business development. We also see an advantage in our president's and
director's business experience. She speaks foreign languages which helps her to
find appropriate approach to our potential customers. In order to take up a more
beneficial position on this market, we offer to organize a complex service
approach, that is, to offer a service package from which the client could choose
the best one. Moreover, we see an advantage in working remotely with the client.


Company Description
We intend to commence operations in the business of consulting in Thailand. Our
company plans to provide business consulting services entities and individuals
in Thailand. We offer the following set of services: investment portfolio
formation, crediting, tax planning, obtaining the certificate of


 the Board of
Investment of Thailand (BOI), legal services.

PROSPECTUS

The
information in this prospectus may be changed. These securities may
not be sold until the registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission is effective. This prospectus is
not an offer to sell these securities and it is not soliciting an
offer to buy these securities in any state where the offer or sale
is not permitted. There is no minimum purchase requirement for the
offering to proceed.

 

BITMIS
CORP.

5,000,000
SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

$0.02 PER
SHARE

 

This is
the initial offering of common stock of Bitmis Corp. (the
“Company”) and no public market currently exists for
the securities being offered. We are registering for sale a total
of 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a fixed price of $0.02 per
share to the general public in a best efforts
offering. We estimate our total offering registration costs to
be approximately $8,000. There is no minimum number of shares that
must be sold by us for the offering to proceed, and we will retain
the proceeds from the sale of any of the offered
shares. The offering is being conducted on a
self-underwritten, best efforts basis, which means our President,
Anna Varlamova, will attempt to sell the shares. We are making this
offering without the involvement of underwriters or
broker-dealers.

 

This
Prospectus will permit our President to sell the shares directly to
the public, with no commission or other remuneration payable to her
for any shares she may sell. Ms. Varlamova will sell all the shares
registered herein. In offering the securities on our behalf,
she will rely on the safe harbor from broker-dealer registration
set out in Rule 3a4-1 under the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934. The shares will be offered at a fixed price of $0.02 per
share for a period of of two hundred and forty (240) days from the
effective date of this prospectus. The offering shall terminate on
the earlier of (i) when the offering period ends (240 days from the
effective date of this prospectus), (ii) the date when the sale of
all 5,000,000 shares is completed, (iii) when the Board of
Directors decides that it is in the best interest of the Company
(in the events such as, but not limited to: downturn in economy or
inability to find investors) to terminate the offering prior the
completion of the sale of all 5,000,000 shares registered under the
Registration Statement of which this Prospectus is
part. 

 

Bitmis
Corp. has recently started its operations. To date we have been
involved primarily in organizational activities. We do not have
sufficient capital for operations. Any investment in the shares
offered herein involves a high degree of risk. You should only
purchase shares if you can afford the loss of your investment. Our
independent registered public accountant has issued an audit
opinion which includes an explanatory paragraph expressing
substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

There has
been no market for our securities and a public market may never
develop, or, if any market does develop, it may not be sustained.
Our common stock is not traded on any exchange or on the
over-the-counter market. After the effective date of the
registration statement relating to this prospectus, we hope to have
a market maker file an application with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) for our common stock to
be eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin
Board. To be eligible for quotation, issuers must remain
current in their quarterly and annual filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). If we are not able to
pay the expenses associated with our reporting obligations we will
not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board. We do
not yet have a market maker who has agreed to file such
application. There can be no assurance that our common stock will
ever be quoted on a stock exchange or a quotation service or that
any market for our stock will develop.

 

We are an
“emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”).

 

The
purchase of the securities offered through this prospectus involves
a high degree of risk. You should carefully read and consider the
section of this prospectus entitled “risk factors” on
pages 7 through 12 before buying any shares of Bitmis Corp.’s
common stock.

 

Neither
the SEC nor any state securities commission has approved or
disapproved of these securities or passed upon the adequacy or
accuracy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is
a criminal offense.

 

The
information in this prospectus is not complete and may be changed.
We may not sell these securities until the registration statement
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is effective.
This prospectus is not an offer to sell these securities and it is
not soliciting an offer to buy these securities in any state where
the offer or sale is not permitted.

PROSPECTUS
SUMMARY

 

As used in
this prospectus, unless the context otherwise requires,
“we,” “us,” “our,” and
“Bitmis Corp.” Refers to Bitmis Corp. The following
summary does not contain all of the information that may be
important to you. You should read the entire prospectus before
making an investment decision to purchase our common
stock.

 

BITMIS
CORP.

 

Bitmis
Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on June 6, 2016. We intend to
commence operations in the business of consulting in Thailand. Our
company plans to provide business consulting services entities and
individuals in Thailand. We offer the following set of services:
investment portfolio formation, crediting, tax planning, obtaining
the certificate of the Board of Investment of Thailand (BOI), legal
services

 

We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering to develop our business
operations (See “Description of Business” and
“Use of Proceeds”). To implement our plan of operations
we require a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as
described in our Plan of Operations. There is no assurance that we
will generate any revenue in the first 12 months after completion
of our offering or ever generate any revenue.

 

We have a
very limited operating history. If we do not generate any revenue,
we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for
ongoing SEC filing requirements. Our principal executive offices
are located at Unit No. 5784, 152 Chartered Square Building,
212/19, Bangkok, Thailand 10500. Our phone number is (702)
605-0123.


From inception (June 6, 2016) until the date of this filing, we
have had limited operating activities. Our financial statements
from inception (June 6, 2016) through June 30, 2016 report no
revenue and a net loss of $941. Our independent registered public
accounting firm has issued an audit opinion for Bitmis Corp., which
includes an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt as
to our ability to continue as a going concern. To date, we have
developed our business plan and business concept.

 

As of the
date of this prospectus, there is no public trading market for our
common stock and no assurance that a trading market for our
securities will ever develop.

 

Proceeds
from this offering are required for us to proceed with your
business plan over the next twelve months. We require minimum
funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our proposed operations
and pay all expenses for a minimum period of one year including
expenses associated with this offering and maintaining a reporting
status with the SEC. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of
approximately $42,000, our business may fail. Since we are
presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide
no assurance that we will successfully sell any products or
services related to our planned activities.

RISK
FACTORS

 

An
investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
should carefully consider the risks described below and the other
information in this prospectus before investing in our common
stock. If any of the following risks occur, our business, operating
results and financial condition could be seriously harmed. The
trading price of our common stock, when and if we trade at a later
date, could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all
or part of your investment.

 

Risks
related to our business

 

Because we
have a limited operating history, have yet to attain profitable
operations and will need additional financing to fund our
businesses, there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

Our
financial statements for the period from June 6, 2016 (inception)
to June 30, 2016 have been prepared assuming that we will continue
as a going concern. This means that there is substantial doubt that
we can continue as an ongoing business for the next twelve months.
The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue in
business. As such we may have to cease operations and you could
lose your investment.

 

We may
continue to lose money, and if we do not achieve profitability, we
may not be able to continue our business.

 

We are a
company with limited operations and have incurred expenses and
losses. In addition, we expect to continue to incur significant
operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate
significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur.
We expect our operating expenses to increase as a result of our
planned expansion. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be
unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or
annual basis in the future. We expect to have quarter-to-quarter
fluctuations in revenues, expenses, losses and cash flow, some of
which could be significant. Results of operations will depend upon
numerous factors, some beyond our control, including regulatory
actions, market acceptance of our products and services, new
products and service introductions, and competition.

 

We are
solely dependent upon the funds to be raised in this offering to
start our business, the proceeds of which may be insufficient to
achieve revenues and profitable operations. We may need to obtain
additional financing which may not be available.

 

Our
current operating funds are less than necessary to complete our
intended operations. We need the proceeds from this offering
to start our operations as described in the “Plan of
Operation” section of this prospectus. As of June 30,
2016, we had cash in the amount of $5,100 and liabilities of
$1,041. As of this date, we have no income and just recently
started our operation. The proceeds of this offering may not be
sufficient for us to achieve revenues and profitable operations. We
need additional funds to achieve a sustainable sales level where
ongoing operations can be funded out of revenues. There is no
assurance that any additional financing will be available or if
available, on terms that will be acceptable to us.

We
require minimum funding of approximately $42,000 to conduct our
proposed operations for a period of one year. If we are not able to
raise this amount, or if we experience a shortage of funds prior to
funding we may utilize funds from Anna Varlamova, our president,
treasurer, secretary and director, who has informally agreed to
advance funds to allow us to pay for professional fees, including
fees payable in connection with the filing of this registration
statement and operation expenses. However, Ms. Varlamova has no
formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or
loan funds to the Company. After one year we may need
additional financing. If we do not generate any revenue we may need
a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding to pay for ongoing SEC
filing requirements.

 

If we are
successful in raising the funds from this offering, we plan to
commence activities to continue our operations. We cannot provide
investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise
sufficient funds to continue our business plan according to our
plan of operations.

 

We have
commenced limited operations in our business. We expect to incur
significant operating losses for the foreseeable future.
 

 

We were
incorporated on June 6, 2016, and to date have been involved
primarily in organizational activities. We have commenced limited
business operations. Accordingly, we have no way to evaluate the
likelihood that our business will be successful. Potential
investors should be aware of the difficulties normally encountered
by new companies and the high rate of failure of such enterprises.
The likelihood of success must be considered in light of the
problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays
encountered in connection with the operations that we plan to
undertake. These potential problems include, but are not
limited to, unanticipated problems relating to the ability to
generate sufficient cash flow to operate our business, and
additional costs and expenses that may exceed current
estimates. We anticipate that we will incur increased
operating expenses without realizing any revenues. We expect to
incur significant losses into the foreseeable future. We
recognize that if the effectiveness of our business plan is not
forthcoming, we will not be able to continue business
operations. There is no history upon which to base any
assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and
it is doubtful that we will generate any operating revenues or ever
achieve profitable operations. If we are unsuccessful in
addressing these risks, our business will most likely
fail.

 

We have
limited sales and marketing experience, which increases the risk
that our business will fail.

 

We have
lack of experience in the marketing of consulting company and have
only nominal sales and marketing experience. Our future success
will depend, among other factors, upon whether our services can be
sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers
acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance
that our consulting company will gain wide acceptance in its
targeted markets or that we will be able to effectively market our
services.

 

We are in
a competitive market, which could impact our ability to gain market
share which could harm our financial performance.

 

The
business of niche of consulting service is very competitive.
Barriers to entry are relatively low, and we face competitive
pressures from companies anxious to join this niche. There are a
number of successful consulters operated by proven companies that
offer similar niche services, which may prevent us from gaining
enough market share to become successful.  These
competitors have existing customers that may form a large part of
our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to
switch over from already established competitors to our
service.  If we cannot gain enough market share, our
business and our financial performance will be adversely
affected.

 

Some of
our competitors may be able to use their financial strength to
dominate the market, which may affect our ability to generate
revenues.

 

Some of
our competitors may be much larger companies than us and very well
capitalized. They could choose to use their greater resources to
finance their continued participation and penetration of this
market, which may impede our ability to generate sufficient revenue
to cover our costs. Their better financial resources could allow
them to significantly out spend us on research and development, as
well as marketing and production. We might not be able to maintain
our ability to compete in this circumstance.

We cannot
guarantee future customers. Even if we obtain customers, there is
no assurance that we will be able to generate a profit. If that
occurs we will have to cease operations.

 

We have
not identified any customers and we cannot guarantee that we will
be able to attract future customers. Even if we obtain new
customers for our service, there is no guarantee that we will make
a profit. If we are unable to attract enough customers to
operate profitably, we will have to suspend or cease
operations.

 

Because we
are small and do not have much capital, our marketing campaign may
not be enough to attract sufficient number of customers to operate
profitably. If we do not make a profit, we will suspend or cease
operations.

 

Due to the
fact we are small and do not have much capital, we must limit our
marketing activities and may not be able to make our services known
to potential customers. Because we will be limiting our marketing
activities, we may not be able to attract enough customers to
operate profitably. If we cannot operate profitably, we may have to
suspend or cease operations.

 

Because
our president, treasurer, secretary and director will own 50% or
more of our outstanding common stock, she will make and control
corporate decisions that may be disadvantageous to minority
shareholders.

 

Ms.
Varlamova, our president, treasurer, secretary and director, will
own 50% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock.
Accordingly, she will have significant influence in determining the
outcome of all corporate transactions or other matters, including
the election of directors, mergers, consolidations and the sale of
all or substantially all of our assets, and also the power to
prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of Ms.
Varlamova may differ from the interests of the other stockholders
and may result in corporate decisions that are disadvantageous to
other shareholders.

 

We depend
to a significant extent on a certain key person, the loss of whom
may materially and adversely affect our company.

 

We depend
entirely on our president, treasurer, secretary and director, Anna
Varlamova, for all of our operations. The loss of Ms. Varlamova
would have a substantial negative effect on our company and may
cause our business to fail. Ms. Varlamova has not been compensated
for her services since our incorporation, and it is highly unlikely
that she will receive any compensation unless and until we generate
substantial revenues. There is intense competition for skilled
personnel and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms. The
loss of Ms. Varlamova’s services could prevent us from
completing the development of our plan of operation and our
business. In the event of the loss of services of such personnel,
no assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the
services of adequate replacement personnel.

 

We do not
have any employment agreements or maintain key person life
insurance policies on our officer and director. We do not
anticipate entering into employment agreements with her or
acquiring key man insurance in the foreseeable future.

 

Because
our president, treasurer, secretary and director will only be
devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be
sporadic which may result in periodic interruptions or suspensions
of operations. This activity could prevent us from attracting
enough customers and result in a lack of revenues which may cause
us to cease operations.

 

Anna
Varlamova, our president, treasurer, secretary and director will
only be devoting limited time to our operations. She will be
devoting approximately 20 hours a week to our operations. Because
our president, treasurer, secretary and director will only be
devoting limited time to our operations, our operations may be
sporadic and occur at times which are convenient to her. As a
result, operations may be periodically interrupted or suspended
which could result in a lack of revenues and a possible cessation
of operations.

Our
president, treasurer, secretary and director has no experience
managing a public company which is required to establish and
maintain disclosure control and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting.

 

We have
never operated as a public company. Anna Varlamova, our president,
treasurer, secretary and director has no experience managing a
public company, which is required to establish and maintain
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting. As a result, we may not be able to operate
successfully as a public company, even if our operations are
successful. We plan to comply with all of the various rules and
regulations, which are required for a public company that is
reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
However, if we cannot operate successfully as a public company,
your investment may be materially adversely affected.

 

Our
president, treasurer, director and secretary is non U. S. resident,
therefore investors may have difficulty enforcing any judgments
against her within the United States.

 

Our
president, treasurer, director and secretary, Ms. Varlamova is non
U.S. resident, and all or a substantial portion of her assets are
located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult
for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments
obtained against our director, including judgments predicated upon
the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States or any state thereof.

 

We are an
“emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act, and we
cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable
to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less
attractive to investors.

 

We qualify
as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As
a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an
emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

 

-

have an
auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

-

provide an
auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on
the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting;

-

comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an
auditor discussion and analysis);

-

submit
certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory
votes, such as “say-on-pay” and
“say-on-frequency;” and

-

disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the Chief Executive’s compensation to median
employee compensation.

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial
statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.

 

We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion,
(ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary
shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the
last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal
quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1
billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year
period.

 

Until such
time, however, we cannot predict if investors will find our common
stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If
some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result,
there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and
our stock price may be more volatile.

Risks
associated with this offering

 

Because
the offering price has been arbitrarily set by the Company, you may
not realize a return on your investment upon resale of your
shares.

 

The
offering price and other terms and conditions relative to the
Company’s shares have been arbitrarily determined by us and
do not bear any relationship to assets, earnings, book value or any
other objective financial criteria. Additionally, as the Company
was formed on June 6, 2016, and has only a limited operating
history with no earnings, the price of the offered shares is not
based on its past earnings, and no investment banker, appraiser, or
other independent third party, has been consulted concerning the
offering price for the shares or the fairness of the offering price
used for the shares, as such our stockholders may not be able to
receive a return on their investment when they sell their shares of
common stock.

 

We are
selling this offering without an underwriter and may be unable to
sell any shares.

 

This
offering is self-underwritten, that is, we are not going to engage
the services of an underwriter to sell the shares; we intend to
sell our shares through our President, who will receive no
commissions. There is no guarantee that she will be able to sell
any of the shares. Unless she is successful in receiving the
proceeds in the amount of $100,000 from this offering, we may have
to seek alternative financing to implement our business
plan.

 

The
regulation of penny stocks by the SEC and FINRA may discourage the
tradability of the Company's securities.

 

The shares
being offered are defined as a penny stock under the Securities and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
and rules of the Commission. The Exchange Act and such penny stock
rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure
requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities to persons
other than certain accredited investors who are, generally,
institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals
with net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding
$200,000 ($300,000 jointly with spouse), or in transactions not
recommended by the broker-dealer. For transactions covered by the
penny stock rules, a broker dealer must make certain mandated
disclosures in penny stock transactions, including the actual sale
or purchase price and actual bid and offer quotations, the
compensation to be received by the broker-dealer and certain
associated persons, and deliver certain disclosures required by the
Commission. Consequently, the penny stock rules may make it
difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase, if at
all.

 

Our
president, Ms. Varlamova does not have any prior experience
offering and selling securities, and our offering does not require
a mimimum amount to be raised. As a result of this we may not be
able to raise enough funds to commence and sustain our business and
investors may lose their entire investment.

 

Ms.
Varlamova does not have any experience conducting a securities
offering. Consequently, we may not be able to raise any funds
successfully. Also, the best effort offering does not require a
minimum amount to be raised. If we are not able to raise sufficient
funds, we may not be able to fund our operations as planned, and
our business will suffer and your investment may be materially
adversely affected. Our inability to successfully conduct a
best-effort offering could be the basis of your losing your entire
investment in us.

 

Due to the
lack of a trading market for our securities, you may have
difficulty selling any shares you purchase in this
offering.

 

We are not
registered on any market or public stock exchange. There is
presently no demand for our common stock and no public market
exists for the shares being offered in this prospectus. We plan to
contact a market maker immediately following the completion of the
offering and apply to have the shares quoted on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (“OTCBB”). The OTCBB is
a regulated quotation service that displays real-time quotes, last
sale prices and volume information in over-the-counter securities.
The OTCBB is not an issuer listing service, market or exchange.
Although the OTCBB does not have any listing requirements, to be
eligible for quotation on the OTCBB, issuers must remain current in
their filings with the SEC or applicable regulatory authority. If
we are not able to pay the expenses associated with our reporting
obligations we will not be able to apply for quotation on the OTC
Bulletin Board. Market makers are not permitted to begin quotation
of a security whose issuer does not meet this filing requirement.
Securities already quoted on the OTCBB that become delinquent in
their required filings will be removed following a 30 to 60 day
grace period if they do not make their required filing during that
time. We cannot guarantee that our application will be accepted or
approved and our stock listed and quoted for sale. As of the date
of this filing, there have been no discussions or understandings
between Bitmis Corp. and anyone acting on our behalf, with any
market maker regarding participation in a future trading market for
our securities. If no market is ever developed for our common
stock, it will be difficult for you to sell any shares you purchase
in this offering. In such a case, you may find that you are unable
to achieve any benefit from your investment or liquidate your
shares without considerable delay, if at all. In addition, if we
fail to have our common stock quoted on a public trading market,
your common stock will not have a quantifiable value and it may be
difficult, if not impossible, to ever resell your shares, resulting
in an inability to realize any value from your
investment.

 





11


 

  

 

 

We will
incur ongoing costs and expenses for SEC reporting and compliance.
Without revenue we may not be able to remain in compliance, making
it difficult for investors to sell their shares, if at
all.

 

The
estimated cost of this registration statement is $8,000, which will
be paid from offering proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less
than registration cost, we will have to utilize funds from Anna
Varlamova, our president, treasurer, secretary and director, who
has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process. Ms. Varlamova’s verbal agreement to
provide us loans for registration costs is non- binding and
discretionary. After the effective date of this prospectus, we will
be required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, or other
information with the SEC as provided by the Securities Exchange
Act. We will voluntarily continue reporting in the absence of
an SEC reporting obligation. We plan to contact a market maker
immediately following the close of the offering and apply to have
the shares quoted on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board. To be
eligible for quotation, issuers must remain current in their
filings with the SEC. In order for us to remain in compliance we
will require future revenues to cover the cost of these filings,
which could comprise a substantial portion of our available cash
resources. The costs associated with being a publicly traded
company in the next 12 month will be approximately $10,000. If we
are unable to generate sufficient revenues to remain in compliance
it may be difficult for you to resell any shares you may purchase,
if at all. Also, if we are not able to pay the expenses associated
with our reporting obligations we will not be able to apply for
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board.

 

The
Company's investors may suffer future dilution due to issuances of
shares for various considerations in the future.

 

Our
Articles of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 75,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of which
5,000,000 shares are currently issued and outstanding. If we sell
the 5,000,000 shares being offered in this offering, we would have
10,000,000 shares issued and outstanding. As discussed in the
“Dilution” section below, the issuance of the shares of
common stock described in this prospectus will result in
substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by
our existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future
services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the
effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors,
and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our
common stock.

  

FORWARD
LOOKING STATEMENTS

 

This
prospectus contains forward-looking statements that involve risk
and uncertainties. We use words such as “anticipate”,
“believe”, “plan”, “expect”,
“future”, “intend”, and similar expressions
to identify such forward-looking statements. Investors should be
aware that all forward-looking statements contained within this
filing are good faith estimates of management as of the date of
this filing. Our actual results could differ materially from those
anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons,
including the risks faced by us as described in the “Risk
Factors” section and elsewhere in this prospectus.

 


USE OF
PROCEEDS

 

Our
offering is being made on a self-underwritten and
“best-efforts” basis: no minimum number of shares must
be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price
per share is $0.02. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of
the securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no
assurance that we will raise the full $100,000 as anticipated and
there is no guarantee that we will receive any proceeds from the
offering.

The above
figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering
proceeds. If the offering proceeds are less than registration
costs, Anna Varlamova, our president and director, has verbally
agreed to loan the Company funds to complete the registration
process. Ms. Varlamova’s verbal agreement to provide us loans
for registration costs is non-binding and discretionary. Also,
these loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering
will not be sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain
reporting status and quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board
when and if our common stocks become eligible for trading on the
Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Varlamova will not be paid any
compensation or anything from the proceeds of this offering. There
is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms.
Varlamova. Ms. Varlamova will be repaid from revenues of operations
if and when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.

DETERMINATION
OF OFFERING PRICE

 

The
offering price of the shares has been determined arbitrarily by us.
The price does not bear any relationship to our assets, book value,
earnings, or other established criteria for valuing a privately
held company. In determining the number of shares to be
offered and the offering price, we took into consideration our cash
on hand and the amount of money we would need to implement our
business plan. Accordingly, the offering price should not be
considered an indication of the actual value of the
securities.

  

DILUTION

 

Dilution
represents the difference between the Offering price and the net
tangible book value per share immediately after completion of this
Offering. Net tangible book value is calculated as the total assets
of a company, minus any intangible assets, less all liabilities and
the par value of preferred stock. Dilution arises mainly as a
result of our arbitrary determination of the Offering price of the
shares being offered. Dilution of the value of the shares you
purchase is also a result of the lower book value of the shares
held by our existing stockholder.

 

The
historical net tangible book value as of June 30, 2016 was $4,059
or approximately $0.0008 per share. Historical net tangible book
value per share of common stock is equal to our total tangible
assets less total liabilities, divided by the number of shares of
common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2016. The following table
sets forth as of June 30, 2016, the number of shares of common
stock purchased from us and the total consideration paid by our
existing stockholders and by new investors in this offering if new
investors purchase 50%, 75% or 100% of the offering, after
deduction of offering expenses payable by us, assuming a purchase
price in this offering of $0.02 per share of common
stock.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION

You
should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial
condition and results of operations together with our consolidated
financial statements and the related notes and other financial
information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the
information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth
elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to
our plans and strategy for our business and related financing,
includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. You should review the “Risk Factors”
section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors
that could cause actual results to differ materially from the
results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements
contained in the following discussion and analysis.

We
qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS
Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on
exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we
are an emerging growth company, we will not be required
to:

-

have an
auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;

-

provide an
auditor attestation with respect to management’s report on
the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial
reporting;

-

comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an
auditor discussion and analysis);

-

submit
certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory
votes, such as “say-on-pay” and
“say-on-frequency;” and

-

disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee
compensation.

 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of
certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of
the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial
statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies
that comply with such new or revised accounting
standards.

 

We will
remain an “emerging growth company” for up to five
years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion,
(ii) the date that we become a “large accelerated
filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary
shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the
last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal
quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1
billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year
period.

 

Our cash
balance was $5,100 as of June 30, 2016. We believe our cash
balance is not sufficient to fund our operations for any period of
time. We have been utilizing and may utilize funds from Anna
Varlamova, our Chairman and President, who has informally agreed to
advance funds to allow us to pay for offering costs, filing fees,
and professional fees. As of June 30, 2016, Ms. Varlamova has
advanced to us $1,041. Ms. Varlamova, however, has no formal
commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan
funds to the Company. In order to implement our plan of
operations for the next twelve-month period, we require a minimum
of $42,000 of funding from this offering. We have very limited
operating history. Our principal executive offices are located at
Unit No. 5784, 152 Chartered Square Building, 212/19, Bangkok,
Thailand 10500. Our phone number is (702) 605-0123.

 

We have
generated no revenue to date. Our full business plan entails
activities described in the Plan of Operation. Long term financing
beyond the maximum aggregate amount of this offering may be
required to expand our business. The exact amount of funding will
depend on the scale of our development and expansion. We currently
have not planned our expansion, and we have not decided yet on the
scale of our development and expansion and on the exact amount of
funding needed for our long term financing. If we do not generate
any revenue we may need a minimum of $10,000 of additional funding
at the end of the twelve month period described in our “Plan
of Operation” below to maintain a reporting
status.

 

Our
independent registered public accountant has issued a going concern
opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can
continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless
we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because
we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated
until we complete our initial business development. There is no
assurance we will ever reach that stage.

 

To meet
our need for cash we are attempting to raise money from this
offering. If we are unable to successfully find customers we may
quickly use up the proceeds from this offering and will need to
find alternative sources. At the present time, we have not made any
arrangements to raise additional cash, other than through this
offering.

 

If we need
additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend
operations until we do raise the cash, or cease operations
entirely. Even if we raise $100,000 from this offering, we may need
more funds for ongoing business operations after the first year,
and would have to obtain additional funding.

PLAN OF
OPERATION

 

We were
incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2016. We have never
declared bankruptcy, have never been in receivership, and have
never been involved in any legal action or proceedings. Since
incorporation, we have not made any significant purchase or sale of
assets. We are a development stage company that has not generated
any revenue and just recently started our operations. If we are
unable to successfully find clients who will use our service, we
may quickly used up the proceeds from this offering.

 

We intend
to commence operations in the business of consulting in Thailand.
Our company plans to provide business consulting services entities
and individuals in Thailand. We offer the following set of
services: investment portfolio formation, crediting, tax planning,
obtaining the certificate of the Board of Investment of Thailand
(BOI), legal services. We intend to spend money on research and
development when our business plan is complete in order to develop
our business. We do not expect to purchase or sell plant or
significant equipment. Further we do not expect significant changes
in the number of employees.

 

Our plan
of operations is as follows:

 

1.
Complete Our Public Offering

 

We expect
to complete our public offering within 240 days after the
effectiveness of our registration statement by the Securities and
Exchange Commissions. We intend to concentrate our efforts on
raising capital during this period. Our operations will be limited
due to the limited amount of funds on hand. Upon completion of our
public offering, our specific goal is to profitably sell our
services. If we are unable to obtain minimum funding of
approximately $42,000 (If 50% of the shares sold), our business may
fail.

 

As of
today, we have started to negotiate agreements with potential
customers, and we have already presented our service to our "who we
know" list (business associates, friends, former partners
etc.).

 

Our cash
needs for the next twelve months (estimated at between $42,000 and
$92,000) and plan of operations following the completion of our
public offering is as follows:

 

2.
Office

 

We plan on
spending 1 to 2 months incurring costs for setting up the
office, which was provided by our director. We plan on purchasing
all the necessary furniture, equipment, computers, notebooks and
software. If we sell 50% of our shares, we’d plan to purchase
a basic set of furniture and equipment, as well as 1 computer and 1
laptop. In this case we intend to spend at most $5,000. If we sell
75% of our shares, we’d buy additional furniture for
conducting meetings, negotiations and conferences. In addition,
we’d plan to acquire projection equipment (a projector and
screen) for presenting our services. All of this will cost us
$6,000. If we sell all of our shares, we’d buy additional
notebooks or tablets for our sales managers. We’d also
planning on purchasing professional software to automate our
consultation services. In this case we’d spend a maximum of
$7,000.

 

 

3.
Website Developmant

 

We plan on
spending 1 to 6 months developing the website. This website
will be our primary tool for promoting our services. We plan on
hiring a professional organization to develop the website and also
to provide technical support. If we sell 50% of our shares
we’d develop a simple website with basic options. This would
cost us $5,000. If we sell 75% of our shares, then we’d add
chatting and a forum. This would increase the cost of development
by $500. If we sell 100% of our shares, then we’d develop a
website with a video presentation of our services; we’d also
create personal accounts for our clients to store files and
documents. In this case the cost of developing the website would be
approximately $6,000.

 

4.
Marketing and advertising

 

Most of
our expenses will be for marketing and advertising since we
understand that the better we actively position our company the
more clients we’ll attract. We plan to develop our
advertising campaign in 2 to 12 months . During this,
expenses will vary from $12,000 to $47,000 depending on the number
of shares sold. If we sell 50% of our shares we’d spend the
received money on promoting our website on the Internet. If we sell
75% of our shares we’d add in promotion on social networks to
our basic promotion. If we sell 100% of our shares we’d
additionally plan to participate actively in exhibitions and
publications, and also we’d plan to hire a Search Engine
Optimization organization to help us implement our marketing
plan.





15


 

  

 

 

 

5.
Consultants

 

During
9-12 months after the
completion of the offering, our consulting company will need the
consultants to provide the service. As soon as we establish our
office, develop a website and start marketing campaign we expect
more orders from our potential clients, therefore we plan to engage
with professional freelance lawyers, marketing experts,
interpreters, to carry out all the jobs concerning our service. The
Company plans to hire a sales manager to perform consultations and
direct sales in person or by phone and execute contracts with
customers on behalf of the Company. If we sell 50% of the shares
offered, we plan to hire one sales manager. In case we sell 75% and
100% of the shares, we plan to hire additional staff. The cost
range is $10,000-22,000.

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

 

We have no
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely
to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.

 

LIMITED
OPERATING HISTORY; NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

 

There is
no historical financial information about us upon which to base an
evaluation of our performance. We are in the start-up stage of
operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee
we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is
subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business
enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost
overruns due to price and cost increases in services and
products.

 

We have no
assurance that future financing will be available to us on
acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory
terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our
operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to
existing shareholders.

 

Results of
operations

 

From June
6, 2016 (Inception) to June 30, 2016

 

During the
period we incorporated the Company, prepared a business plan. Our
loss since inception is $941. We have just recently started our
business operations; however, will not start significant operations
until we have completed this offering.

 


LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

As of June
30, 2016, the Company had $5,100 of cash and our liabilities were
$1,041, comprised of an amount owed to Anna Varlamova, our
president, treasurer, secretary and director. The available capital
reserves of the Company are not sufficient for the Company to
remain operational. We require minimum funding of approximately
$42,000 to conduct our proposed operations and pay all expenses for
a minimum period of one year including expenses associated with
this offering and maintaining a reporting status with the
SEC.

 





16


 

  

 

 

Since
inception, we have sold 5,000,000 shares of common stock to our
president, treasurer, secretary and director, at a price of $0.001
per share, for net proceeds of $5,000.

 

We are
attempting to raise funds to proceed with our plan of operations.
We will have to utilize funds from Anna Varlamova, our president,
treasurer, secretary and director, who has verbally agreed to loan
the Company funds to complete the registration process if offering
proceeds are less than registration costs. However, Ms. Varlamova
has no formal commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to
advance or loan funds to the Company. Ms. Varlamova’s verbal
agreement to provide us loans for registration costs is non-binding
and discretionary. To proceed with our operations within 12 months,
we need a minimum of $42,000. We cannot guarantee that we will be
able to sell all the shares required to satisfy our 12 month
financial requirements. If we are successful, any money raised will
be applied to the items set forth in the Use of Proceeds section of
this prospectus. We will attempt to raise at least the minimum
funds necessary to proceed with our plan of operations. In the
long term we may need additional financing. Obtaining
additional funding will be subject to a number of factors,
including general market conditions, investor acceptance of our
business plan and initial results from our business operations.
These factors may impact the timing, amount, terms or conditions of
additional financing available to us. There is no assurance that
any additional financing will be available or if available, on
terms that will be acceptable to us.

 

Our
auditors have issued a “going concern” opinion, meaning
that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going
business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional
capital. No substantial revenues are anticipated until we have
completed the financing from this offering and implemented our plan
of operations. Our only source for cash at this time is investments
by others in this offering. We must raise cash to implement our
strategy and stay in business. The amount of the offering will
likely allow us to operate for at least one year and have the
capital resources required to cover the material costs with
becoming  publicly reporting. The Company anticipates over the
next 12 months the cost of being a reporting public company will be
approximately $10,000. 

 

The
Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and
reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting
company. The Company’s management will have to spend
additional time on policies and procedures to ensure it is
compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional
corporate governance time required of management could limit the
amount of time management has to implement is business plan and
impede the speed of its operations.

 

Should the
Company fail to raise a minimum of $42,000 under this offering, the
Company would be forced to scale back or abandon the implementation
of its 12-month plan of operations.

Marketing

 

We plan on
using various marketing tools to promote our services. We’re
planning for our key marketing strategy to be based on Internet
marketing, direct sales, presentations, participation in
exhibitions, and also on publications in various mass media outlets
and special catalogs. We intend for one of our promotion tools to
be the creation of a website, on which we’ll place a detailed
description of our services. Since the website will be a hallmark
for our company, we’ll attract professional developers who
will be able to create a professional website using modern web
programming technology. A forum and chat will also be organized on
our website to make direct contact with our potential clients.
We’re planning to create a multi language website, although
the most popular languages will be English, Spanish, German and
Chinese.

 

Our
website is needed for promotion, so we’re planning to
actively use Search Engine Optimization services, as well as
contextual advertising on the most popular search
engines.

 

In
addition to creating the website, we plan to create pages on social
networking sites such as Google, Tweeter, Instagram and Facebook.
This way we’ll be able to touch on all categories of
potential clients and promptly convey our information to them
regarding our services and offers.

 

We also
intend to participate in different exhibits and events associated
with the consulting business. Our potential clients will be able to
ask us questions and find out more about our approach to providing
our services, and about the opportunities we’re prepared to
provide in Thailand.

 

In our
promotion we intend to use direct sales tools. Our employees will
contact new and old clients, offering them the full spectrum of our
services.

 

Clients

 

Our
service targets individuals and legal entities that wish to start
their business activity in Thailand.  

 

We project
that our services will be interesting to the clients worldwide
because many companies and individuals are interested in business
development in Thailand.





18


 

  

 

  

Competition

 

Currently,
the market of consulting services in Thailand is quite actively
developed. Presently, there are many companies that render similar
services. In order to take up a more beneficial position on this
market, we offer to organize a complex service approach, that is,
to offer a service package from which the client could choose the
best one. Moreover, we see an advantage in working remotely with
the client.

 

Revenue

 

We plan to
receive our revenue from our potential clients for providing our
services. We plan to offer our service on the hourly basis. We
estimate our consulting service for $50 per hour.

 

Insurance

 

We do not
maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in
the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a
party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient
funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs, a judgment could be
rendered against us that could cause us to cease
operations.

 

Employees
Identification of Certain Significant Employees.

 

We are a
start up company and currently have one employee only - Anna
Varlamova, our president, treasurer, secretary and director. We
intend to hire employees on an as needed basis.

business office is located at Unit No. 5784, 152 Chartered Square
Building, 212/19, Bangkok, Thailand 10500. This is the office
provided by our President and Director, Anna Varlamova. We do not
pay any rent to Ms. Varlamova and there is no agreement to pay any
rent in the future. Our telephone number is (702)
605-0123.

 

Government
Regulation

 

We will be
required to comply with all regulations, rules, and directives of
governmental authorities including the US Securities and Exchange
Commission and agencies applicable to our business in any
jurisdiction with which we would conduct activities. We do not
believe that governmental regulations will have a material impact
on the way we conduct our business.

past ten years, none of the following occurred with respect to the

against any business of which such person was a general partner or

two years prior to that time; (2) any conviction in a criminal
proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding

cafe-bakereys “Pekarius” in Moscow. Since 2015 she has

DIRECTOR
INDEPENDENCE

Our Board
of Directors is currently composed of one member, Anna Varlamova,
who does not qualify as an independent director. In addition, our
board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to
each director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of
our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of
independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a
director. Had our Board of Directors made these determinations, our
board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information
provided by the directors and us with regard to each
director’s business and personal activities and relationships
as they may relate to us and our management.

On June
28, 2016, we issued a total of 5,000,000 shares of restricted
common stock to Anna Varlamova, our president, treasurer, secretary
and director in consideration of $5,000. Further, Ms. Varlamova has
advanced funds to us. As of June 30, 2016, Ms. Varlamova has
advanced to us $1,041. Ms. Varlamova will not be repaid from the
proceeds of this offering. There is no due date for the repayment
of the funds advanced by Ms. Varlamova. Ms. Varlamova will be
repaid from revenues of operations if and when we generate revenues
to pay the obligation. There is no assurance that we will ever
generate revenues from our operations. The obligation to Ms.
Varlamova does not bear interest. There is no written agreement
evidencing the advancement of funds by Ms. Varlamova or the
repayment of the funds to Ms. Varlamova. The entire transaction was
oral. We have a verbal agreement with Ms. Varlamova that, if
necessary, she will loan the Company funds to complete the
registration process.
