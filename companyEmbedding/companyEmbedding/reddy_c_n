Biography[edit]




National Chemical Laboratory


Born on 10 April 1971 in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, D. Srinivasa Reddy graduated in chemistry in 1991 from Osmania University and completed his master's degree from the same institution in 1993.[6] Enrolling for his doctoral studies under the guidance of Goverdhan Mehta, a noted chemist and former vice chancellor of University of Hyderabad, he moved to Indian Institute of Science when Mehta took up the position as the head of the department of organic chemistry at IISc. His PhD came from Hyderabad University in 2000, and he proceeded to the US where he did his post-doctoral work at the laboratories of Sergey A. Kozmin of the University of Chicago and Jeffrey Aubé of University of Kansas during 2001–03.[7] He started his career in 2003 as a principal scientist at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and became a research investigator in 2006 but a year later, he moved to Advinus Therapeutics as the group leader of their Discovery Chemistry research wing. In 2010, he was promoted as the section head; soon after, he left for National Chemical Laboratory where he works as a senior scientist.[8]
Legacy[edit]
Reddy's researches have been focused on total organic synthesis of molecules with a view to their applications in agricultural and medicinal uses.[9] He is credited with the total synthesis of over 20 agro-chemicals which includes a mealy bug-attracting sex pheromone that has reported use in crop protection.[3] He has also developed several other products that has potential uses as cell-adhesion inhibitors, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-cancer agents and as insect repellents.[2] He employs the Silicon-switch approach for developing drug strategies for diseases affecting the central nervous system and his work has assisted in the drug discovery for the treatment of some infectious diseases as well as diabetes. His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles;[10] Google Scholar, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 123 of them respectively.[11] He has also applied for 30 patents[6] based on his researches.[12][13][14]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

Biography[edit]




National Chemical Laboratory


Born on 10 April 1971 in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, D. Srinivasa Reddy graduated in chemistry in 1991 from Osmania University and completed his master's degree from the same institution in 1993.[6] Enrolling for his doctoral studies under the guidance of Goverdhan Mehta, a noted chemist and former vice chancellor of University of Hyderabad, he moved to Indian Institute of Science when Mehta took up the position as the head of the department of organic chemistry at IISc. His PhD came from Hyderabad University in 2000, and he proceeded to the US where he did his post-doctoral work at the laboratories of Sergey A. Kozmin of the University of Chicago and Jeffrey Aubé of University of Kansas during 2001–03.[7] He started his career in 2003 as a principal scientist at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and became a research investigator in 2006 but a year later, he moved to Advinus Therapeutics as the group leader of their Discovery Chemistry research wing. In 2010, he was promoted as the section head; soon after, he left for National Chemical Laboratory where he works as a senior scientist.[8]
Legacy[edit]
Reddy's researches have been focused on total organic synthesis of molecules with a view to their applications in agricultural and medicinal uses.[9] He is credited with the total synthesis of over 20 agro-chemicals which includes a mealy bug-attracting sex pheromone that has reported use in crop protection.[3] He has also developed several other products that has potential uses as cell-adhesion inhibitors, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-cancer agents and as insect repellents.[2] He employs the Silicon-switch approach for developing drug strategies for diseases affecting the central nervous system and his work has assisted in the drug discovery for the treatment of some infectious diseases as well as diabetes. His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles;[10] Google Scholar, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 123 of them respectively.[11] He has also applied for 30 patents[6] based on his researches.[12][13][14]
Awards and honors[edit]

Biography[edit]




National Chemical Laboratory


Born on 10 April 1971 in the south Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, D. Srinivasa Reddy graduated in chemistry in 1991 from Osmania University and completed his master's degree from the same institution in 1993.[6] Enrolling for his doctoral studies under the guidance of Goverdhan Mehta, a noted chemist and former vice chancellor of University of Hyderabad, he moved to Indian Institute of Science when Mehta took up the position as the head of the department of organic chemistry at IISc. His PhD came from Hyderabad University in 2000, and he proceeded to the US where he did his post-doctoral work at the laboratories of Sergey A. Kozmin of the University of Chicago and Jeffrey Aubé of University of Kansas during 2001–03.[7] He started his career in 2003 as a principal scientist at Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories and became a research investigator in 2006 but a year later, he moved to Advinus Therapeutics as the group leader of their Discovery Chemistry research wing. In 2010, he was promoted as the section head; soon after, he left for National Chemical Laboratory where he works as a senior scientist.[8]
Legacy[edit]
Reddy's researches have been focused on total organic synthesis of molecules with a view to their applications in agricultural and medicinal uses.[9] He is credited with the total synthesis of over 20 agro-chemicals which includes a mealy bug-attracting sex pheromone that has reported use in crop protection.[3] He has also developed several other products that has potential uses as cell-adhesion inhibitors, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory as well as anti-cancer agents and as insect repellents.[2] He employs the Silicon-switch approach for developing drug strategies for diseases affecting the central nervous system and his work has assisted in the drug discovery for the treatment of some infectious diseases as well as diabetes. His researches have been documented by way of a number of peer-reviewed articles;[10] Google Scholar, an online article repository of scientific articles, has listed 123 of them respectively.[11] He has also applied for 30 patents[6] based on his researches.[12][13][14]
Awards and honors[edit]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

As of 31 March 2014 15 board members and senior executives included.[22]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories is an Indian multinational pharmaceutical company based in Hyderabad, Telangana, India. The company was founded by Anji Reddy, who previously worked in the mentor institute Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited, of Hyderabad, India.[2] Dr. Reddy's manufactures and markets a wide range of pharmaceuticals in India and overseas. The company has over 190 medications, 60 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) for drug manufacture, diagnostic kits, critical care, and biotechnology products.
Dr. Reddy's began as a supplier to Indian drug manufacturers, but it soon started exporting to other less-regulated markets that had the advantage of not having to spend time and money on a manufacturing plant that would gain approval from a drug licensing body such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). By the early 1990s, the expanded scale and profitability from these unregulated markets enabled the company to begin focusing on getting approval from drug regulators for their formulations and bulk drug manufacturing plants in more-developed economies. This allowed their movement into regulated markets such as the US and Europe. In 2014, Dr. Reddy Laboratories was listed among 1200 of India's most trusted brands according to the Brand Trust Report 2014, a study conducted by Trust Research Advisory, a brand analytics company.[3]
By 2007, Dr. Reddy's had six FDA plants producing active pharmaceutical ingredients in India and seven FDA-inspected and ISO 9001 (quality) and ISO 14001 (environmental management) certified plants making patient-ready medications – five of them in India and two in the UK.[4]
In 2010, the family-controlled Dr Reddy's denied[5] that it was in talks to sell its generics business in India to US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer,[6] which had been suing the company for alleged patent infringement after Dr Reddy's announced that it intended to produce a generic version of atorvastatin, marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor, an anti-cholesterol medication.[7][8] Reddy's was already linked to UK pharmaceuticals multinational Glaxo Smithkline.[9]

Company history[edit]
Dr. Reddy's originally launched in 1984 producing active pharmaceutical ingredients. In 1986, Reddy's started operations on branded formulations. Within a year Reddy's had launched Norilet, the company's first recognized brand in India. Soon, Dr. Reddy's obtained another success with Omez, its branded omeprazole – ulcer and reflux oesophagitis medication – launched at half the price of other brands on the Indian market at that time.
Within a year, Reddy's became the first Indian company to export the active ingredients for pharmaceuticals to Europe. In 1987, Reddy's started to transform itself from a supplier of pharmaceutical ingredients to other manufacturers into a manufacturer of pharmaceutical products.
International expansion[edit]
The company's first international move took it to Russia in 1992. There, Dr. Reddy's formed a joint venture with the country's biggest pharmaceuticals producer, Biomed. They pulled out in 1995 amid accusations of scandal, involving "a significant material loss due to the activities of Moscow's branch of Reddy's Labs with the help of Biomed's chief executive".[10] Reddy's sold the joint venture to the Kremlin-friendly Sistema group. In 1993, Reddy's entered into a joint venture in the Middle East and created two formulation units there and in Russia. Reddy's exported bulk drugs to these formulation units, which then converted them into finished products. In 1994, Reddy's started targeting the US generic market by building state of art manufacturing facility.[citation needed]
New drug discovery[edit]

Reddy's path into new drug discovery involved targeting speciality generics products in western markets to create a foundation for drug discovery. Development of speciality generics was an important step for the company's growing interest in the development of new chemical entities. The elements involved in creating a speciality generic, such as innovation in the laboratory, developing the compound, and sending the sales team to the market, are also stages in the development of a new specialty drug. Starting with speciality generics allowed the company to gain experience with those steps before moving on to creating brand-new drugs.
Reddy's also invested heavily in establishing R&D labs and is the only Indian company to have significant R&D being undertaken overseas. Dr. Reddy's Research Foundation was established in 1992 and in order to do research in the area of new drug discovery. At first, the foundation's drug research strategy revolved around searching for analogues. Focus has since changed to innovative R&D, hiring new scientists, especially Indian students studying abroad on doctoral and post-doctoral courses. In 2000, the Foundation set up an American laboratory in Atlanta, dedicated to discovery and design of novel therapeutics. The laboratory is called Reddy US Therapeutics Inc (RUSTI) and its main aim is the discovery of next-generation drugs using genomics and proteomics. Reddy's research thrust focused on large niche areas in western markets – anti-cancer, anti-diabetes, cardiovascular and anti-infection drugs.[citation needed]
Reddy's international marketing successes were built on a strong manufacturing base which itself was a result of inorganic growth through acquisition of international and national facilities. Reddy's merged Cheminor Drug Limited (CDL) with the primary aim of supplying active pharmaceutical ingredients to the technically demanding markets of North America and Europe. This merger also gave Reddy's an entry into the value-added generics business in the regulated markets of APIs. <APIs in medicine/>
Expansion and acquisition[edit]
By 1997, Reddy's made the transition from being an API and bulk drug supplier to regulated markets like the USA and the UK, and a branded formulations supplier in unregulated markets like India and Russia, into producing generics, by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) in the USA. The same year, Reddy's out-licensed a molecule for clinical trials to Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical company.
It strengthened its Indian manufacturing operations by acquiring American Remedies Ltd. in 1999. This acquisition made Reddy’s the third largest pharmaceutical company in India, after Ranbaxy and Glaxo (I) Ltd., with a full spectrum of pharmaceutical products, which included bulk drugs, intermediates, finished dosages, chemical synthesis, diagnostics and biotechnology.[citation needed]
Reddy’s started exploiting Para 4 filing as a strategy in bringing new drugs to the market at a faster pace. In 1999 it submitted a Para 4 application for Omeprazole, the drug that had been the cornerstone of its success in India. In December 2000, Reddy’s had undertaken its first commercial launch of a generic product in the USA., and its first product with market exclusivity was launched there in August 2001. The same year, it also became the first non-Japanese pharmaceutical company from the Asia-Pacific region to obtain a New York Stock Exchange listing, ground-breaking achievements for the Indian pharmaceutical industry.[citation needed]
In 2001 Reddy’s became the first Indian company to launch the generic drug, fluoxetine (a generic version of Eli Lilly and Company’s Prozac) with 180-day market exclusivity in the USA. Prozac had sales in excess of $1 billion per year in the late 1990s. Barr Laboratories of the U.S. obtained exclusivity for all of the approved dosage forms (10 mg, 20 mg) except one (40 mg), which was obtained by Reddy’s. Lilly had numerous other patents surrounding the drug compound and had already enjoyed a long period of patent protection. The case to allow generic sales was heard twice by the Federal Circuit Court, and Reddy’s won both hearings. Reddy’s generated nearly $70 million in revenue during the initial six-month exclusivity period. With such high returns at stake, Reddy’s was gambling on the success of the litigation; failure to win the case could have cost them millions of dollars, depending on the length of the trial.
The fluoxetine marketing success was followed by the American launch of Reddy's house-branded ibuprofen tablets in 400, 600 and 800 mg strengths, in January 2003. Direct marketing under the Reddy’s brand name represented a significant step in the company’s efforts to build a strong and sustainable US generic business. It was the first step in building Reddy’s fully-fledged distribution network in the US market.[citation needed]
In 2015, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories bought the established brands of Belgian drugmaker UCB SA in South Asia for 8 billion rupees ($128.38 million).[11] Dr. Reddy's Laboratories also signed a licensing pact with XenoPort for their experimental treatment to treat plaque psoriasis. As per the agreement, Dr. Reddy’s will be granted exclusive US rights to develop and commercialize XP23829 for all indications for an upfront payment of $47.5 million.[12]
American IPO and expansion into Europe[edit]
In 2001 Reddy’s completed its US initial public offering of $132.8 million, secured by American Depositary Receipts. At that time the company also became listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Funds raised from the initial public offering helped Reddy’s move into international production and take over technology-based companies.
In 2002, Reddy’s started its European operations by acquiring two pharmaceutical firms in the United Kingdom. The acquisition of BMS Laboratories and its wholly owned subsidiary, Meridian UK, allowed Reddy’s to expand geographically into the European market. In 2003 Reddy’s also invested $5.25 million (USD) in equity capital into Bio Sciences Ltd.
Auriegene Discovery Technologies, a contract research company, was established as a fully owned subsidiary of Reddy’s in 2002. Auriegene's objective was to gain experience in drug discovery through contract research for other pharmaceutical companies. Reddy’s entered into a venture investment agreement with ICICI Bank, an established Indian banking company. Under the terms of the agreement, ICICI Venture agreed to fund the development, registration and legal costs related to the commercialization of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. Upon commercialization of these products, Dr. Reddy's pays ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of 5 years.
Global expansion[edit]
The company elected to expand globally, and acquired other entities. In March 2002, Dr. Reddy’s acquired BMS Laboratories, Beverley, and its wholly owned subsidiary Meridian Healthcare, for 14.81 million Euros. These companies deal in oral solids, liquids and packaging, with manufacturing facilities in London and Beverley in the UK. Recently, Dr. Reddy’s entered into an R&D and commercialization agreement with Argenta Discovery Ltd., a private drug development company based in the UK, for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a 10-year agreement with Rheoscience A/S of Denmark for the joint development and commercialization of Balaglitazone (DRF-2593), a molecule for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. Rheoscience holds this product’s marketing rights for the European Union and China, while the rights for the US and the rest of the world will be held by Dr. Reddy’s. Dr. Reddy’s conducted clinical trials of its cardiovascular drug RUS 3108 in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in 2005. The trials were conducted to study the safety and the pharmacokinetic profiles of the drug, which is intended for the treatment of atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular disorders.
Dr. Reddy’s entered into a marketing agreement with Eurodrug Laboratories, a pharmaceutical company based in Netherlands, for improving its product portfolio for respiratory diseases. It introduced a second-generation xanthine bronchodilator, Doxofylline, which is used for the treatment of asthma and COPD patients.
In 2004, Reddy’s acquired Trigenesis Therapeutics Inc; a US-based private dermatology company. This acquisition gave Reddy’s access to proprietary products and technologies in the dermatology sector.
Dr. Reddy’s Para 4 application strategy for generic business received a severe setback when Reddy’s lost the patent challenge in the case of Pfizer’s drug Norvasc (amlodipine maleate), a drug indicated for the treatment of hypertension and angina. The cost involved in patent litigation as well as the unexpected loss of the patent challenge affected Reddy’s plans to start speciality business in the US generic markets.
In March 2006, Dr. Reddy’s acquired Betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH from 3i for 480 million Euros. This is one of the largest-ever foreign acquisitions by an Indian pharmaceutical company. Betapharm is Germany’s fourth-largest generics pharmaceutical company, with a 3.5% market share, including 150 active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Reddy’s has promoted India’s first integrated drug development company Perlecan Pharma Pvt Ltd together with ICICI ventures capital fund management company Ltd and Citigroup Venture Capital International growth partnership Mauritius Ltd. The combined entity will undertake clinical development and out-licensing of new chemical entity assets.
Dr. Reddy's is presently licensed by Merck & Co. to sell an authorized generic version of the popular drug simvastatin (Zocor) in the USA. Since Dr. Reddy's has a license from Merck, it was not subject to the exclusivity period on generic simvastatin.[13]
As of 2006, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories exceeded $500 million USD in revenues, flowing from their APIs, branded formulations and generics segments; the former two segments account for almost 75% of revenues. Dr. Reddy's deals in and manages all the processes, from the development of the API to the submission of finished dosage dossiers to the regulatory agencies.
Patient-Centric Initiatives[edit]
In September 2016, Dr. Reddy’s launched “Purple Health” in India, a patient centric platform to deliver solutions that address unmet needs of patients.[14] Purple Health will address unmet needs of patients involving four segments: awareness, access (access to medication), adherence (adherence to therapy) and experience (simplified medication experience).[15] The first step in this program will be the launch of new patient friendly packaging for its top 25 best-selling brands, which will be rolled-out in a phased manner over the next six months. The packaging has been designed such that blister packs would have extra space for brand name which ensures easy identification at the pharmacy, a tab at the bottom with expiry date clearly mentioned, and a pictorial representation of the time the medicine needs to be taken. In case of bottles, the measuring cup is now easy to read, and neck of the bottle has been modified to ensure minimal spillage.[15][16] Purple Health also includes patient support services. For example, someone taking medicines for an advanced kidney condition would be supported by messages and counselling on diet, medicine and so on.[16]
Issues and recalls[edit]
Drug discovery problems[edit]
In September 2005, Dr. Reddy's spun off its drug discovery and research wing into a separate company called Perlecan Pharma Private Limited. At the time, this was hailed as an innovative move, but in 2008, the company had to be wound down due to funding constraints.[17] Dr. Reddy's was the first Indian pharma company to attempt such an effort to de-couple risk of drug discovery from the parent company by creating a separate company with external source of funding. Perlecan Pharma was partially funded by ICICI Venture Capital and Citigroup Venture International, both of which held a 43% stake in Perlecan for an estimated $22.5 million. However, the company was forced to buy back the Perlecan shares from ICICI and Citigroup due to doubts regarding the commercial viability of the drug candidates that were in Perlecan's pipeline. At that point, Perlecan became a wholly owned subsidiary. In the board meeting of 23 October 2008, the company chose to amalgamate/absorb Perlecan, thereby making it an in-house research facility, as it was before 2005.[17]
In 2009, the company did a U-turn and has handed over discovery research and related intellectual property to its Bangalore-based subsidiary, with the possibility of spinning it off as a different entity altogether. "The company may be hoping to find a strategic partner in the future to share the risks and research funding."[18]
2011 recall[edit]
In June 2011, certain lots of Dr. Reddy's generic simvastatin tablets were recalled due to tablets having a "musty" or "moldy" smell.[19]
On June 24, 2014, the New York Times published an article "Warning Unheeded, Heart Drugs Are Recalled" in which it said another large Indian manufacturer and "Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, have announced recalls over the past two months totalling more than 100,000 bottles" of "a widely used heart drug, Toprol XL" "because their products were not dissolving properly".
2014 FDA Form 483[edit]
In December 2014 the FDA issues a Form 483 letter over concerns discovered during an inspection of its Srikakulam facility. No specific violations were mentioned in the letter.[20][21]

Yanadi Response to Change: An attempt in Action Anthropology

Item Description: "This is a book on action anthropology which narrates and evaluates the manner in which change was brought into the life of the Yanadi who in the year 1970 were still using Stone Age methods for making fire. The juxtaposition of space age technology and primitivism at Sriharikota is brought out very effectively in the day to day interaction between the anthropologists, the SHAR administration and the Yanadi inhabitants whose lives were undergoing a major transformation. Here, significantly enough, the anthropologist emerges, not as an expert or consultant, but as a fellow human who gathers facts, diagnoses day to day problems, suggests strategies and helps in actualizing suggested solutions. His role is thus an enlarged one which demands his cooperation, understanding and total involvement in order to achieve the desired goals. The book manages to bet behind the scenes of a unique and highly successful experience which could serve as a model for an ?experimental approach? particularly in the context of the establishment of large industrial undertakings in remote and inaccessible tribal areas in India and elsewhere. Planners, administrations in addition to anthropologists and sociologists would benefit from a perusal of this interesting experiment.  Bookseller Inventory # Concept-9788170221104

Item Description: "This is a book on action anthropology which narrates and evaluates the manner in which change was brought into the life of the Yanadi who in the year 1970 were still using Stone Age methods for making fire. The juxtaposition of space age technology and primitivism at Sriharikota is brought out very effectively in the day to day interaction between the anthropologists, the SHAR administration and the Yanadi inhabitants whose lives were undergoing a major transformation. Here, significantly enough, the anthropologist emerges, not as an expert or consultant, but as a fellow human who gathers facts, diagnoses day to day problems, suggests strategies and helps in actualizing suggested solutions. His role is thus an enlarged one which demands his cooperation, understanding and total involvement in order to achieve the desired goals. The book manages to bet behind the scenes of a unique and highly successful experience which could serve as a model for an "experimental approach" particularly in the context of the establishment of large industrial undertakings in remote and inaccessible tribal areas in India and elsewhere. Planners, administrations in addition to anthropologists and sociologists would benefit from a perusal of this interesting experiment.  Bookseller Inventory # Concept-9788170221104

Item Description: PHI Learning 0. Softcover. Book Condition: New. First edition. Global warming has led to climate change which in turn has led to frequent occurrence of floods, droughts, and cold and heat waves, affecting the productivity of food grain in a large measure. This book studies the effects of regional climate change on the agriculture sector in different states of India. The book also discusses the impact of global warming on the agriculture sector across the world and describes in particular how climate change/variability is affecting rainfall, temperature and land in various states of India. It also suggests adaptation techniques which can be evolved to neutralize the adverse effects of climate change. Besides, the text explains the need for weather risk management, agromet advisory services, weather insurance, and the principles and practices of integrated watershed management through a consortium of approaches for mitigating the adverse impact of climate change in the semi-arid tropics. This book, with contributions from experts in the field and edited by academics who are authority on the subject, should prove to be extremely useful to undergraduate and postgraduate students of Agriculture, planners, policy makers and administrators.

Item Description: Oxford University Press, New Delhi, India, 2009. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Revised Edition. In todays complex and fast evolving environment, understanding Indias economy is not just an intellectual challenge, but, with the country emerging as a major global player, also a requirement. This unique volume, the first comprehensive resource of its kind on the contemporary Indian economy, aims to address this need. Culled from the collective wisdom and experience of over 200 distinguished contributors, that include economists, business leaders, policymakers, and analysts, the Companion covers the evolution of the Indian economy from relative obscurity to an emergent global force. The more than 200 entries span the recent cover stories of Indias high growth, leadership in software and information technology, and outsourcing success, and also document the backwatersthe widespread poverty, farmer suicides, child labour, and the large and impoverished informal sector that houses a majority of Indias labour force. The revised edition, a testimonial to the dynamism that epitomizes the Indian economy, includes several new topics that have grown in significance since the first edition was planned; and several revised entries on topics that have undergone rapid transformation during the short time since the first edition was written.

Item Description: B.R. Publishing Corporation, 2006. Hardcover. Book Condition: New. First edition. This volume is a collection of selected papers of the First National Seminar on Widowhood in India, organised recently by the Trivandrum-based Centre for Gerontological Studies. It gives a fair picture of Indian widows, cutting across ethnic and regional barriers. Some of the papers trace the origin and development of widowhood practices in India, some deal with special categories of widows, like the Brindaban widows, war widows, elderly widows, tribal widows, etc., others deal with the loopholes in property rights of and other legal remedies for widows and yet others deal with the double standards of society in its attitude and behaviour towards widows. The point that in spite of several social reforms and legal enactments, the widows continue to suffer from social discrimination has been brought out in the book with authenticity as also the factors contributing to the malaise. The problem assumes significance since 8% of the total women and 15% of married women in India are widows and this will make the content of this book specially significant to all concerned. The selection of papers has been done with great care and as a result, the reader can have a full view of the different dimensions of widowhood and their socio-economic and psychological underpinnings. From several points of view the book will have strong appeal to the policy maker, social reformer and scholars of women`s studies besides social scientists and social activists indeed all those concerned with the lot of a significant segment of the population the widows - who suffer from socially instituted but invidious and avoidable sufferings.

Item Description: Oxford University Press, New Delhi, India, 2009. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Revised Edition. In todays complex and fast evolving environment, understanding Indias economy is not just an intellectual challenge, but, with the country emerging as a major global player, also a requirement. This unique volume, the first comprehensive resource of its kind on the contemporary Indian economy, aims to address this need. Culled from the collective wisdom and experience of over 200 distinguished contributors, that include economists, business leaders, policymakers, and analysts, the Companion covers the evolution of the Indian economy from relative obscurity to an emergent global force. The more than 200 entries span the recent cover stories of Indias high growth, leadership in software and information technology, and outsourcing success, and also document the backwatersthe widespread poverty, farmer suicides, child labour, and the large and impoverished informal sector that houses a majority of Indias labour force. The revised edition, a testimonial to the dynamism that epitomizes the Indian economy? includes several new topics that have grown in significance since the first edition was planned; and several revised entries on topics that have undergone rapid transformation during the short time since the first edition was written.

Dr.Reddy’s in India

Dr. Reddy’s commenced its generics business in India in 1986 and is today a trusted name in the healthcare industry consistently serving the needs of millions of patients with high quality, affordable and innovative medicines across therapy areas.
Portfolio spanning wide range of therapy and disease areas
Over the years, the company has significantly grown its portfolio of products across mass and specialty therapies. Today, our portfolio has over 200 products covering the whole spectrum of disease areas spanning gastroenterology, oncology, pain management, cardiovascular, dermatology, urology, nephrology, rheumatology and diabetes. Seven of our brands are listed in “Top-300 of the Indian Pharma Market” and many others hold leadership positions in their respective categories.
Ensuring that medicines are available when needed
Dr. Reddy’s has built a robust field force driven by the zeal to make a difference in the lives of patients. The 5000-member strong team network connects with more than three lakh doctors on a regular basis to ensure that quality medicines we make are available for patients across the length and breadth of the country. Their efforts are backed by our unique inventory management system, VIVA (Viable Vision), to ensure that the medicines are available for patients when they need it.
Going beyond the pill to address patient needs
As a company we have progressively transitioned from being a maker of molecules to a provider of medicines. Along the way we developed a deeper empathy for the needs of patients and their caregivers. This has impelled Dr. Reddy’s as an organization to go beyond medicines and leverage our capabilities to meet some of these unmet patient needs. Our Purple Health initiative in India aims at taking patient care beyond the pill focusing our efforts in four areas:

Disease awareness and convenient diagnosis
Access to medicines
Better therapy experience
Adherence to therapy
