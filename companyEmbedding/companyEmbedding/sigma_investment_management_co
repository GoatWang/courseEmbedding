BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/01/2004
            

                BBB has determined that Sigma Investment Management Company Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

  Story : Sigma Investment




























































Founded in 1992, Sigma Investment Management is a fiercely independent, fee-based registered investment advisor.
We provide institutional-style management for individuals, families, trusts, charitable endowments, corporations and retirement plans.
Our approach is strategic, tactical and objective. We listen to you, understand your situation, and then build a customized portfolio strategy designed to manage risk while addressing your short-term needs and long-term goals.




Although we may not always tell you what you want to hear, we always tell you what you need to hear.

Your peace of mind is our measure of success. To reach that, we bring knowledge, discipline
				 and empathy to the investment process and work hard to earn your trust.




Knowledge
We put our expertise to work for you.
You’re expert at what you do, and you’re looking for an experienced guide to bring unsurpassed knowledge and pragmatism to bear in helping you meet your financial goals. We apply our deep understanding of investing and the markets, and collaborate with you to form a carefully crafted, overall investment plan.



Discipline
 We live by process over fads 
You’ve heard—and lived through—the financial horror stories of the past several years. We’re the partners who stand their ground to follow an investment strategy designed for your peace of mind. And like you, we’re in it for the long haul, taking care of the details while looking to the future.
We help you cut through the noise and chatter, and we won’t succumb to get-rich-quick ideas or knee-jerk reactions to trends of the day.



Empathy
We care as much as you do.
While deep knowledge of the financial world and a disciplined, diversified approach to investing are vital, they are not enough.
Rest assured we have your best interests at heart. We do what’s right for you, not what’s popular or comfortable. We make decisions with you in the context of your whole financial life.



7 Pillars of Trust
Your trust is the lifeblood of our business.
We hold ourselves accountable to 7 Pillars of Trust and would expect you to be curious:






1. 
Pragmatism- 
						Do we take the long view? Does our recommendation stem from our expertise and deep understanding of investing and the markets?


2. 
Fiduciary standard- 
						Do we put our clients’ interests above our own at every turn?


3. 
Team expertise- 
						Do we have team members who are smart, well educated and caring? Do they know their stuff better than anyone?


4. 
Smart clients- 
						Do others working in the financial industry turn to us to manage their personal finances? Are we an advisor’s advisor?




5. 
Referrals- 
						Would existing clients and centers of influence recommend us to their clients and friends?


6. 
Transparency- 
						Do we share what was on our minds and invite you to talk with us about what’s on yours?


7. 
Performance- 
						Do we adhere to the highest ethical standards while seeking investment performance?

Why Does Anyone Pay Attention to These People?
Optimism is supposed to be a virtue, and nowhere is this virtue stronger than Wall Street. Market strategists most commonly assess stock index valuation by comparing current prices to the level of future earnings predicted by the consensus of investment analysts. Stock prices are supposed to discount the present value of everything we expect is coming. Why pay attention to the past when what matters is the future

Dow 20,000 – A Brief History of Magic Market Levels
Investors obsessively focus on round numbers for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. More than half a century ago, in late 1965, Wall Street breathlessly observed the Dow approach 1,000. In both January and February 1966, the index surpassed the magic level intraday, only to slip back by the market close. A bear market ensued, shaving a quarter off the index value, and excitement subsided.

Prediction Addiction
You would think that 2016, above all other years, would have cured people of seeking predictions of the future, even leaving aside the Chicago Cubs. The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union and Donald Trump won the presidency, neither predicted by Las Vegas betting lines, political polls or prediction futures markets. Despite having failed in every possible way they could fail during the political season, pundits now confidently predict the aftermath. New Year’s predictions abound.

Annual Chart through 2016
Below is our annual listing of different asset returns (large U.S. stocks, small U.S. stocks, foreign stocks and U.S. bonds) with a box around the best-returning asset for each of the past 51 years.  The 2016 winner was small large company U.S. stocks, by far the worst of the four assets, and therefore the most in disfavor, the previous year.  The ebb and flow of each asset’s returns show that good years may just be “borrowing” future returns.  Just about the time you fall in love with an asset, it is about to under-perform.  Everyone’s attention is on large U.S. stocks now, but they have been the best fewer times than the other three.  Rather than being disappointed by the market’s inability to conform to our predictions, we act to adapt our investments to maximize the chances of achieving realistic goals.

No Country For Bold Men
In Cormac McCarthy’s novel No Country for Old Men, killer-for-hire Anton Chigurh gives some victims a chance to escape their fate by calling heads or tails on the flip of a coin. We all have made bets on the flip of a coin, so the excruciating suspense in the novel is not the result of the probabilities but from what is at stake.

Stability Creates Instability
Talk to anyone baby-boomer age or older about families and you will hear complaints about the extremes modern parents go to protect their children. Today’s toddlers will never get a bruised face from a coffee table at home, because a rubber bumper surrounds the edges.

Layers of Deception
Each significant financial market downturn reveals the excesses of the previous boom, including a number of scams and frauds. The exposure of these deceits in turn leads to the unflattering portrayals of the financial services industry in the media and further attempts to increase regulation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
