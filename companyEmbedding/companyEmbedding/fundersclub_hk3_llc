FundersClub, Where Folks Can Back Startups Online, Says It's Beating the Pros


                    Here's the caveat: Most of its returns are still on paper.

The 2012 Jobs Act let regular Americans invest in startups, spawning a glut of crowdfunding sites offering real ownership stakes in return for cash, rather than the new smartwatches or electric skateboards available on pioneering platform Kickstarter.One of these "equity crowdfunding" firms, FundersClub Inc., says it's beating most of the pros. In its first three years, returns outpaced the median venture capital fund and much of the industry's top quartile of investors, according to data provided by the company citing Cambridge Associates, which measures VC performance for pension funds and other institutional investors.FundersClub's net multiple -- investor returns after the company's cut -- is 2.26 from its 2012 investments, 3.24 from the 2013 vintage, and 1.17 for 2014. The median VC firm's net multiple for the same vintages were 1.25, 1.14 and 1.04, respectively, according to the data from FundersClub and Cambridge Associates.








"We started in 2012, and at that time, a lot of what we were doing was considered novel," said Alex Mittal, FundersClub's chief executive officer. "Since then the idea of startup investing on the internet is less novel, but what has shockingly remained the case is this pretty high level of disinterest or lack of care for returns."There are caveats. Most of FundersClub's returns are tied to the private valuations of the startups that it has backed. FundersClub sometimes holds startup investments at lower valuations than their last fundraising round, but it has still benefited from frothy, paper valuations. Of the $80 million that's been invested through FundersClub, only $3.3 million has been realized -- and some of that came in the form of more stock when portfolio companies were acquired by larger high-flying startups like Slack Technologies Inc."They have better paper returns than other folks -- if the asset class resets a bit, they'd be hurt less, you'd imagine," said Anand Sanwal, CEO of VC data firm CB Insights. "We've been in this period of very frothy valuation increases so we have to see if these companies can exit at these valuations, and we haven't seen that for a while."

FundersClub's investments include the grocery delivery company Instacart Inc., now valued at $3.4 billion, logistics company Flexport Inc., the bitcoin company Coinbase Inc., and T-shirt e-commerce site Teespring LLC. Bloomberg Beta, the VC arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack and Flexport.The site has a network of technology executives, founders, and other wealthy individuals who invest at least $3,000 per company. That's less than the standard early-stage startup investment minimum for individuals of about $50,000. The smaller check size opens up startup investing to more people, although FundersClub still requires investors to meet certain income or wealth requirements. Indeed, it dislikes the term "equity crowdfunding," preferring to call itself an online venture capital firm. AngelList LLC, another equity crowdfunding site, takes a different approach. The firm helps individual "angel" investors raise money, creating what it calls syndicates and it also helps people invest in startups directly. AngelList says unrealized returns from its 2013 syndicates are 2.4. $525 million has been invested in 1,330 startups since its founding. Equity crowdfunding hasn't become a booming business yet. Some members of Congress have floated passing legislation to let people become accredited investors on the basis of their financial know-how, not just their wealth or income. That's something Mittal believes could drive more people to startup investing.




"There is still mostly a focus on accredited investors so that hasn't brought in mom-and-pop folks -- which might be a good thing," Sanwal said. "I don't think this has become this capital-markets sensation folks were maybe talking about a few years ago. It's still a tiny asset class that's part of a relatively tiny asset class."

Newly launched FundersClub has put $509,800 in social video advertising startup Virool, joining other investors Y Combinator, 500 Startups and Yuri Milner. Formed in 2012, FundersClub is an online marketplace that allows accredited investors become equity holders in FundersClub-managed venture funds.
PRESS RELEASE
FundersClub ( www.fundersclub.com ), the world’s first venture capital platform, today announced that it has closed its first fund, investing $509,800 in social video advertising startup, Virool. FundersClub joins Y Combinator, 500 Startups and Yuri Milner as investors in Virool.
Transforming venture capital from firm to platform, FundersClub has created a unique online marketplace that allows accredited investors to become equity holders in FundersClub-managed venture funds designed to finance pre-screened private companies. As a result, deserving companies get larger, more consolidated infusions of capital from accredited investors, and access to a highly connected and experienced group of individuals with a vested interest in seeing the company succeed.
“FundersClub’s first investment marks an important milestone for the entire venture capital ecosystem,” said FundersClub co-founder and CEO, Alex Mittal. “This is the first time the venture capital model has been used online, and we’re excited to be unlocking this resource and enhancing the venture capital landscape for both investors and private companies.” 





FundersClub reviews each company via an internal Investment Committee, comprised of VC and angel investors, entrepreneurs, and operators to confirm the company meets criteria for listing; and by the FundersClub Angel Panel, a member-driven vetting group, to assess community demand. Since FundersClub’s launch in late July of this year, this process has filtered hundreds of referred companies down to 15 to raise funds via the platform. Virool was part of the first group of companies selected, and is the first to close a fund on the platform.
Virool is pioneering the concept of social video advertising, allowing anyone with a video to reach their desired target audience on Facebook, mobile phones and niche sites. Since the company’s May launch, Virool’s services have already been used by many well-recognized brands, including: Clorox, Colgate, Intel, Levis, Orbitz, Samsung, Sony, and Volkswagen.
“When our business grew faster than we expected, we realized that in order to own the market we needed additional capital,” said Virool CEO Alex Debelov. “The type of capital and value-add that FundersClub offers is a game-changer for rapidly growing startups. Being able to tap into a powerful network, at-will, for recruiting and introductions is an invaluable asset. We are thrilled to welcome FundersClub as a Virool investor.”
Through the platform, FundersClub’s more than 4,000 accredited members are able to browse and invest in individual funds established to finance pre-screened private companies. Each featured fund has a target fundraising goal, a minimum investment requirement — typically $1,000 — and a cap on the number of investors allowed to participate. The unconventionally low minimum investment size also allows FundersClub members to diversify their investments across multiple private companies, with relatively little capital. 





Now that the Virool fund is closed, FundersClub’s management entity, FundersClub Management LLC, manages the payment and investing process and serves as the fund manager. The FundersClub-managed venture fund receives and holds investor funds, makes the investment, holds and votes on the stock or holds the convertible note securities, and provides other venture capital advisory services. Because FundersClub acts as the single point of contact between fund investors and the company, companies are spared the headache of coordinating a large group of investors — making group investments an attractive option for private companies.
The platform currently features early, mid- and late-stage private U.S. technology companies from Silicon Valley and beyond. The typical company listed on FundersClub is a startup with high growth and a reputable team.

About FundersClub FundersClub is the world’s first online venture capital platform. It is built around a unique online marketplace that allows accredited investors to become equity holders in FundersClub-managed venture funds, which then fund pre-screened private companies. Each funded FundersClub startup benefits from the capital, the advice, and the professional networks of its associated venture fund, and are spared from the overhead of interfacing with a crowd of investors by receiving capital in a traditional venture capital fund format. Investors benefit from greater access to private investment opportunities, a more convenient investment process and the ability to diversify with relatively small amounts of capital. 





Launched in 2012 by serial entrepreneurs and investors Alex Mittal and Boris Silver, FundersClub aims to create prosperity and transform people’s lives by supporting innovation.
FundersClub operates and manages all venture funds. All FundersClub members with access to investment opportunities have certified as accredited investors
