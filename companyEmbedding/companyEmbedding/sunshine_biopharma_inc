About Us

						Until recently, Sunshine Biopharma has been operating as a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer.  Following the Company’s recent entry and expansion into the generic pharmaceuticals business, Sunshine Biopharma has become a fully integrated pharmaceutical company offering generic and proprietary drugs for the treatment of cancer and other acute and chronic indications.
					
						Generic Pharmaceuticals Operations
					

						Sunshine Biopharma operates a wholly owned Canadian subsidiary dedicated to conducting generic pharmaceuticals business in Canada and elsewhere around the globe.  Sunshine recently signed Cross Referencing Agreements with a major pharmaceutical company for four prescription generic drugs which Sunshine will sell under its own “SBI” label as follows:
					

SBI-Anastrozole for treatment of Breast Cancer
SBI-Letrozole for treatment of Breast Cancer
SBI-Bicalutamide for treatment of Prostate Cancer
SBI-Finasteride for treatment of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)


						Sunshine is currently in the process of securing a Drug Establishment License ("DEL") for the premises and a Drug Identification Number (“DIN”) for each of these products from Health Canada.  See "Drugs on the Market".
					

						Proprietary Drug Development Operations
					

						Sunshine Biopharma's flagship anticancer compound is Adva-27a, a small molecule that has recently been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant Cancer Cells, including Pancreatic Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells, Breast Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells.  These and other preclinical results have been Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012 (Publication PDF).  Adva-27a is currently in the IND-Enabling stage of development. We are planning to conduct our Adva-27a Phase I Clinical Trials on Pancreatic Cancer and in parallel multidrug resistant Breast Cancer patients at McGill University's Jewish General Hospital in Montreal (Canada). The US Patent Number 8,236,935 covering Adva-27a was issued on August 7, 2012. Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of this as well as all right, title and interest in and to all worldwide patents covering Adva-27a, including all issued and pending patents under PCT/FR2007/000697 and PCT/CA2014/000029. Sunshine Biopharma has not granted any licenses or rights to any entity under these patents.  See "Drugs in Development".

Interview 
	conducted by: Lynn Fosse, Senior Editor, CEOCFOinterviews.com, Published  
	March 4, 2011


CEOCFO: Dr. Slilaty, what is your main 
	focus at Sunshine Biopharma?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Sunshine Biopharma is focused on the research, development and 
	commercialization of drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer.
	


CEOCFO: What kind of drug are you 
	working on and what is different about it?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	At present our lead compound is a Topoisomerase II inhibitor.  Topoisomerase 
	II is one of the most important targets for treating aggressive cancer.


CEOCFO: How are you attacking the 
	problem?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Topoisomerase II is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of. 
	When the cell is able to make a lot of the Topoisomerase II enzyme, it 
	becomes able to proliferate and metastasize; so, if you can inhibit or 
	destroy the activity of Topoisomerase II, you would then be able to prevent 
	cancer cells from spreading.


CEOCFO: Are there other treatments now 
	or is this a new way of looking at the problem?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	There are treatments, there is a drug that is considered to be a 
	Topoisomerase II inhibitor, but it actually doesnt work as such. Our drug, 
	Adva-27a, is ten times more effective than any drug on the market for 
	treating aggressive cancer.


CEOCFO: Where are you in the process of 
	development?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We have done a lot of preclinical testing and we are now positioned to begin 
	doing animal studies and immediately after begin stage I clinical trials.
	


CEOCFO: Is there a particular type of 
	cancer that you are targeting first, and why?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Initially we are working on the so-called multi-drug resistant breast 
	cancer. In a certain group of breast cancer patients, as well as over time 
	in a lot of cancer patients, the tumor becomes resistant to all treatment 
	and at that point there is not much to do by way of existing therapy. Our 
	drug works extremely well in killing multi-drug resistant breast cancer 
	cells. That is our first indication. 


CEOCFO: How did you come about the drug?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We developed it ourselves in collaboration with a government research lab in 
	France. 


CEOCFO: Where is testing being done?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We have done testing in France and now we are carrying out testing at the 
	Binghamton University in New York. 


CEOCFO: What is the financial picture 
	like for Sunshine Biopharma?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We are in good shape. We have sufficient funds to operate and we are 
	planning to apply for support through granting agencies in the U.S. through 
	our collaboration with Binghamton University.


CEOCFO: Has the medical community 
	started to pay attention or is it a bit early for that?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	It is a bit early because we have not publicized what we have yet. 



CEOCFO: Are you looking to partner or at 
	what point would you perhaps go from doing it on your own to adding some 
	other sources?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We imagine that at the end of Phase I, once we publish the results of human 
	trials, we expect that large pharmaceutical companies will want to probably 
	step in and buy it from us at that point. 


CEOCFO: Are there other indications that 
	you are considering?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Another indication we are looking to study is prostate cancer and as with 
	breast cancer, our drug has proven to be very effective in treating 
	aggressive forms of prostate cancer. That would be a second indication.


CEOCFO: Is here a similarity between the 
	two types of cancer?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	The similarity is that different types of cancer cells make different 
	amounts of this Topoisomerase II enzyme. The more Topoisomerase II the cell 
	makes, the more effective our drug is at killing that cell. What that means 
	is when prostate cancer become metastatic, which is when the cell starts 
	making a lot of Topoisomerase II, is when our drug becomes very effective in 
	treating that cancer. There are other types of cancer, like small cell lung 
	cancer where initially, or right at the point of diagnosis of this type of 
	cancer, the cell is already making a lot of Topoisomerase II and it is very 
	aggressive at the onset. In fact, patients that are diagnosed with small 
	cell lung cancer only have three to six months to live. We have already 
	shown in the lab that our drug works extremely well in terms of killing this 
	type of lung cancer cells. 


CEOCFO: What is the timetable?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	We believe that we will be able to begin the human trials optimistically 
	about twelve months from now, but more realistically within the next 
	eighteen months.

CEOCFO: Why should potential investors 
	choose Sunshine Biopharma out of the crowd?

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Our technology is unique. We are the only company that has a Topoisomerase 
	II inhibitor. We have two patents covering our lead compound and our 
	technology. So from the intellectual property side we are very well 
	protected and no one can enter the area we are in. We are not developing 
	anything that is a so-called me-too drug; our technology is unique.


CEOCFO: So there is a potential real 
	breakthrough here!

Dr. 
	Slilaty: 
	Absolutely! If our drug proves to do in humans exactly what we think, it 
	will be worth over a billion dollars.


CEOCFO: Final thoughts, what should 
	people remember most when they read about Sunshine Biopharma?


Dr. Slilaty: 
	We are a very serious group of oncologists who are trying to provide therapy 
	to save lives and bring value to our shareholders.

MONTREAL, QC--(Marketwired - June      30, 2016) -   Sunshine Biopharma Inc. (OTCQB: SBFM), a pharmaceutical company focused on the research, development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer, is pleased to announce that it has signed a Cross Referencing Agreement with a major pharmaceutical company for three additional prescription generic drugs for treatment of Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer and Enlarged Prostate. Sunshine will market and sell these new pharmaceutical products under its own label.

Sunshine's three new generic products together with the previously announced initial generic product are as follows:


Anastrozole (brand name Arimidex® by AstraZenica) for treatment of Breast Cancer 
Letrozole (brand name Femara® by Novartis) for treatment of Breast Cancer 
Bicalutamide (brand name Casodex® by AstraZenica) for treatment of Prostate Cancer 
Finasteride (brand name Propecia® by Merck) for treatment of BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)


Worldwide sales of the brand name version of these products as reported by the respective owner of the registered trademark are as follows:


Arimidex® $250M in 2015 
Femara® $380M in 2014 
Casodex® $267M in 2015 
Propecia® $183M in 2015


Sunshine is currently in the process of securing a Drug Identification Number ("DIN") for each of these products from Health Canada. The Company is also working on obtaining a Drug Establishment License ("DEL") from Health Canada. Upon receipt of the DEL and DIN's, Sunshine will be able to accept orders for its own label SBI-Anastrozole, SBI-Letrozole, SBI-Bicalutamide and SBI-Finasteride. Sunshine expects to build a portfolio of "SBI" label Generic Pharmaceuticals over time.

Revenues from sales of Generic Products are intended to be used to finance the Company's proprietary drug development program including Adva-27a, the Company's flagship anticancer compound. A Topoisomerase II inhibitor, Adva-27a is a small molecule that has recently been shown to be effective at destroying Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer cells, Pancreatic Cancer cells, Small-Cell Lung Cancer cells and Uterine Sarcoma cells (Published in ANTICANCER RESEARCH, Volume 32, Pages 4423-4432, October 2012). Sunshine Biopharma is direct owner of all issued and pending worldwide patents pertaining to Adva-27a including U.S. Patent Number 8,236,935.
