MEDICAL TREATMENT SYSTEM AND METHODS USING A PLURALITY OF FLUID LINES



Publication number:  20170157310
                                            

Abstract:  A medical treatment system, such as peritoneal dialysis system, may include control and other features to enhance patient comfort and ease of use. For example, a peritoneal dialysis system may include a control system that can adjust the volume of fluid infused into the peritoneal cavity to prevent the intraperitoneal fluid volume from exceeding a pre-determined amount. The control system can adjust by adding one or more therapy cycles, allowing for fill volumes during each cycle to be reduced. The control system may continue to allow the fluid to drain from the peritoneal cavity as completely as possible before starting the next therapy cycle. The control system may also adjust the dwell time of fluid within the peritoneal cavity during therapy cycles in order to complete a therapy within a scheduled time period.

Regulated apoptosis using chemically induced dimerization of apoptosis factors



Publication number:  20040040047
                                            

Abstract:  The present invention discloses artificial death switches (ADSs) based on chemically induced dimerization of the cysteine proteases, caspase-1 (ICE) and caspase-3 (YAMA). In both cases, aggregation of the target protein is achieved by a non-toxic, lipid-permeable, dimeric FK506 analog that binds to an attached FK506-binding protein (FKBP). The intracellular crosslinking of caspase-1 or caspase-3 is sufficient to trigger rapid apoptosis in a Bcl-xL-independent manner, suggesting that these conditional pro-apoptotic molecules can bypass intracellular checkpoint genes, like Bcl-xL, that limit apoptosis. Since these chimeric molecules are derived from autologous proteins, they should be non-immunogenic and thus ideal for long-lived gene therapy vectors. These properties should also make chemically-induced apoptosis (CIA) useful for developmental studies, for treating hyperproliferative disorders and for developing animal models to a wide variety of diseases.

Patent number:  6165787
                                            

Abstract:  Dimerization and oligomerization of proteins are general biological control mechanisms that contribute to the activation of cell membrane receptors, transcription factors, vesicle fusion proteins, and other classes of intra- and extracellular proteins. We have developed a general procedure for the regulated (inducible) dimerization or oligomerization of intracellular proteins. In principle, any two target proteins can be induced to associate by treating the cells or organisms that harbor them with cell permeable, synthetic ligands. To illustrate the practice of this invention, we have induced: (1) the intracellular aggregation of the cytoplasmic tail of the .zeta.

Spencer, David, Ph.D.






Baylor College of MedicineResearchOffice of ResearchDeBakey AwardsRecipientsSpencer, David, Ph.D. 















Immunology




2007 Recipient



David M. Spencer, Ph.D.


Enhanced Dendritic Cell-based Immunotherapy for CancerDr. Spencer received the award for his work on developing a novel immune therapy-based approach to treating cancer, which relies on a small-molecule dimerizer to improve dendritic cell (DC) function. In one iteration, they used the chemically induced dimerization (CID) technology he co-invented years earlier to manipulate the costimulatory CD40 molecule in DCs, leading to a much more potent vaccine against poorly immunogenic self-peptides. In a complementary approach, his group developed a novel potent constitutive Akt allele and applied this technology to extending the lifespan and potency of DCs in several vaccine models. After demonstrating equally impressive potency in human DCs, Dr. Spencer initiated collaborations with colleagues on related clinical studies. Dr. Spencer also developed a series of state-of-the-art non-immunogenic suicide genes for gene therapy, which utilize endogenous caspase family proteases and CID technology. These inducible caspases are likely to become increasingly important as a safety switch for retrovirus-based gene therapy and are the basis of upcoming clinical studies. The Spencer lab has used these conditional pro-apoptotic molecules as part of a potent, novel neoadjuvant therapy for prostate cancer. Dr. Spencer's nomination was based on the following publications: Hanks BA, Jiang J, Singh RA, Song W, Barry M, Huls MH, Slawin KM, Spencer DM. Re-engineered CD40 receptor enables potent pharmacological activation of dendritic-cell cancer vaccines in vivo. Nat Med. 2005 Feb;11(2):130-7. Nikitina EY, Desai SA, Zhao X, Song W, Luo AZ, Gangula RD, Slawin KM, Spencer DM.Versatile prostate cancer treatment with inducible caspase and interleukin-12. Cancer Res. 2005 May 15;65(10):4309-19. Park D, Lapteva N, Seethammagari M, Slawin KM, Spencer DM. An essential role for Akt1 in dendritic cell function and tumor immunotherapy. Nat Biotechnol. 2006 Dec;24(12):1581-90. Lapteva N, Seethammagari MR, Hanks BA, Jiang J, Levitt JM, Slawin KM, Spencer DM.Enhanced activation of human dendritic cells by inducible CD40 and Toll-like receptor-4 ligation. Cancer Res. 2007 Nov 1;67(21):10528-37.

Bellicum Appoints Baylor College of Medicine’s David M. Spencer as Chief Scientific Officer  

 Press Releases  



Houston, TX, April 12, 2012 – Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced today the appointment of David M. Spencer, Ph.D. to Chief Scientific Officer. Dr. Spencer, a co-founder of Bellicum, joins the Company from Baylor College of Medicine where he was Vice Chairman of Pathology and Immunology. Dr. Spencer is the co-inventor of chemical induction of dimerization (CID), a technology used to control a wide range of biologic functions in cells, and applied in the Company’s two lead product candidates.
“We’re pleased to have David join Bellicum and bring with him a singularly unique knowledge of the science behind our products,” commented Tom Farrell, CEO of Bellicum Pharmaceuticals. “I look forward to his many contributions as we evaluate two new potentially breakthrough product candidates.”
Dr. Spencer received The Michael E. DeBakey, M.D., Excellence in Research Award from Baylor College of Medicine in 2007 for his work developing a novel immune therapy-based approach to treating cancer, which relies on a small-molecule, CID, to improve dendritic cell function. In one iteration, Dr. Spencer’s team used CID technology, which he co-invented, to create a much more potent vaccine against poorly immunogenic self-peptides. Dr. Spencer also developed a series of state-of-the-art, non-immunogenic suicide genes for gene therapy, which utilize endogenous caspase family proteases and CID technology. These inducible caspases are likely to become increasingly important as a safety switch for retrovirus-based gene therapy and cellular therapies, in general. This technology is the basis of two Bellicum clinical programs, including CaspaCIDe™ for the management of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
Phase 1 results from an ongoing clinical trial of CaspaCIDe were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November of last year. The study reported that the “suicide gene” effectively caused the rapid and complete reversal of GVHD in acute leukemia patients who underwent stem cell transplant.
Dr. Spencer earned his Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and completed his postdoctoral degree at Stanford University.
About Bellicum Pharmaceuticals
Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing clinical applications of chemical induction of dimerization (CID), a drug-based remote control technology that extends the physician’s reach beyond the point at which a treatment has been administered. Bellicum’s mission is to leverage this smart technology to bring safe, effective, innovative cell therapies to market for patients with serious and life threatening diseases. The company’s DeCIDe™ vaccines are designed to kill targeted cells by inducing a potent, durable, fully activated antigen-specific T cell immune response. Lead product BPX-101, an autologous DeCIDe vaccine, is in clinical development for patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). CaspaCIDe™ is a cell therapy safety switch, permitting the rapid elimination of cells in the event of toxicity. CaspaCIDe DLI is a donor lymphocyte infusion administered following a hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in which the safety switch may be activated to resolve graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).
