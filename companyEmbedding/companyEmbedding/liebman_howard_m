Jones Day





                            Howard Liebman leads Jones Day's Tax practice in Brussels. He focuses on international tax and corporate structuring, coordinating both the corporate and tax sides of transnational M&A, joint ventures, and restructurings.      Howard most recently represented NextiraOne Europe in its sale of 16 affiliates in 13 separate countries throughout Western and Eastern Europe to Dimension Data Group (part of NTT). He also represented Platinum Equity in its acquisition of the MACtac group of companies in Europe from Bemis Corp., its pan-European (Dutch, Swedish, U.K., Romanian) acquisition of the Geesink Norba Group from Oshkosh Corporation and its subsequent sale to a German private equity fund, as well as the purchase of the 3B-Fibreglass manufacturing business (Belgium, Norway, Tunisia, Luxembourg) from Owens Corning and its subsequent sale to the Binani Group of India. He has advised on many pan-European tax and corporate structuring and M&A projects for IT companies such as IBM, Fujitsu Consulting and NextiraOne Europe; U.S. tax matters for UCB and Solvay (two major, Belgium-based pharma/chemical groups) and AP Moller-Maersk; and pan-Latin American structuring assignments for various other multinationals.      Howard is the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, which often takes the lead in lobbying for U.S. industry in Belgium and the EU. He is the coauthor of the BNA Portfolio (No. 999 - 2nd) on "Doing Business in the European Union" and has chaired panels, acted as rapporteur or spoken at Congresses of the International Fiscal Association in Stockholm, Eilat and Amsterdam. He is also the Belgian correspondent of Tax Management International Forum and frequently publishes articles on international taxation in U.S. and European journals.Education:J.D., Harvard Law School (1977) cum laudeA.M., International Relations, Colgate University (1975) with honors A.B., International Relations & Economics, Colgate University (1974) summa cum laudeBloomberg BNA Tax Management Portfolios:999 T.M., Business Operations in the European Union (co-author)

Speaking Engagements








Howard Liebman leads Jones Day's Tax practice in Brussels. He focuses on international tax and corporate structuring, coordinating both the corporate and tax sides of transnational M&A, joint ventures, and restructurings.
Howard most recently represented Platinum Equity first in the purchase of MACtac Europe from Bemis Corporation and then in the sale of the European and Asian operations to Avery Dennison. He also recently represented the purchaser of companies owning approximately 60,000 hectares of farmland in Russia, and NextiraOne Europe in its sale of 16 affiliates in 13 separate countries throughout Europe to Dimension Data. He represented Platinum Equity in both its Dutch-Swedish-U.K.-Romanian acquisition of the Geesink Norba Group from Oshkosh Corporation and its subsequent sale to a German private equity fund, as well as the purchase of the 3B-Fibreglass manufacturing business (Belgium/Norway) from Owens Corning and its subsequent sale to the Binani Group of India. He has advised on many pan-European tax and corporate structuring projects and U.S. and pan-Latin American tax and structuring assignments for European corporate groups.
Howard is the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Belgium, after having chaired its Legal & Taxation Committee for 12 years, taking the lead in lobbying on issues of concern to U.S. industry in Belgium. He is the coauthor of the BNA Portfolio (No. 999 - 2nd) on "Doing Business in the European Union" (the third edition is to be published in the Fall of 2015) and has chaired and spoken at many Congresses of the International Fiscal Association.
