Allianz 360SM Annuity
    




Overview
How the product works
Product video

It's natural to be concerned about saving enough for retirement – but it's important to have an income strategy, too. Allianz 360SM Annuity with its 360 Benefit rider1 can help.
Like all fixed index annuities, Allianz 360 Annuity and the 360 Benefit rider (included at an additional cost) offer you principal protection from market downturns, potential indexed interest, and the potential for tax-deferred growth. 
Plus, Allianz 360 Annuity and the 360 Benefit rider go one step further by giving you:

an interest bonus2 equal to 25% of the interest that is credited to your contract until withdrawals begin,
increasing income withdrawal percentages beginning at age 40, and
a choice of lifetime income withdrawal options beginning at age 50.

The bonus is credited each year the selected allocations earn interest. During the first 10 contract years, we will apply a surrender charge if the contract is partially or fully surrendered. These charges may result in a loss of, indexed interest and fixed interest, interest bonus and a partial loss of principal (premium).
Allianz 360 Annuity may be a good choice if you're looking for retirement accumulation opportunities, with the flexibility to start receiving lifetime retirement income when you're ready.
Watch the videos to learn more


1 The annual charge for the 360 Benefit rider is 1.15% of the contract's accumulation value. You can cancel the 360 Benefit rider anytime after the fifth contract year. Once you terminate the 360 Benefit rider it may not be reinstated.
2 Bonus annuities may include higher surrender charges, longer surrender periods, lower caps, higher spreads, or other restrictions that are not included in similar annuities that don't offer a bonus.

Don Scifres 
VisionTech








"We have been looking for a deal management platform to help us streamline the process for both entrepreneurs and investors involved in our accelerator program and Venture360 has proven to be an outstanding tool.  From applications to e-signatures of documents and from an early stage investment to syndication we have found the platform to have a robust set of features that helped us streamlines our process."







Derrick Thompson 
Startup Runner








"After traveling the country and vetting hundreds of companies on our DEMO Tour, we are excited to bring Venture360 as one of the few companies launching new products solving big problems at DEMO Fall 2014. Venture360 has the potential to be a game-changer."







Erick Schonfeld

Continuing to build out our own processes together with V360 is very valuable to us and it's refreshing to be able to handle this together with V360."







Chris

"We have assessed many platforms and in our opinion, the features and benefits of Venture360 make it the only platform to meet the needs of the individual angel investors, while simultaneously meeting the needs of the angel fund.
