Microdisplays[edit]
President John C.C. Fan describes the company's growth strategy as being based on expanding the range of applications for microdisplays.[1]
Kopin has attempted to combat the trend of digital cameras being released without viewfinders through the development of tiny electronic displays, aimed at inclusion in higher-end cameras rather than budget models.[2] Kopin's first CyberDisplay product debuted in 1999 in a JVC digital camera; it featured a 320x240 pixel display with a 0.24 inches (0.61 cm) diagonal measurement.[3] In 2007, the Olympus Corporation chose a Kopin CyberDisplay with QVGA-level resolution for inclusion as a viewfinder in its SP-550 UZ model.[4] In 2012, the company's newest CyberDisplay model had a diagonal measurement of 0.27 inches (0.69 cm) with VGA-level resolution of 640x480 pixels.[2]
Outside of the consumer market, Kopin's microdisplays have also been used in electronics devices aimed at the military and law enforcement officers. In 2008, the United States Army awarded Kopin with the first phase of a $4.2 million program aimed at producing microdisplays more quickly and improving their performance, with the aim of incorporating them in night vision devices.[5] In 2009, Kopin introduced its Golden-i headset computer, aimed at firefighters and security professionals.[6] NBC reporter Monica J. Vila named the 2013 version of the Golden-i it as one of her favorite devices introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, even though it was not aimed at the consumer market.[7] Later that year there was speculation that Kopin might enter into a deal with Microsoft or Apple to provide components for any optical head-mounted display product those companies might manufacture to compete with Google Glass, after Google chose Kopin's competitor Himax to supply components for Google Glass; however, analyst Karl Guttag stated to Seeking Alpha that he saw this as unlikely.[8]
Other products[edit]
Kopin also manufactures heterojunction bipolar transistors. Among its customers for this product line is Woburn, Massachusetts-based Skyworks Solutions.[9]
Acquisitions[edit]
In January 2011, Kopin acquired British optoelectronics company Forth Dimension Displays (FDD) for £7 million in cash. Kopin's president John Fan indicated in media comments that Kopin was especially interested in FDD's ultra-high resolution reflective microdisplays and time domain imaging technology.[10]
Controversy[edit]
In July 1999, Neil Bush, (son to President George H.W. Bush and brother to President George W. Bush) made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of Kopin Corp. where he had been employed as a consultant. The company announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, "any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information."[11] When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.[12]

The Kopin Corporation (NASDAQ: KOPN) is a Westborough, Massachusetts-based electronics manufacturer, best known for its display devices for mobile electronics.

Microdisplays[edit]
President John C.C. Fan describes the company's growth strategy as being based on expanding the range of applications for microdisplays.[1]
Kopin has attempted to combat the trend of digital cameras being released without viewfinders through the development of tiny electronic displays, aimed at inclusion in higher-end cameras rather than budget models.[2] Kopin's first CyberDisplay product debuted in 1999 in a JVC digital camera; it featured a 320x240 pixel display with a 0.24 inches (0.61 cm) diagonal measurement.[3] In 2007, the Olympus Corporation chose a Kopin CyberDisplay with QVGA-level resolution for inclusion as a viewfinder in its SP-550 UZ model.[4] In 2012, the company's newest CyberDisplay model had a diagonal measurement of 0.27 inches (0.69 cm) with VGA-level resolution of 640x480 pixels.[2]
Outside of the consumer market, Kopin's microdisplays have also been used in electronics devices aimed at the military and law enforcement officers. In 2008, the United States Army awarded Kopin with the first phase of a $4.2 million program aimed at producing microdisplays more quickly and improving their performance, with the aim of incorporating them in night vision devices.[5] In 2009, Kopin introduced its Golden-i headset computer, aimed at firefighters and security professionals.[6] NBC reporter Monica J. Vila named the 2013 version of the Golden-i it as one of her favorite devices introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, even though it was not aimed at the consumer market.[7] Later that year there was speculation that Kopin might enter into a deal with Microsoft or Apple to provide components for any optical head-mounted display product those companies might manufacture to compete with Google Glass, after Google chose Kopin's competitor Himax to supply components for Google Glass; however, analyst Karl Guttag stated to Seeking Alpha that he saw this as unlikely.[8]
Other products[edit]
Kopin also manufactures heterojunction bipolar transistors. Among its customers for this product line is Woburn, Massachusetts-based Skyworks Solutions.[9]
Acquisitions[edit]
In January 2011, Kopin acquired British optoelectronics company Forth Dimension Displays (FDD) for £7 million in cash. Kopin's president John Fan indicated in media comments that Kopin was especially interested in FDD's ultra-high resolution reflective microdisplays and time domain imaging technology.[10]
Controversy[edit]
In July 1999, Neil Bush, (son to President George H.W. Bush and brother to President George W. Bush) made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of Kopin Corp. where he had been employed as a consultant. The company announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, "any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information."[11] When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.[12]

Microdisplays[edit]
President John C.C. Fan describes the company's growth strategy as being based on expanding the range of applications for microdisplays.[1]
Kopin has attempted to combat the trend of digital cameras being released without viewfinders through the development of tiny electronic displays, aimed at inclusion in higher-end cameras rather than budget models.[2] Kopin's first CyberDisplay product debuted in 1999 in a JVC digital camera; it featured a 320x240 pixel display with a 0.24 inches (0.61 cm) diagonal measurement.[3] In 2007, the Olympus Corporation chose a Kopin CyberDisplay with QVGA-level resolution for inclusion as a viewfinder in its SP-550 UZ model.[4] In 2012, the company's newest CyberDisplay model had a diagonal measurement of 0.27 inches (0.69 cm) with VGA-level resolution of 640x480 pixels.[2]
Outside of the consumer market, Kopin's microdisplays have also been used in electronics devices aimed at the military and law enforcement officers. In 2008, the United States Army awarded Kopin with the first phase of a $4.2 million program aimed at producing microdisplays more quickly and improving their performance, with the aim of incorporating them in night vision devices.[5] In 2009, Kopin introduced its Golden-i headset computer, aimed at firefighters and security professionals.[6] NBC reporter Monica J. Vila named the 2013 version of the Golden-i it as one of her favorite devices introduced at the Consumer Electronics Show that year, even though it was not aimed at the consumer market.[7] Later that year there was speculation that Kopin might enter into a deal with Microsoft or Apple to provide components for any optical head-mounted display product those companies might manufacture to compete with Google Glass, after Google chose Kopin's competitor Himax to supply components for Google Glass; however, analyst Karl Guttag stated to Seeking Alpha that he saw this as unlikely.[8]
Other products[edit]
Kopin also manufactures heterojunction bipolar transistors. Among its customers for this product line is Woburn, Massachusetts-based Skyworks Solutions.[9]
Acquisitions[edit]
In January 2011, Kopin acquired British optoelectronics company Forth Dimension Displays (FDD) for £7 million in cash. Kopin's president John Fan indicated in media comments that Kopin was especially interested in FDD's ultra-high resolution reflective microdisplays and time domain imaging technology.[10]
Controversy[edit]
In July 1999, Neil Bush, (son to President George H.W. Bush and brother to President George W. Bush) made at least $798,000 on three stock trades in a single day of Kopin Corp. where he had been employed as a consultant. The company announced on the same day good news about a new Asian client that sent its stock value soaring. Bush stated that he had no inside knowledge and that his financial advisor had recommended the trades. He said, "any increase in the price of the stock on that day was purely coincidental, meaning that I did not have any improper information."[11] When asked in January 2004 about the stock trades, Bush contrasted the capital gains he reported in 1999 and 2000 with the capital losses on Kopin stock he reported ($287,722 in all) in 2001. In 2001 Kopin joined a broad decline in high-tech stock valuations.[12]

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

NanoJet Process to be Applied to Mass Production of Wearable Products

 WESTBOROUGH, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Kopin® Corporation (NASDAQ: KOPN), a leading developer of
      innovative wearable computing technologies and solutions, announced that
      it has developed a revolutionary NanoJet process for its liquid crystal
      cell assembly. The NanoJet process releases tiny drops of liquid crystal
      material with greater precision (variation within a few nano grams) and
      provides for a purer, better controlled and very uniform layering of the
      liquid crystal material in the fabrication of displays, resulting in
      superior image quality and higher brightness.
    

      “The patent-pending Nanojet process developed at Kopin is optimized for
      microdisplays with tiny pixels required for augmented reality (AR) and
      virtual reality (VR) applications,” said Dr. John C.C. Fan, President
      and CEO of Kopin Corporation. “This process improves the display
      performance and reduces the cost to manufacture the display. The Nanojet
      process can be used in the manufacture of both our transmissive
      Cyberdisplay® and reflective LCOS displays. We are qualifying
      the NanoJet process and expect a tier-one customer to introduce in
      coming months a wearable product which includes a display manufactured
      using the Nanojet process. It is our intention to apply this superior
      process to many of our current products where ever possible.”
    

      Advantages of the NanoJet process include:
    


        Maintenance of purity of the liquid crystal in the display fabrication
        process
      

        Excellent control of cell gap and cell gap uniformity across the wafer
        and within each display, even for large (~1” diagonal) high-resolution
        microdisplays for VR without the use of posts inside the display
      

        Reduced display cost due to higher manufacturing yield and less liquid
        crystal material usage
      


      Display performance improvements include:
    


        Superior image quality
      

        Much higher display brightness: in excess of 10,000 nits for
        full-color displays with tiny pixels (3 x 9 µm) typically needed for
        smart headsets.
      

        Increased high temperature operating range

WhyWearables?



		How we communicate is evolving. We're breaking away from systems that require us to adapt to them, and moving towards technologies that allow us to engage in the world.
	






Over the last 30 years, Kopin has been a critical driver in the proliferation of wireless technologies around the globe. Now, Kopin is providing wearable products that capitalize on the wireless internet that it helped create.
From the first portable video cameras to the advancement of smart phones, Kopin’s technologies have made innovation possible. Now, as technology moves beyond handheld devices, Kopin is poised to power the next wave of personal communication wearables.
Kopin’s portfolio includes ultra-small displays, optics, speech enhancement technology, software, low-power chipsets, and ergonomically designed Smart Eyewear and Hearables.
How we see, hear and communicate, Kopin will enhance it.






Kopin has a long history of working with the military to create advanced optical systems based on its ultra small microdisplay, optic, backlight and electronic technologies. From fighter pilot helmet displays, night vision binoculars to thermal weapon gunsights, Kopin’s technology is designed for the toughest environments, which means it’s rugged enough for anything you throw at it.



Without Kopin’s heterojunction bipolar transistor wafers, smartphones might not be as ubiquitous as they are today. Its ability to both conserve as well as amplify power made it an ideal choice for carriers to use when launching new networks. Today, billions of these chips power mobile phones across the globe, allowing them to transmit and receive data at blazing speeds.



Kopin’s CyberDisplay, created in 1999, was the first electronic viewfinder for camcorders. This technology replaced the decades’ old cathode ray tube displays, leading to more than 30 million units.
