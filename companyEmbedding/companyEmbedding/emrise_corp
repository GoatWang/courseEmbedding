SWOT Analysis
SWOT, which stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats, is an analytical framework that identifies the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable for a company.

Enhanced SWOT Analysis
Enhanced SWOT is a 3×3 grid that arranges strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats into one scheme:

How to use the strengths to take advantage of the opportunities?
How to use the strengths to reduce likelihood and impact of the threats?
How to overcome the weaknesses that obstruct taking advantage of the opportunities? 
How to overcome the weaknesses that can make the threats a reality?

Upon answering these questions a company can develop a project plan to improve its business performance.

PESTEL Analysis
PESTEL (also termed as PESTLE) is an ideal tool to strategically analyze what influence different outside factors – political, economic, sociocultural, technological, environmental and legal – exert on a business to later chart its long term targets.
Being part of the external analysis when carrying out a strategic assessment or performing a market study, PESTEL gives an overview of diverse macro-environmental factors that any company should thoughtfully consider. By perceiving these outside environments, businesses can maximally benefit from the opportunities while minimizing the threats to the organization.
Key Factors Examined by PESTEL Analysis:

Political – What opportunities and pressures are brought by political bodies and what is the degree of public regulations’ impact on the business?
Economic – What economic policies, trends and structures are expected to affect the organization, what is this influence’s degree?
Sociological – What cultural and societal aspects will work upon the demand for the business’s products and operations?
Technological – What impact do the technological aspects, innovations, incentives and barriers have on the organization?
Environmental – What environmental and ecological facets, both locally and farther afield, are likely to predetermine the business?
Legal – What laws and legislation will exert influence on the style the business is carried out?


IFE, EFE, IE Matrices
The Internal Factor Evaluation matrix (IFE matrix) is a strategic management tool helping audit or evaluate major weaknesses and strengths in a business’s functional areas. In addition, IFE matrix serves as a basis for identifying and assessing relationships amongst those areas. The IFE matrix is utilised in strategy formulation.
The External Factor Evaluation matrix (EFE matrix) is a tool of strategic management that is typically utilised to assess current market conditions. It is an ideal instrument for visualising and prioritising the threats and opportunities a firm is facing.
The essential difference between the above mentioned matrices lies in the type of factors incorporated in the model; whilst the latter is engaged in internal factors, the former deals exceptionally with external factors – those exposed to social, political, economic, legal, etc. external forces. 
Being a continuation of the EFE matrix and IFE matrix models, the Internal External matrix (IE matrix) rests upon an investigation of external and internal business factors integrated into one suggestive model. 

Porter Five Forces Analysis
The Porter’s five forces analysis studies the industry of operation and helps the company find new sources of competitive advantage. The analysis surveys an industry through five major questions:

What composes a threat of substitute products and services?
Is there a threat of new competitors entering the market?
What is the intensity of competitive rivalry?
How big is the bargaining power of buyers?
How significant is the bargaining power of suppliers?


VRIO Analysis
VRIO stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization. This analysis helps to evaluate all company’s resources and capabilities and bring them together into one aggregate table that includes:

Tangible resources
Financial
Physical
Technological
Organizational

Intangible resources
Human
Innovation and Creativity
Reputation

Organizational capabilities

The result of the analysis gives a clear picture of company’s competitive and economic implications, answering the questions if the resources mentioned above are:

Valuable?
Rare? 
Costly to imitate? 
Organized properly?

EMRISE Receives Initial Production Order For International Military Aircraft Power Supply Products 


Rancho Cucamonga, CA - EMRISE CORPORATION recently announced it has received an initial $300,000 production order from a military systems integrator for power supplies and control system sub-assemblies for use in a new international, fixed-wing, military aircraft program. The company anticipates receiving multiple follow-on production orders associated with this project which could span multiple years and could provide millions of dollars of additional business for EMRISE. 
This initial production order, which is for immediate delivery, is a direct follow-on order from an $850,000 development contract awarded in mid-2007 to the Company's Pascall Electronics Ltd. ("Pascall") subsidiary in England. 
Carmine T. Oliva, President and CEO of EMRISE, commented, "Our Pascall subsidiary has had significant success in recent months in expanding its primary commercial business from In-Flight Entertainment and Communications (IFC&E) products into the harsh environment, military market for custom and commercial ‘off the shelf' power supplies and control sub-assemblies. 
 "In 2007, we implemented our strategy of extending Pascall's commercial expertise into custom military programs that were more typical of our Xcel Power Systems, Ltd. ('XPS') subsidiary in England, whose business is predominantly military especially for the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft," Oliva added. "We believe the award of this production order is continuing evidence of the synergy between XPS and Pascall and it clearly demonstrates Pascall's ability to meet challenging military development requirements within tight time frames and to ultimately be awarded follow-on production orders for potential multi-year, multi-million dollar programs." 
Pascall and XPS continue to capitalize on their long-standing presence in the fixed and rotary wing aircraft market. Recent orders show the penetration that Pascall and XPS, and EMRISE's U.S.-based power supply subsidiary RO Associates, are achieving by capturing business in the larger programs for land-based military vehicles, including the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV or Humvee), tracked vehicles, and tanks.

DURHAM, N.C., Aug. 21, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- EMRISE CORPORATION (OTCBB: EMRI), a multi-national manufacturer of defense and aerospace electronic devices and communications equipment, announced today that it has launched a strategically important new network access product and received its first order for the product valued at approximately $360,000 (€290,000) from a large public utility in Europe.  The prototype of this new product was delivered to this customer earlier in 2012 and EMRISE expects to begin deliveries of this production order for the new product in the fourth quarter of 2012.  
The order was received by the Company's CXR Anderson Jacobson (CXR-AJ) subsidiary located in France.  CXR-AJ develops and sells a wide range of communications equipment.
EMRISE Chief Executive Carmine T. Oliva said this order is a direct result of the Company's execution of its strategy to increase its penetration of the utilities markets in Europe and the United States.  He also noted that management believes this particular order for a new customized network access product for a large European public utility is evidence of continuing strength in this important and growing market. 
"This new network access product can readily be adapted to meet the specific needs of other public utilities in Europe and in North America," Oliva added.  "And, it is because of its adaptability that we expect it will become a strategically important addition to our overall product range for the utilities market."  
The new network access product is based on a technology that is parallel to the Company's recently released CIP-All product that has been qualified by a dominant European telecommunications company and a major European-based international utility company for use in their enterprise network applications.  
"We believe these recent customer qualifications of CIP-All and the release of this new product will enhance our ability to generate orders and further penetrate the utilities markets in Europe and the United States, which is a major focus of our Communications Equipment business," Oliva said.
