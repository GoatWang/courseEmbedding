KATHI P. SEIFERT, KIMBERLY-CLARK CORP.
Strategic Team Leader Takes on the World


	By  

Jack Neff.
	

	
	
 Published on February 08, 1999. 







		        Many women have assumed VP-level posts with U.S. package-goods companies, but Kathi P. Seifert, group president-global personal care products for Kimberly-Clark Corp., is one of the few to break into a top job heading a business sector globally.

Ms. Seifert, 49, was named in December to lead the team that manages global plans for branding and product positioning, research and development, capacity and capital investment for personal care products, including the Huggies, Pull-Ups, Kotex and Depends brands, which account for more than a third of the company's sales.

The new assignment is an extension of the duties she was awarded last year as group president-personal care products. Prior to that she was named group president-North American Products in 1995.

Ms. Seifert continues to head the North American unit with profit-loss responsibility for those businesses and oversees the company's U.S. and Canadian consumer sales forces.

"Our role as a strategic leadership team," Ms. Seifert says of her new global duties, "will really be to help accelerate sales and earnings growth, increase speed and efficiency of new products, accelerate learning around the world, and really try to identify best practices and distribute those as fast as possible to leaders around the world."

General Information


Why did I receive this proxy statement?
The board of directors of Eli Lilly and Company is soliciting proxies to be voted at the annual
meeting of shareholders (the annual meeting) to be held on Monday, April 18, 2005, and at any
adjournment of the annual meeting. When the company asks for your proxy, we must provide you with a
proxy statement that contains certain information specified by law.



What will the shareholders vote on at the annual meeting?
Eight items:





 
  
election of directors


 


 
  
ratification of the appointment of principal independent auditors


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal on separating the roles of chairman and chief executive officer


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal on importation of prescription drugs


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal requesting a report on the effect on the company of limiting product
supply to Canada


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal requesting periodic reports on the companys political contributions


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal on performance-based stock options


 


 
  
a shareholder proposal on animal testing.


Will there be any other items of business on the agenda?
We do not expect any other items of business because the deadline for shareholder proposals and
nominations has already passed. Nonetheless, in case there is an unforeseen need, the accompanying
proxy gives discretionary authority to the persons named on the proxy with respect to any other
matters that might be brought before the meeting. Those persons intend to vote that proxy in
accordance with their best judgment.


Who is entitled to vote?
Shareholders as of the close of business on February 15, 2005 (the record date), may vote at the
annual meeting. You have one vote for each share of common stock you held on the record date,
including shares:






  
held directly in your name as the shareholder of record


 


  
held for you in an account with a broker, bank, or other nominee


 


  
attributed to your account in the Lilly Employee Savings Plan (the savings plan).


What constitutes a quorum?
A majority of the outstanding shares, present or represented by proxy, constitutes a quorum for the
annual meeting. As of the record date, 1,132,720,819 shares of company common stock were issued and
outstanding.


How many votes are required for the approval of each item?
There are differing vote requirements for the various proposals.






 
  
The four nominees for director receiving the most votes will be elected. Abstentions and
instructions to withhold
authority to vote for one or more of the nominees will result in those nominees receiving fewer
votes but will not count as votes against a nominee.


 


 
  
The appointment of principal independent auditors will be approved if the votes cast
for the proposal exceed
those cast against the proposal. Abstentions will not be counted either for or against the
proposal.


 


 
  
The shareholder proposals will be approved if the votes cast for the proposal exceed
those cast against the
proposal. Abstentions and broker nonvotes will not be counted either for or against the
proposal.


Broker nonvotes. If your shares are held by a broker, the broker will ask you how you want your
shares to be voted. If you give the broker instructions, your shares will be voted as you direct.
If you do not give instructions, one of two things can happen, depending on the type of proposal.
For the election of directors and the ratification of auditors, the broker may vote your shares in
its discretion. For the shareholder proposals, the broker may not vote your shares at all. When
that happens, it is called a broker nonvote.


How do I vote by proxy?
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote your proxy by any one of the following methods.



3


 

By mail. Sign and date each proxy card you receive and return it in the prepaid envelope. Sign your
name exactly as it appears on the proxy. If you are signing in a representative capacity (for example, as an
attorney-in-fact, executor, administrator, guardian, trustee, or the officer or agent of a
corporation or partnership), please indicate your name and your title or capacity. If the stock is
held in custody for a minor (for example, under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act), the custodian
should sign, not the minor. If the stock is held in joint ownership, one owner may sign on behalf
of all owners. If you return your signed proxy but do not indicate your voting preferences, we will
vote on your behalf for the election of the four nominees for director listed below, for the
ratification of the appointment of the independent auditors, and against the shareholder proposals.


     Note that if you previously elected to receive these materials electronically, you did not
receive a proxy card. If you wish to vote by mail, rather than by telephone or on the Internet as
discussed below, you may request paper copies of these materials, including a proxy card, by
calling 317-433-5112 or by sending an e-mail message to annual_meeting@lilly.com. Please make sure
you give us the control number from the e-mail message that you received notifying you of the
electronic availability of these materials, along with your name and mailing address.


By telephone. Shareholders in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Canada may vote by telephone by
following the instructions on the enclosed proxy card or, if you received these materials
electronically, by following the instructions in the e-mail message that notified you of their
availability. Voting by telephone has the same effect as voting by mail. If you vote by telephone,
do not return your proxy card. Telephone voting will be available until 11:59 p.m. EDT (10:59 p.m.
Indianapolis time), April 17, 2005.


By Internet. You may vote online at www.proxyvote.com. Follow the instructions on the enclosed
proxy card or, if you received these materials electronically, the instructions in the e-mail
message that notified you of their availability. Voting on the Internet has the same effect as
voting by mail. If you vote on the Internet, do not return your proxy card. Internet voting will be
available until 11:59 p.m. EDT (10:59 p.m. Indianapolis time), April 17, 2005.


You have the right to revoke your proxy at any time before the meeting by (1) notifying the
companys secretary in writing or (2) delivering a later-dated proxy by telephone, on the Internet,
or in writing. If you are a shareholder of record, you may also revoke your proxy by voting in
person at the meeting.


How do I vote shares that are held by my broker?
If you have shares held by a broker or other nominee, you may instruct your broker or other
nominee to vote your shares by following instructions that the broker or nominee provides for you.
Most brokers offer voting by mail, telephone, and on the Internet.


How do I vote in person?
If you are a shareholder of record, you may vote your shares in person at the meeting.
However, we encourage you to vote by proxy card, by telephone, or on the Internet even if you
plan to attend the meeting.


How do I vote my shares in the Savings Plan?
You may instruct the plan trustee on how to vote your shares in the savings plan by mail, by
telephone, or on the Internet as described above, except that, if you vote by mail, the card that
you use will be a voting instruction card rather than a proxy card.


How many shares in the Savings Plan can I vote?
You may vote all the shares allocated to your account on the record date. In addition, unless
you decline, your vote will also apply to a proportionate number of other shares held in the plan
for which voting directions are not received. These undirected shares include:






 
  
shares credited to the accounts of participants who do not return their voting
instructions (except for a
small number of shares from a prior stock ownership plan, which can be voted only on the
directions of the
participants to whose accounts the shares are credited)


 


 
  
shares held in the plan that are not yet credited to individual participants accounts.


      All participants are named fiduciaries under the terms of the savings plan and under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) for the limited purpose of voting shares credited
to their accounts and the portion of undirected shares to which their vote applies. Under ERISA,
fiduciaries are required to act prudently in making voting decisions.


      If you do not want to have your vote applied to the undirected shares, you should check the
box marked I decline. Otherwise, the trustee will automatically apply your voting preferences to
the undirected shares proportionally with all other participants who elected to have their votes applied in this manner.


4


 

What happens if I do not vote my Savings Plan shares?
Your shares will be voted by other plan participants who have elected to have their voting
preferences applied proportionally to all shares for which voting instructions are not otherwise
received.


What does it mean if I receive more than one proxy card?
It means that you hold shares in more than one account. To ensure that all your shares are voted,
sign and return each card. Alternatively, if you vote by telephone or on the Internet, you will
need to vote once for each proxy card and voting instruction card you receive.


Who tabulates the votes?
The votes are tabulated by an independent inspector of election, IVS Associates, Inc.


What should I do if I want to attend the annual meeting?
All shareholders as of the record date may attend by presenting the admission ticket that appears
at the end of this proxy statement. Please fill it out and bring it with you to the meeting. The
meeting will be held at the Lilly Center Auditorium. Please use the Lilly Center entrance to the
south of the fountain at the corner of Delaware and McCarty streets. You will need to pass through
security, including a metal detector. Present your ticket to the usher at the meeting.



      Parking will be available on a first-come, first-served basis in the garage indicated on the
map on page 41.


      If you have questions about admittance or parking, you may call 317-433-5112 or send an e-mail
message to annual_meeting@lilly.com.

Will the annual meeting be available on the Internet?
The annual meeting will be broadcast live via webcast on the companys website. To join the live
webcast, go to www.lilly.com and click on the annual meeting link that appears on the home page.
The webcast will be available in both the Windows Media Player
and RealPlayer® formats. It will be
available for replay on the Lilly website until May 18, 2005.


How do I contact the board of directors?
You can send written communications to one or more members of the board, addressed to:


Presiding Director, Board of Directors
Eli Lilly and Company
c/o Corporate Secretary
Lilly Corporate Center
Indianapolis, Indiana 46285

All such communications will be forwarded to the relevant director(s) except for solicitations
or other matters unrelated to the company.


How do I submit a shareholder proposal for the 2006 annual meeting?
The companys 2006 annual meeting is scheduled for April 17, 2006. If a shareholder wishes to have
a proposal considered for inclusion in next years proxy statement, he or she must submit the
proposal in writing so that we receive it by November 8, 2005. Proposals should be addressed to the
companys secretary, Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285. In addition, the
companys bylaws provide that any shareholder wishing to propose any other business at the annual
meeting must give the company written notice by November 8, 2005. That notice must provide certain
other information as described in the bylaws. Copies of the bylaws are available online at
http://investor.lilly.com/bylaws.cfm.


Does the company offer an opportunity to receive future proxy materials electronically?
Yes. If you are a shareholder of record or a member of the savings plan, you may, if you wish,
receive future proxy statements and annual reports online. If you elect this feature, you will
receive an e-mail message notifying you when the materials are available along with a web address
for viewing the materials and instructions for voting by telephone or on the Internet. If you have
more than one account, you may receive separate e-mail notifications for each account.

      You may sign up for electronic delivery in two ways.





 
  
If you vote online as described above, you may sign up for electronic delivery at that time.


 


 
  
You may sign up at any time by visiting http://proxyonline.lilly.com.


     If you received these materials electronically, you do not need to do anything to continue
receiving materials electronically in the future.


If you hold your shares in a brokerage account, you may also have the opportunity to receive
proxy materials electronically. Please follow the instructions of your broker.


What are the benefits of electronic delivery?
Electronic delivery reduces the companys printing and mailing costs. It is also a convenient way
for you to receive your proxy materials and makes it easy to vote your shares online. If you have
shares in more than one account, it is an easy way to avoid receiving duplicate copies of proxy
materials.


What are the costs of electronic delivery?
The company charges nothing for electronic delivery. You may, of course, incur the usual expenses
associated with Internet access, such as telephone charges or charges from your Internet service
provider.


May I change my mind later?
Yes. You may discontinue electronic delivery at any time. For more information, call 317-433-5112
or send an e-mail message to annual_meeting@lilly.com.


What is householding?
We have adopted householding, a procedure under which shareholders of record who have the same
address and last name and do not receive proxy materials electronically will receive only one copy
of our annual report and proxy statement unless one or more of these shareholders notifies us that
they wish to continue receiving individual copies. This procedure saves printing and postage costs
by reducing duplicative mailings.



      Shareholders who participate in householding will continue to receive separate proxy cards.
Householding will not affect dividend check mailings.


      Beneficial shareholders can request information about householding from their banks, brokers,
or other holders of record.

What if I want to receive a separate copy of the annual report and proxy statement?
If you participate in householding and wish to receive a separate copy of the 2004 annual report
and proxy statement, or if you wish to receive separate copies of future annual reports and proxy
statements, please call us at 317-433-5112 or write to: Householding Department, 51 Mercedes Way,
Edgewood, NY 11717. We will deliver the requested documents to you promptly upon your request.

Highlights of the Companys Corporate Governance Guidelines


The board of directors has established guidelines that it follows in matters of corporate
governance. The following summary provides highlights of those guidelines. A complete copy of the
guidelines is available online at http://investor.lilly.com/guidelines.cfm or in paper form upon
request to the companys secretary.



I. Role of the Board
The directors are elected by the shareholders to oversee the actions and results of the companys
management. Their responsibilities include:






 
  
providing general oversight of the business


 


 
  
approving corporate strategy and major management initiatives


 


 
  
providing oversight of legal and ethical conduct


 


 
  
nominating, compensating, and evaluating directors


 


 
  
evaluating board processes and performance


 


 
  
selecting, evaluating, compensating, and, when necessary, replacing the chief
executive officer and compensating other executive officers.


II. Composition of the Board
Mix of Independent Directors and Officer-Directors
There should always be a substantial majority (75 percent or more) of independent, nonemployee
directors. The chief executive officer should be a board member. Other officers may from time to
time be board members, but no officer other than the chief executive officer should expect to be
elected to the board by virtue of his or her office.



Selection of Director Candidates
The board is responsible for selecting candidates for board membership and for establishing the
criteria to be used in identifying potential candidates. The board delegates the screening process
to the directors and corporate governance committee. For more information on the director
nomination process, including the current selection criteria, see Directors and Corporate
Governance Committee Matters on pages 15-16.



Independence Determinations
The board annually determines the independence of directors based on a review by the directors and
corporate governance committee. No director is considered independent unless the board has
determined that he or she has no material relationship with the company, either directly or as a
partner, shareholder, or officer of an organization that has a material relationship with the
company. Material relationships can include commercial, industrial, banking, consulting, legal,
accounting, charitable, and familial relationships, among others. To evaluate the materiality of
any such relationship, the board has adopted categorical independence standards consistent with the
revised New York Stock Exchange listing guidelines adopted in November 2003 and amended in November
2004.



      Specifically, a director is not considered independent if (i) the director or an immediate
family member is a current partner of Lillys independent auditor (currently Ernst & Young LLP);
(ii) the director is a current employee of such firm; (iii) the director has an immediate family
member who is a current employee of such firm and who participates in the firms audit, assurance
or tax compliance (but not tax planning) practice; or (iv) the director or immediate family member
was within the last three years (but is no longer) a partner or employee of such firm and
personally worked on the listed companys audit within that time.


      In addition, a director is not considered independent if any of the following
relationships existed within the previous three years:





 
  
a director who is an employee of Lilly, or whose immediate family member is an executive
officer of Lilly.
Temporary service by an independent director as interim chairman or chief executive officer will not disqualify
the director from being independent following completion of that service.





 
  
a director who receives any direct compensation from Lilly other than the directors normal director
compensation, or whose immediate family member receives more than $100,000 per year in
direct
compensation from Lilly other than for service as a non-executive employee.


 


 
  
a director who is employed (or whose immediate family member is employed as an executive
officer) by another
company where any Lilly executive officer serves on that companys compensation committee.


 


 
  
a director who is employed by, who is a 10 percent shareholder of, or whose immediate
family member is an
executive officer of a company that makes payments to or receives payments from Lilly for
property or services
that exceed the greater of $1 million or 2 percent of that companys gross revenues in a single
fiscal year.


11
 



 




 
  
a director who is an executive officer of a nonprofit organization that receives grants or
contributions from Lilly
in a single fiscal year exceeding the greater of $1 million or 2 percent of that organizations
gross revenues in a
single fiscal year.


      Additionally, members of the audit, compensation, and directors and corporate governance
committees must meet all applicable independence tests of the New York Stock Exchange, Securities
and Exchange Commission, and Internal Revenue Service.


      The
board has determined that all 11 of the nonemployee directors listed
on pages 7-10 are
independent pursuant to the above criteria and that the board committee members meet all applicable
independence standards.


Director Tenure
Subject to the companys charter documents, the governance guidelines establish the following
expectations for director tenure:






 
  
Nonemployee directors will resign from the board effective at the annual meeting of
shareholders following their
seventy-second birthday. (Consistent with this policy, Dr. Beering will retire on April 18, 2005.)


 


 
  
Employee directors will resign from the board when they retire or otherwise cease to be active employees of the
company.


 


 
  
A nonemployee director who retires or changes principal job responsibilities will offer to resign from the board.
The directors and corporate governance committee will assess the situation and recommend to the board
whether to accept the resignation.


III. Director Compensation and Equity Ownership
The directors and corporate governance committee annually reviews board compensation. Any
recommendations for changes are made to the full board by the committee.



      Directors should hold meaningful equity ownership positions in the company; accordingly, a
significant portion of overall director compensation is in the form of company equity.


IV. Key Responsibilities of the Board
Selection of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Succession Planning
The board customarily combines the roles of chairman and chief executive officer, believing this
generally provides the most efficient and effective leadership model. The board recognizes that, in
certain occasional circumstances, such as leadership transition, it may be desirable to assign
these roles to two different persons for a relatively short period of time. The chair of the
compensation committee recommends to the board an appropriate process by which a new chairman and
chief executive officer will be selected depending on the circumstances at the time.



      The independent directors are responsible for overseeing succession planning. The chief
executive officer develops and maintains a process for advising the board on succession planning
for the chief executive officer and other key leadership positions. He or she reviews this plan
annually with the independent directors.


Evaluation of Chief Executive Officer
The chair of the compensation committee leads the independent directors annually in assessing the
performance of the chief executive officer. The results of this review are discussed with the chief
executive officer and considered by the compensation committee in establishing his or her
compensation for the next year.



Corporate Strategy
Once each year, the board, together with senior management, devotes an extended meeting to
discussing and providing direction for the corporate strategic plan. Throughout the year,
significant corporate strategy decisions are brought to the board for approval.



Code of Ethics
The board has approved the companys code of ethics, which complies with the requirements of the
New York Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission. This code is set forth in:






 
  
The Red Book, a comprehensive code of ethical and legal business conduct applicable to
all employees worldwide
and to our board of directors


 


 
  
the companys Code of Ethical Conduct for Lilly Financial Management, a supplemental code for our chief
executive officer and all members of financial management that recognizes the unique
responsibilities of those
individuals in assuring proper accounting, financial reporting, internal controls, and financial
stewardship.


12
 



 

      Both documents are available online at http://investor.lilly.com/code_business_conduct.cfm or
in paper form upon request to the companys secretary.


      The audit committee and public policy and compliance committee assist in the boards oversight
of compliance programs with respect to matters covered in the code of ethics.


V. Functioning of the Board
Executive Session of Directors
The independent directors meet alone in executive session after every regularly scheduled board
meeting. In addition, at least twice a year, the independent directors meet in executive session
with the chief executive officer.



Presiding Director
The chair of the compensation committee (currently Dr. Beering) leads the process for selecting and
evaluating the chief executive officer. The chair of the compensation committee also presides at
other executive sessions of independent directors unless the directors decide that, due to the
subject matter of the session, another independent director should preside. Following Dr. Beerings
retirement, Ms. Horn will replace him as chair of the compensation committee.



Conflicts of Interest
Occasionally a directors business or personal relationships may give rise to an interest that
conflicts, or appears to conflict, with the interests of the company. Directors must disclose to
the company all relationships that create a conflict or an appearance of a conflict. The board,
after consultation with counsel, takes appropriate steps to ensure that all directors voting on an
issue are disinterested. In appropriate cases, the affected director will be excused from
discussions on the issue.



      To avoid any appearance of a conflict, board decisions on certain matters of corporate
governance are made solely by the independent directors. These include executive compensation
and the selection, evaluation, and removal of the chief executive officer.


Orientation and Continuing Education
A comprehensive orientation process is in place for new directors. In addition, directors
receive ongoing continuing education through educational sessions at meetings, the annual strategy
retreat, and periodic mailings between meetings. We hold periodic mandatory training sessions for
the audit committee, to which other directors and executive officers are invited. We also afford
directors the opportunity to attend external director education programs.



Director Access to Management and Independent Advisers
Independent directors have direct access to members of management whenever they wish. In
addition, the independent directors and the committees are free to retain their own independent
advisers, at company expense, whenever they wish.



Assessment of Board Processes and Performance
The directors and corporate governance committee annually assesses the performance of the
board, its committees, and board processes based on inputs from all directors. The committee also
considers the contributions of individual directors at least every three years when considering
whether to recommend nominating the director to a new three-year term.



VI. Board Committees
Number, Structure, and Independence
The duties and membership of the six board-appointed committees are described below. Only
independent directors may serve on the audit, compensation, directors and corporate governance, and
public policy and compliance committees. All other committees must have a majority of independent
directors, and only independent directors may chair any committee.



      Committee membership and selection of committee chairs are recommended to the board by the
directors and corporate governance committee after consulting the chairman of the board and after
considering the desires of the board members.


Functioning of Committees
Each committee reviews its own charter annually, and the directors and corporate governance
committee reviews all committee charters annually. The board may form new committees or disband a
current committee (except the audit, compensation, and directors and corporate governance
committees) as appropriate. The chair of the committee determines the frequency, length, and agenda of committee meetings.

      All six committee charters are available online at

secretary.

Directors Compensation


Directors who are employees receive no additional compensation for serving on the board or
its committees.

In 2004, we provided the following annual compensation to directors who are not
employees:



Cash compensation



 
  
retainer of $3,750 per month


 


 
  
$1,600 for each board meeting attended (or $1,600 per day for multi-day meetings)


 


 
  
$1,600 for each committee or other meeting attended if not held on the same day as a board meeting


 


 
  
$2,000 to the committee chairpersons for each committee meeting attended as compensation for the
chairpersons preparation time


 


 
  
reimbursement for customary and usual travel expenses.


Stock Compensation



 
  
700 shares of Lilly stock in a deferred stock account in the Lilly Directors Deferral Plan (as described below),
payable after service on the board has ended.


 


 
  
Stock options under the 2002 Lilly Stock Plan for 2,800 shares of Lilly stock. The option price is the fair market
value at the time of grant. The options are exercisable after 3 years and expire after 10
years.


      In 2005, the cash compensation is unchanged. However, we have discontinued stock option grants
and instead will increase the deferred stock shares from 700 to 1,500.


Lilly Directors Deferral Plan
This plan allows directors to defer receipt of all or part of their retainer and meeting fees until
after their service on the board has ended. Each director can choose to invest the funds in either
of two accounts:






 
  
Deferred Compensation Account. Funds in this account earn interest each year at an annual
rate of 120 percent
of the applicable federal long-term rate as established for the preceding December by the U.S. Treasury
Department under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code with monthly compounding. The rate for
2005 is 5.5 percent. The aggregate amount of interest that accrued in 2004 for the participating directors was
$193,735.11 at a rate of 5.99 percent.


 


 
  
Deferred Share Account. This account allows the director, in effect, to invest his or her deferred cash
compensation in Lilly stock. In addition, the annual award of shares to each director noted
above (700 shares in
2004; 1,500 shares in 2005) is credited to this account. Funds in this account are credited as
hypothetical shares
of Lilly stock based on the market price of the stock at the time the compensation would
otherwise have been
earned. Hypothetical dividends are reinvested in additional shares based on the market price
of the stock on
the date dividends are paid. All shares in the deferred share accounts are hypothetical and are
not issued or
transferred until the director ends his or her service on the board or dies.


      Both accounts may be paid in a lump sum or in annual installments for up to 10 years. The
deferred compensation account may also be paid in monthly installments for up to 10 years. Amounts
in the deferred share account are paid in the form of shares of Lilly stock.


Directors and Corporate Governance Committee Matters



Overview
The directors and corporate governance committee recommends candidates for membership on the board
and board committees. The committee also oversees matters of corporate governance, director
independence, director compensation, and board performance. The committees charter is available
online at http://investor.lilly. com/board-committees.cfm or in paper form upon request to the
companys secretary.



      All committee members are independent as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing
requirements.


Director Nomination Process
The board seeks independent directors who represent a mix of backgrounds and experiences that will
enhance the quality of the boards deliberations and decisions. Candidates shall have substantial
experience with one or more



15
 



 

publicly traded national or multinational companies or shall have achieved a high level of
distinction in their chosen fields. Board membership should reflect diversity in its broadest
sense, including persons diverse in geography, gender, and ethnicity. The board is particularly
interested in maintaining a mix that includes the following backgrounds:






 
  
active or retired chief executive officers and senior executives, particularly those with
experience in operations,
finance/banking, and marketing/sales


 


 
  
international business


 


 
  
medicine and science


 


 
  
government and public policy


 


 
  
information technology.


      The board delegates the screening process to the directors and corporate governance committee,
which receives direct input from other board members. Potential candidates are identified by
recommendations from several sources, including:





 
  
incumbent directors


 


 
  
management


 


 
  
shareholders


 


 
  
an independent executive search firm retained by the committee to assist in locating
candidates meeting the
boards selection criteria.


      The committee employs the same process for evaluating all candidates, including those
submitted by shareholders. The committee initially evaluates the candidate based on publicly
available information and any additional information supplied by the party recommending the
candidate. If the candidate appears to satisfy the selection criteria and the committees initial
evaluation is favorable, the committee, assisted by management, gathers additional data on the
candidates qualifications, availability, probable level of interest, and any potential conflicts
of interest. If the committees subsequent evaluation continues to be favorable, the candidate is
contacted by the chairman of the board and one or more of the independent directors for direct
discussions to determine the mutual levels of interest in pursuing the candidacy. If these
discussions are favorable, the committee makes a final recommendation to the board to nominate the
candidate for election by the shareholders (or to select the candidate to fill a vacancy, as
applicable).


      Sir John Rose, who is standing for election at this annual meeting of shareholders, was
referred to the company by an independent executive search firm.


Process for Submitting Recommendations and Nominations
A shareholder who wishes to recommend a director candidate for evaluation by the committee pursuant
to this process should forward the candidates name and information about the candidates
qualifications to the chairman of the directors and corporate governance committee, in care of the
corporate secretary, at Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285. The candidate must
meet the selection criteria described above and must be willing and expressly interested in serving
on the board.



      Under Section 1.9 of the companys bylaws, a shareholder who wishes to directly nominate a
director candidate at the 2006 annual meeting (i.e., to propose a candidate for election who is not
otherwise nominated by the board through the recommendation process described above) must give the
company written notice by November 8, 2005. The notice should be addressed to the corporate
secretary at Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285. The notice must contain
prescribed information about the candidate and about the shareholder proposing the candidate as
described in more detail in Section 1.9 of the bylaws. A copy of the bylaws is available online at
http://investor.lilly.com/bylaws.cfm. The bylaws will also be provided by mail without charge upon
request to the corporate secretary.


Audit Committee Matters



Audit Committee Membership
All members of the audit committee are independent as defined in both the New York Stock Exchange
listing standards and the Securities and Exchange Commission standards applicable to audit
committee members. The board of directors has determined that Sir Winfried Bischoff and Mr. J.
Michael Cook are audit committee financial experts as defined in the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The board has also determined that Mr. Cooks service on more than three
public company audit committees does not impair his ability to serve on our audit committee.



16
 



 

Audit Committee Report
The audit committee reviews the companys financial reporting process on behalf of the board.
Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process,
including the systems of internal controls and disclosure controls. In this context, we have met
and held discussions with management and the independent auditors. Management represented to us
that the companys consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, and we have reviewed and discussed the audited financial statements
and related disclosures with management and the independent auditors, including a review of the
significant management judgments underlying the financial statements and disclosures.



      The independent auditors report to us and to the board. We have sole authority to appoint
(subject to shareholder ratification) and to terminate the engagement of the independent auditors.


      We have discussed with the independent auditors matters required to be discussed by Statement
on Auditing Standards No. 61 (Communication With Audit Committees), including the quality, not just
the acceptability, of the accounting principles, the reasonableness of significant judgments, and
the clarity of the disclosures in the financial statements. In addition, we have received the
written disclosures and the letter from the independent auditors required by the Independence
Standards Board Standard No. 1 (Independence Discussions With Audit Committees) and have discussed
with the independent auditors the auditors independence from the company and its management. In
concluding that the auditors are independent, we determined, among other things, that the nonaudit
services provided by Ernst & Young (as described below) were compatible with their independence.
Consistent with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we have adopted additional
policies to ensure the independence of the independent auditors, such as prior committee approval
of nonaudit services and required audit partner rotation.


      We discussed with the companys internal and independent auditors the overall scope and plans
for their respective audits including internal control testing under Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We periodically meet with the internal and independent auditors, with and
without management present, to discuss the results of their examinations, their evaluations of the
companys internal controls, and the overall quality of the companys financial reporting. We also
periodically meet in executive session.


      In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, we recommended to the board (and
the board subsequently approved the recommendation) that the audited financial statements be
included in the companys annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2004, for
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We have also appointed the companys
independent auditors, subject to shareholder ratification for 2005.

Services Performed by the Independent Auditor
The audit committee preapproves all audit and nonaudit services performed by the independent
auditor in order to assure that the provision of such services does not impair the auditors
independence. The committees policy and procedures are as follows:






 
  
All audit services must be preapproved by the committee. The committee approves the
annual audit services
engagement and, if necessary, any changes in terms, conditions, and fees resulting from changes
in audit scope,
company structure, or other matters. The committee may also grant preapproval for other audit
services, which
are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide. Beginning in 2004,
audit services
include internal controls attestation work under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.


 


 
  
Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to
the performance of
the audit, and that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. The committee
believes that the
provision of these services does not impair the independence of the auditor. All audit-related
services must be
preapproved by the committee.


 


 
  
All tax services must be separately preapproved by the committee. The committee believes
that, in appropriate
cases, the independent auditor can provide tax compliance services, tax planning, and tax advice without
impairing the auditors independence.


 


 
  
Nonaudit services classified as all other services must be separately preapproved by the committee. The
committee may approve such services if (i) the services are permissible under SEC rules, (ii)
the committee believes the provision of the services would not impair the independence of the auditor, and
(iii) management believes that the auditor is the best choice to provide the service.


17
 



 




 
  
Process. At the beginning of each audit year, management requests prior committee
approval of the annual audit, statutory audits, and quarterly reviews for the upcoming audit
year as well as any other engagements known at that time. Management will also present at
that time an estimate of all fees for the upcoming audit year. As specific engagements are
identified thereafter, they are brought forward to the committee for approval. To the extent
approvals are required between regularly scheduled committee meetings, preapproval authority
is delegated to the committee chair.


      For each engagement, management provides the committee with information about the services
and fees sufficiently detailed to allow the committee to make an informed judgment about the
nature and scope of the services and the potential for the services to impair the independence of
the auditor.


      After the end of the audit year, management provides the committee with a summary of the
actual fees incurred for the completed audit year.


Independent Auditor Fees
The following table shows the fees incurred for services rendered on a worldwide basis by Ernst &
Young LLP, the companys independent auditor, in 2004 and 2003. All such services were
preapproved by the committee in accordance with the preapproval policy.

Executive Compensation



Compensation Committee Report
The following is a report of the compensation committee of the board regarding executive
compensation. The committees membership and duties are
described on page 14.



Executive Compensation Policy
Philosophy. The compensation committee bases its executive compensation policy on the same
principles that guide the company in establishing all its compensation programs. We design programs
to attract, retain, and motivate highly talented individuals at all levels of the organization. In
particular:






 
  
We base compensation on the level of job responsibility, individual performance, and
company performance.
As employees progress to higher levels in the organization, an increasing proportion of their pay is linked to
company performance and shareholder returns.


 


 
  
We reflect in our compensation the value of the job in the marketplace. To attract and retain a highly skilled work
force, we must remain competitive with the pay of other premier employers who compete with us for talent.


 


 
  
We develop and administer our compensation programs to foster the long-term focus required for success in our
industry.


      The program consists of both annual and long-term components, which are considered together in
assessing whether the program is attaining its objectives.


18
 



 

Methodology. We consider various measures of company and industry performance, including sales,
earnings per share, total market value, and total shareholder return. These data assist us in
exercising judgment in establishing total compensation ranges. We do not assign these performance
measures relative weights. Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering all such
measures collectively.



      We also compare, or benchmark, our programs with other global pharmaceutical companies of
comparable size and stature to the company. For this benchmarking, we use the peer group identified
on page 26. We compare the executive compensation programs as a whole, and we also compare the pay
of individual executives if we believe the jobs are sufficiently similar to make the comparison
meaningful.


      We use the peer group data primarily to ensure that the executive compensation program as a
whole is within the broad middle range of comparative pay of the peer group companies when the
company achieves the targeted performance levels. We do not target a specific position in the range
of comparative data for each individual or for each component of compensation. We establish
individual amounts in view of the comparative data and such other factors as level of
responsibility, prior experience, and our judgment as to individual performance. We do not apply
formulas or assign these factors specific mathematical weights; instead, we exercise judgment and
discretion.


      We also retain an independent compensation consultant to assist us in evaluating our executive
compensation programs and in setting our chief executive officers compensation. The consultant
reports directly to the committee. The use of an independent consultant provides additional
assurance that our programs are reasonable and consistent with the companys objectives.


Components of Executive Compensation for 2004
Annual Compensation. Annual cash compensation for 2004 consisted of base salary and a cash bonus.






 
  
We determined base salaries based on company and individual performance for the previous year, internal
relativity, and market conditions, including pay at the peer group companies. As noted above, we used the
peer group and other market data to test for reasonableness and competitiveness of base salaries, but we
also exercised subjective judgment in view of our compensation objectives. Our merit budget processes for
executives are no different from those used for all employees.


 


 
  
Cash bonuses for all management employees worldwide, as well as most non-management employees in the
U.S, were determined under the Eli Lilly and Company Bonus Plan, a shareholder-approved
formula-based
bonus plan adopted in 2004. Under the plan, bonus target amounts, expressed as a percentage of
base salary,
are established for participants each year based on job responsibilities. Bonus payouts for the
year are then
determined by the companys performance relative to predetermined goals that are based 25
percent on sales
growth and 75 percent on earnings per share growth (adjusted for unusual items). In
establishing the company
performance measures, we considered the expected performance of Lilly and the other companies
in our peer
group. For the executive officers, we established bonus targets based on job responsibilities,
internal relativity,
and peer group data. Our objective was to set bonus targets such that total annual cash
compensation was
within the broad middle range of peer group companies and a substantial portion of that
compensation was
linked to company performance. Under the plan formula, payouts can range from zero to 200
percent of target
depending on company performance. While the company achieved good growth in both sales and
adjusted
earnings per share in 2004, the results were somewhat below the predetermined goals, and
therefore the
bonuses paid for 2004 were 90 percent of target.


Long-Term Incentives. We normally employ two forms of long-term equity incentives granted under the
2002 Lilly Stock Plan: stock options and performance awards. These incentives foster the long-term
perspective necessary for continued success in our business. They also ensure that our leaders are
properly focused on shareholder value. Our objective is to have a combined grant value of stock
options and performance awards that is competitive within the broad middle range of peer company
long-term incentive grant amounts. Stock options and performance awards have traditionally been
granted broadly and deeply within the organization, with approximately 4,950 management and
professional employees now participating.






 
  
Stock options align employee incentives with shareholders because options have value only
if the stock
price increases over time. Our 10-year options, granted at the market price on the date of
grant, ensure
that employees are focused on long-term growth. In addition, options help retain key employees
because
they typically cannot be exercised for three years and, if not exercised, are forfeited if the
employee leaves
the company before retirement. The three-year vesting also helps keep employees focused on
long-term
performance. In determining the size of option grants, we consider job responsibility,
individual performance,
peer group data, and the number of options previously granted. Generally, we granted stock
options in 2004 in
amounts the same as the previous year. The increase for
Mr. Taurel is discussed on page 21, and
the increases for Drs. Lechleiter and Paul are a result of their promotions.


19
 



 




 
  
Performance awards provide employees with shares of Lilly stock if certain company
performance goals are
achieved. The awards, normally granted annually, are structured as a schedule of shares of
Lilly stock based
on the companys achievement of specific earnings-per-share (EPS) levels over specified time
periods of
one or more years. We granted performance awards for 2004 with possible payouts ranging from
zero to 200
percent of the target amount, depending on 2004 EPS growth as adjusted based on predetermined
criteria. In
establishing the company performance measures, we considered the expected performance of Lilly
and the
other companies in our peer group. In determining the size of the grants, we considered job
responsibility,
individual performance, peer group data, and the size of performance awards previously granted.
Generally,
the award sizes were the same as the previous year, except in the case of promotions. Actual
adjusted EPS
performance for 2004 resulted in a payout of 100 percent of target. For executive officers, the
payout was in the
form of restricted stock, as noted below.


 


 
  
2005 long-term incentive grants were made by the committee on February 11, 2005. We
maintained our two-part, long-term incentive award but increased our emphasis on performance awards and decreased
emphasis
on stock options. In addition, we lowered overall grant values significantly, consistent with
marketplace trends,
while maintaining broad-based employee participation.


 


 
  
Share retention guidelines help foster a focus on long-term growth. We expect our
executive officers to retain all
net shares received from stock options and performance awards, net of taxes, for at least one
year. Consistent
with this objective, performance award shares earned for 2004 performance were issued in the
form of
restricted stock that is subject to forfeiture if the executive leaves the company prior to
February 2006, except in
the case of death, disability, retirement, or by consent of the committee.


Deductibility Cap on Executive Compensation. Under U.S. federal income tax law, the company cannot
take a tax deduction for certain compensation paid in excess of $1 million to the five executive
officers listed below. However, performance-based compensation, as defined in the tax law, is fully
deductible if the programs are approved by shareholders and meet other requirements. Our policy is
to qualify our incentive compensation programs for full corporate deductibility to the extent
feasible and consistent with our overall compensation goals. The company has taken steps to qualify
compensation under the Eli Lilly and Company Bonus Plan, as well as stock options and performance
awards under its management stock plans, for full deductibility as performance-based
compensation. We may make payments that are not fully deductible if, in our judgment, such
payments are necessary to achieve our compensation objectives and to protect shareholder interests.


Adjustments for Unusual Items. Consistent with past practice and based on predetermined criteria,
we adjusted the earnings results on which 2004 bonuses and performance awards were determined to
eliminate the effect of certain unusual items. The adjustments are intended to ensure that award
payments represent the underlying growth of the core business and are not artificially inflated or
deflated due to such unusual items either in the award year or the previous (comparator) year. For
the 2004 awards calculation, we adjusted EPS to eliminate the effect in both 2003 and 2004 of major
asset impairments, restructuring and other special charges, acquired in-process research charges,
as well as a one-time tax expense for the expected repatriation of earnings under the American Jobs
Creation Act in 2004, and a one-time gain on a technology licensing transaction in 2003.


Other Compensation. In 2003 and 2004, we undertook a total executive compensation review with the
guidance of our independent consultant. In addition to the primary compensation elements of salary,
cash bonuses, and long-term incentives discussed above, we reviewed the deferred compensation
program, other annual compensation, and payments that would be required under various severance and
change-in-control scenarios. We determined that these elements of compensation were reasonable in
the aggregate. Following our review, we recommended to the board, and it approved, amendments to
the deferred compensation and change-in-control severance pay programs that modestly reduced the
future benefit levels under those programs.



Chief Executive Officer Compensation for 2004
In establishing Mr. Taurels compensation for 2004, we applied the principles outlined above
in the same manner as they were applied to the other executives. We compared company performance
with that of the peer group companies, including EPS growth, economic value added, market value
added, and total shareholder return. We did not assign these performance measures relative weights
but rather made a subjective determination after considering the data collectively. In addition,
consistent with our annual process, in an executive session including all independent directors, we
assessed Mr. Taurels 2003 performance. We considered the companys and Mr. Taurels



20
 



 

accomplishment of objectives that had been established at the beginning of the year and our own
subjective assessment of his performance. We noted that under Mr. Taurels leadership the company
achieved strong 14 percent sales growth and met external earnings expectations despite significant
investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing. In addition,
during the year the company successfully launched three major products (Strattera, Forteo, and
Cialis) and made substantial progress in its comprehensive manufacturing improvement plan, clearing
the way for several product approvals in 2004. Mr. Taurel also led important initiatives to improve
the companys productivity and reduce its cost structure to enable it to continue to compete in an
increasingly challenging business environment.



      In recognition of his continued strong leadership in 2003, we increased Mr. Taurels annual
salary by 5 percent to $1.52 million effective April 2004. Mr. Taurels 2004 target bonus remained
at 110 percent of his base salary. As previously discussed under Cash bonuses, the actual payout
of $1.45 million was below target.


      Our review of peer group data available in late 2003 suggested that Mr. Taurels total equity
compensation in 2003 was significantly below the median. Based on his individual performance and
our review of the peer group data, we increased his stock option grant from 350,000 shares to
400,000 shares. The option shares vest after three years and expire after 10 years. We granted Mr.
Taurel a performance award to be earned based on 2004 EPS growth, with a target payout of 28,000
shares, the same size as the previous year. As discussed under Performance awards above, the
performance award paid out at 100 percent of target and, for executive officers, including Mr.
Taurel, was paid in the form of restricted stock.


      Effective February 11, 2005 consistent with our annual practice, we granted Mr. Taurel and
other members of management equity awards under the long-term incentive program previously
described . Mr. Taurels award consisted of a stock option grant of 255,621 shares and a
performance award with a target payout of 51,752 shares, which, if earned, will be paid out in
restricted stock. The combined value of these awards at the time of grant was $7.2 million using
the companys trinomial lattice method of 30.37 percent of the option price and a stock price of
$55.65 to value the award.


      In determining the size of the stock option and performance award grants for both years, we
took into consideration Mr. Taurels individual performance, internal relativity, peer group data,
and the size of grants previously made to Mr. Taurel. As noted above, in 2005 we adjusted the mix
of awards to increase emphasis on performance awards and decrease emphasis on stock options.


Conclusion
The committee and the board believe that the caliber and motivation of all our employees, and
especially our executive leadership, are essential to the companys performance. We believe our
management compensation programs contribute to our ability to differentiate our performance from
others in the marketplace. We will continue to evolve and administer our compensation program in a
manner that we believe will be in shareholders interests and worthy of shareholder support.

No stock appreciation rights were granted during the years indicated.

For 2004, represents the individuals earned bonus under the Eli Lilly and Company Bonus
Plan, based on the
companys actual growth in sales and adjusted earnings per share for the year. For 2003,
represents a one-time
discretionary bonus equivalent to 75 percent of the individuals normal bonus target under the
companys prior
bonus plan, the EVA® Bonus Plan. For 2002, represents the individuals declared bonus under the
EVA Bonus
Plan, which was zero due to company performance.


 


(3)  
Amounts in this column represent primarily above-market interest on deferred compensation and
tax reimbursements on personal use of the corporate aircraft. Beginning in 2004, the deferred
compensation program
was revised to provide for interest at a rate that is considered a market rate under Securities
and Exchange
Commission proxy reporting rules, 120 percent of the applicable federal long-term rate (6.16
percent in 2004).


     For Mr. Taurel, the amounts include the companys incremental cost to provide company aircraft to him for his personal
travel, as follows: 2004, $41,050; 2003, $90,678; and 2002, $94,044. Under board policy, for security reasons Mr. Taurel must
generally use the company-owned aircraft for both business and personal travel.



     In past proxy statements, we reported personal use of company aircraft
using the Standard Industry Fare Level (SIFL) tables published by the
Internal Revenue Service. The SIFL tables are used to determine the amount
of compensation income that is imputed to the executive for tax purposes for
personal use of corporate aircraft. Beginning with this proxy statement, for
all three years in the table, we are using a revised methodology that
calculates the incremental cost to the company based on the cost of fuel,
trip-related maintenance, crew travel expenses, on-board catering, landing
fees, trip-related hangar/parking costs and smaller variable costs. Since
the company-owned aircraft are used primarily for business travel, we do not
include the fixed costs that do not change based on usage, such as pilots
salaries, the purchase costs of the company-owned aircraft, and the cost of
maintenance not related to trips.



     For this table we have recalculated the incremental cost of personal use
of company-owned aircraft for all named executives in the previously
reported years 2003 and 2002 using the new methodology. For executives other
than Mr. Taurel, the recalculation did not change the reported amounts of
other annual compensation as prescribed by the SEC reporting rules. For Mr.
Taurel, the recalculation increased his reported amounts for both years. For
2003, his reported amount in this column was originally $126,561, with
$78,867 attributable to personal use of the corporate aircraft. For 2002,
his reported amount in this column was $57, 299, with his personal use of
the corporate aircraft falling below the SEC reporting thresholds.



     Beginning in 2005, the company and Mr. Taurel have entered into a time-sharing
arrangement under which he will pay the company a time-share fee for the use of
the aircraft for personal flights. See page 25.

All eligible global management received a payout of shares of Lilly stock under the
performance award program based on earnings per share growth in 2004. For most management employees, the payout was in
the
form of freely tradeable shares. However, consistent with our stock retention guidelines for
executive offi-


22
 



 




   
cers, the payout for executive officers was in the form of restricted stock that vests on
February 1, 2006. Mr. Taurel received 28,000 shares; Dr. Lechleiter received 14,000 shares; Mr.
Golden received 9,000 shares; Dr. Paul received 9,000 shares, and Mr. Armitage received 5,600
shares. The table reflects the value of the shares awarded, based on the stock price of $56.79,
the average of the high and low price of stock on January 14, 2005, the day the restricted shares
were issued. Dividends will be paid on the restricted shares. In addition to the restricted shares awarded from the performance award payout, Dr. Paul held 8,000 shares of restricted stock
valued at $454,000, as of December 31, 2004, and Mr. Armitage held 5,000 shares of restricted
stock valued at $283,750, as of December 31, 2004.

During the 2002 calendar year, Mr. Taurel chose to accept an annual salary of $1.00 as a
reflection of his confidence in, and commitment to, the company during a period of transition. Under normal
circumstances, his
annual base salary would have been $1,391,100 for 2002.

(1)  
No stock appreciation rights were granted in 2004.


 


(2)  
Options are granted at the market price of company common stock on the date of grant. Options
are exercisable
three years after their grant date.


 


(3)  
These values were established using the Black-Scholes stock option valuation model,
consistent with the model
used for our 2004 financial reporting. Assumptions used to calculate the grant date present value
of option shares granted during 2004 were in accordance with SFAS 123 as follows:





 
(a)  
Expected VolatilityThe standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of
return calculated on
the average daily stock price over a period of time immediately preceding the grant and equal
in length to the
expected life. The volatility was 35.20 percent.


 


 
(b)  
Risk-Free Interest RateThe rate available at the time the grant was made on
zero-coupon U.S. government
issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life. The risk-free interest rate was 3.42
percent.


 


 
(c)  
Dividend YieldThe expected dividend yield was 1.50 percent based on the historical
dividend yield over a
period of time immediately preceding the grant date equal in length to the expected life of
the grant.


 


 
(d)  
Expected LifeThe expected life of the grant was seven years, calculated based on the
historical expected
life of previous grants.


 


 
(e)  
Forfeiture RateUnder SFAS 123, forfeitures may be estimated or assumed to be zero.
The forfeiture rate
was assumed to be zero, based on the immateriality of actual calculated forfeiture rates.

The named executive officers will, upon retirement, be eligible for benefits under The Lilly
Retirement Plan (retirement plan). The above table sets forth a range of annual retirement benefits
for various levels of average annual earnings and years of service, assuming the employee retires
at age 65 with a 50 percent survivor income benefit. The retirement plan benefits shown in the
table are generally paid as a monthly annuity for the life of the retiree. The amounts shown in the
table are not subject to reduction for Social Security benefits or any other offset amounts except
that the ultimate pension benefits for Mr. Golden will be reduced by the amount of the pension
payments he receives from his previous employer. The annual benefit under the plan is calculated
using the average of the annual earnings for the highest 5 out of the last 10 years of service
(average annual earnings). Annual earnings covered by the retirement plan consist of salary, bonus,
and, for years prior to 2004, long-term incentive plan payouts as set forth in the Summary
Compensation Table on page 22 but calculated for the amount of bonus paid (rather than credited)
and for the year in which earnings are paid (rather than earned or credited). For purposes of
determining the annual benefit under the retirement plan shown in the table:

Mr. Golden received additional service credit when be began his employment in 1996. His
retirement benefits will include the standard retiree medical benefits that would be available to
retirees of the same age and with the same number of years of service credited. Dr. Paul, who
joined the company in 1993, will receive additional service credit if he remains employed by the
company past age 60. His retirement benefit will not be reduced for early retirement. This
additional service credit is included in the table above. When Mr. Armitage joined the company in
1999, the company agreed to provide him with a retirement benefit based on his actual years of
service and earnings at age 60. Mr. Armitage will be eligible to retire under the retirement plan
at age 61.



      Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) generally places a limit of $170,000 on the
amount of annual pension benefits that may be paid at age 65 from a plan such as the retirement
plan. Under an unfunded plan adopted in 1975, however, the company will make payments as permitted
by the Code to any employee who is a participant in the retirement plan in an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the benefits that would have been payable under the plan without regard
to the limitations imposed by the Code and the actual benefits payable under the plan as so
limited.


Change-in-Control Severance Pay Arrangements
The company has adopted a Change-in-Control Severance Pay Program (program) covering most employees
of the company and its subsidiaries, including the companys executive officers. In general, the
program would provide severance payments and benefits for eligible employees and executive officers
in the event their employment is terminated under certain circumstances within fixed periods of
time following a change in control. A change in control would occur if 15 percent or more of the
companys voting stock were acquired by an entity other than the company, a subsidiary, an employee
benefit plan of the company, or Lilly Endowment, Inc. There are additional conditions that could
result in a change-in-control event. The program may not be amended by the board, whether prior to
or following a change in control, in any manner adverse to a participant without his or her prior
written consent.



      Under the portion of the program covering the named executive officers, each would be entitled
to severance payments and benefits in the event that his or her employment is terminated following
a change in control (i) without cause by the company or (ii) for good reason by the executive
officer, each as is defined in the program. In such case, the executive officer would be entitled
to a severance payment equal to three times his or her current annual cash compensation. Additional
benefits would include a pension supplement and full and immediate vesting of all stock options and
other equity incentives. In the event that any payments made or benefits realized in connection
with the change in control would be subject to the excise tax imposed under Section 4999 of the
Internal Revenue Code as a result of the aggregate compensation payments and benefits made to the
individual, under the program or otherwise, the company would cover the cost of the excise tax.


Related Transaction
As noted above, under board policy, for security reasons Mr. Taurel must generally use the company
aircraft for all travel. Beginning in 2005, the company has entered into a time-share arrangement
with Mr. Taurel in connection with his personal use of company aircraft. Under the time-share
agreement, Mr. Taurel will lease the company aircraft, including crew and flight services, for
personal flights. He will pay a time-share fee based on the companys cost of the flight but capped
at the greater of (i) the Standard Industry Fare Levels as
discussed in footnote 3 on page 22 or
(ii) an amount equivalent to first-class airfare for the relevant flight (if such is commercially
available).

Performance Graph


This graph compares the return on Lilly stock with that of the Standard & Poors 500 Stock
Index and our peer group* for the years 2000 through 2004. The graph assumes that, on December 31,
1999, a person invested $100 each in Lilly stock, the S&P 500 Stock Index, and the peer groups
common stock. The graph measures total shareholder return, which takes into account both stock
price and dividends. It assumes that dividends paid by a company are reinvested in that companys
stock.

The following six proposals were submitted by shareholders. We will provide the names and addresses
of the proponents of these proposals, as well as the number of shares of Lilly stock owned by them,
upon request by phone at 317-433-5112, by e-mail at
annual   meeting@lilly.com, or in writing to the
companys secretary at Lilly Corporate Center, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285.



Item 3. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Separating the Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
Separating the Roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Resolved, The shareholders of Lilly (Eli) and Company (the Company) request the Board of
Directors establish a policy of, whenever possible, separating the roles of Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, so that an independent director who has not served as an executive officer of
the Company serves as Chair of the Board of Directors.



      This proposal shall not apply to the extent that complying would necessarily breach any
contractual obligations in effect at the time of the 2005 shareholder meeting.

Statement of Support: We believe in the principle of the separation of the roles of Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer. This is a basic element of sound corporate governance practice. In
addition, the lack of access to medicines has created a leadership crisis at our company which a
separation of the Chair and CEO would begin to address.



      We believe an independent Board Chairseparated from the CEOis the preferable form of
corporate governance. The primary purpose of the Board of Directors is to protect shareholders
interests by providing independent oversight of management and the CEO. The Board gives strategic
direction and guidance to our Company.


      The Board will likely accomplish both roles more effectively by separating the roles of Chair
and CEO. An independent Chair will enhance investor confidence in our Company and strengthen the
integrity of the Board of Directors.


      A number of respected institutions recommend such separation. CalPERs Corporate Core
Principles and Guidelines state: the independence of a majority of the Board is not enough and
that the leadership of the board must embrace independence, and it must ultimately change the way
in which directors interact with management.


      An independent board structure will also help the board address complex policy issues facing
our company, foremost among them the crisis in access to pharmaceutical products.


      Millions of Americans and others around the world have no access to our companys life-saving
medicines. This is an emergency, and our companys charitable work, while laudable, is neither a
sufficient nor strategic response. We believe an independent Chair and vigorous Board will bring
greater focus to this ethical imperative, and be better able to forge solutions for shareholders
and patients to address this crisis.


      The current business model of the pharmaceutical sector is undergoing significant challenges.
The industry has generated substantial revenue from American purchasers, who pay higher prices for
medicines than people in other developed countries. Pressure on drug pricing and dependence on this
business model may impact our companys long-term value.


      In order to ensure that our Board can provide the proper strategic direction for our Company
with independence and accountability, we urge a vote FOR this resolution.


Statement in Opposition to the Proposal Regarding Separating the Roles of Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer
The directors and corporate governance committee and the public policy and compliance committee of
the board have reviewed this proposal, and believe that the strategy of combining the roles of
board chair and chief executive officer (CEO) generally provides the most efficient and effective
leadership model for the company and that the boards corporate governance principles ensure the
boards independence. In addition, while there is an urgent need for health care reforms in the
United States, the board does not agree that the means outlined under this proposal will achieve
greater pharmaceutical access or allow us to better address the pressures on our business.



      Lilly has a strong, independent board that operates under sound principles of corporate
governance. See pages 11-14 for a full description of the boards governance principles. The board
is currently composed entirely of independent, nonemployee members with two exceptions, the chief
financial officer and the CEO, who also serves as chair. The boards policy is that there should
always be a substantial majority (75 percent or more) of independent, nonemployee directors. The
independent chair of the compensation committee serves as the presiding director of the board. He
or she recommends to the board the process by which a new chairman and chief execu-


29
 



 

tive officer will be selected, depending upon the circumstances at the time. Additionally, the
independent directors meet in executive session after every regular board meeting, and at least
annually to consider the performance of the company and the CEO. The compensation committee chair
serves as presiding director for these sessions.



      The public policy and compliance committee (the committee), which is responsible for
non-financial compliance and issues of public policy, is composed solely of independent directors,
who provide appropriate independent oversight of public policy issues for the board. The committee
considers compliance matters and political, social and legal trends and issues that may have an
impact on the business or reputation of the company. The committee also oversees corporate policies
and practices that relate to public policy and compliance. For example, in the past two years the
committee has considered, among other things, pharmaceutical pricing and access to medicines, the
United States Medicare Modernization Act, importation, and intellectual property.


      With regard to the concerns about pharmaceutical access that prompted this shareholder
proposal, we agree that significant changes are needed in the United States health care system. We
recognize and embrace the need for sustainable reforms that will improve patient access to health
care and cut waste and inefficiency out of the system, while preserving the free-market,
competitive environment that produces innovative new health care solutions for patients. Until such
a comprehensive solution is reached, we are working to address the immediate needs of those without
access to health care while maintaining our ability to discover and develop new medicines.


      Our most recently introduced access program is LillyAnswers, a program designed to provide
needy seniors with access to the companys medicines. Patients enrolled in LillyAnswers pay only a
$12 administrative fee for a 30-day supply of any Lilly prescription medication at participating
pharmacies. Medicare-eligible individuals who do not have public or private coverage for
prescription medicine, and who have an income below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, are
eligible for LillyAnswers. This program is also available to patients through the new Medicare
discount card program. From its inception to December 31, 2004, LillyAnswers has enrolled more than
330,000 members and filled approximately 1,525,000 prescriptions.


      In addition, under our long-standing Lilly Cares program, we offer free medication, through
physicians, to patients who are otherwise unable to obtain their Lilly medicine. In 2004, we
responded to more than 280,000 Lilly Cares requests, providing more than $166 million in free
products to people in need.


      We also assist patients in obtaining reimbursement and product supplies through programs
designed specifically for several products, including:





 
  
Gemzar® (cancer)


 


 
  
Humatrope® (human growth hormone)


 


 
  
Forteo® (severe osteoporosis)


 


 
  
Xigris® (severe sepsis)


 


 
  
Alimta® (malignant pleural mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer)


      On the international front, in 1999, the company initiated a program to improve access to
tuberculosis care worldwide, and in June 2003 we announced the Lilly MDR-TB Partnership. Working
with the World Health Organization (WHO) and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), we now distribute a
significant amount of our production of capreomycin and cycloserine for multi-drug resistant
tuberculosis (MDR-TB) via the WHO at a fraction of production cost. As part of this program, we are
transferringfree of chargethe technology to manufacture these drugs in nations where the disease
is most prevalent. We are partnering with the WHO, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Center for Disease Control, Brigham and Womens Hospital, and Purdue University to increase both
the number of trained personnel and the supply of drugs available to treat MDR-TB.


      Finally, we have a number of other philanthropic efforts under way to increase access to
medicines, including financial support to organizations involved in:





 
  
patient advocacy


 


 
  
disease and treatment research


 


 
  
relevant education


 


 
  
improving access to medical care


 


 
  
programs that assist patients in getting appropriate treatment and living with their diseases.


      We believe our ultimate responsibility is to continue to provide innovative products that
address patients needs and to provide payers with demonstrable value. We are working hard to find
ways to do this more efficiently and at lower cost.


      In summary, we share the proponents goal of improved access to health care but not their
approach. The company will continue to be a strong advocate for reforms that improve access to
needed medicines while maintaining a free-market health care system and protecting our ability to
deliver breakthrough medicines.

Item 4. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Importation of Drugs
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
Re-Importation of Drugs
Resolved, That the shareholders of Eli Lilly Inc. (Lilly) request that the Board of
Directors (1) adopt a policy that does not constrain the reimportation of prescription drugs into
the U.S. by limiting the supply of drugs in foreign markets, and (2) prepare a report to
shareholders on that policy, at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, by September
2005.


Statement of Support: Increasingly U.S. citizens, especially seniors, are purchasing prescription
drugs abroad because such drugs are substantially cheaper. The Congressional Budget Office has
confirmed that brand name drugs cost, on average, 33 to 55 percent less in other industrialized
countries than in the U.S. A Civil Society Institute survey indicates that as many as 18 percent of
citizens are splitting or skipping pills to cut drug costs, placing them at health risk. The
escalating cost of prescription drugs has been the subject of intense media attention, and spurred
the enactment of a Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2003.



      The importation of prescription drugs is a growing business. Canada has been a principal
source for such exports to the U.S. These exports have grown from $50 million in 1998 to nearly $1
billion in 2004. State and local governments, which provide health benefits to state employees,
retirees, and others, are encouraging reimportation. Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Dakota,
Wisconsin and Illinois have established web sites to connect state residents with Canadian
pharmacies the states have deemed safe. Vermont is suing the Food and Drug Administration for
wrongfully denying permission to set up a reimportation program.


      Lilly announced in October 2003 that it would limit the supply of its prescription drug
products to 24 drug wholesalers in Canada. In its letter to wholesalers, Lilly stated that it would
limit sales of its drugs to amounts that Lilly estimates are sufficient to supply the Canadian
market only, and that its contracts with wholesalers in Canada do not allow exports. In March 2004,
Lilly identified retail pharmacies that could purchase Lilly products through wholesalers only
after submitting purchase orders to Lilly Canada corporate headquarters for review and approval of
their purchase order quantities.


      We believe that depriving U.S. citizens of affordable access to Lillys products may be
harmful to Lillys brand name and reputation, and puts Lilly in conflict with programs supported by
its customers. By actively limiting sales and creating artificial shortages of our products, many
of which are category leaders or the only drug available for a particular condition, Lilly is
forsaking long-term market development and reputation for near-term higher profits.


      We are also concerned that the strategy entails regulatory risk. In U.S. federal district
court in Minnesota, class action certification is being sought in suits brought by the Minnesota
Seniors Organization and United Senior Action of Indiana alleging violations of U.S. antitrust
laws.


Statement in Opposition to the Proposal Regarding Importation of Drugs
The public policy and compliance committee of the board has reviewed the shareholder proposal
and finds that it is not in the best of interest of shareholders as it asks us to develop and
promulgate a policy that is in direct conflict with existing laws of the United States and our
objective of ensuring safe supply of our drugs around the world. In addition, such a policy would
harm our ability to discover and develop innovative drugs.



      Importation of pharmaceuticals into the United States is illegal, and the safety of illegally
imported products cannot be ensured. Efforts to open the Canadian system to supply the much larger
United States market would open United States consumers to threats of counterfeit products, product
tampering, and product integrity problems with their medicines. The Canadian government has stated
that it will not establish regulatory processes to address the safety and integrity of
pharmaceuticals passing through Canada destined for other countries. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has repeatedly stated that it cannot guarantee the safety of medicine coming into
the United States from outside the current regulatory framework. In fact, at the end of last year,
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Task Force on Drug Importation (HHS task force)
reported on its year-long examination of the risks and benefits of importation. The HHS task force,
composed of leaders from across federal government, gathered information from around the world,
heard testimony from stakeholders of all kinds, and concluded that allowing importation from other
countries would open a channel for potentially dangerous counterfeit drugs.


      Maintaining product integrity is essential to patient safety. The companys decision to supply
Canadian wholesalers only sufficient product to meet local Canadian demand is consistent with
historical company contract requirements and with our evaluation of the safety of the Canadian
system. If the company does not take steps to protect the United States and Canadian supply chains
from counterfeiting and tampering, patients could be placed at risk and we could face legal and financial threats and harm to our reputation.


31
 



 

      In addition, the Canadian government places price controls on medicines. Importing
artificially low pharmaceutical prices from Canada introduces price controls into the United
States free market system. Price controls around the world discourage investment in research and
development, limiting innovation. The HHS task force found that legalized importation would likely
adversely effect incentives for research and development, thereby slowing the flow of new drugs.
This conclusion is supported by a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC), which
estimated that price controls in developed countries cost U.S drug companies lost sales sufficient
to fund research and development that could produce up to three to four new drugs per year.


      The company understands that some individuals struggle to pay for our medicines. The HHS task
force also found that total savings to consumers from legalized importation would be a small
percentage relative to total drug spending in the U.S. (about 1 to 2 percent). In the interest of
patients, we supported the addition of a pharmaceutical benefit program to Medicare. In addition,
we have taken steps to ensure access to our medicines through our LillyAnswers and Lilly Cares
programs. We fully support new approaches to providing greater access to pharmaceuticals while
protecting the incentives to invest in the safe and effective cures of tomorrow. Providing greater
access at the expense of patient safety and product integrity is not the right solution. More
information on both our patient assistance programs and industry websites and call centers can be
found at www.lilly.com/products/access/.


Item 5. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Limiting Product Supply
to Canada
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
Limiting Product Supply to Canada
Whereas, current business practices of the company have resulted in a pricing structure that
charges United States customers significantly higher prices for the same prescription medicines
made available at significantly lower prices in Canada, other developed countries and world
markets; and



      Whereas, governmental agencies and individuals in the United States are demanding
affordable drug prices and are taking actions to access lower priced products from Canada and
other world markets; and


      Whereas, according to published reports, the company has cut supplies of its medicines to
Canadian wholesalers and companies that it claims allowed its product to be sold to Americans
seeking lower prices available in the Canadian market; and


      Whereas, according to published reports, the companys actions have resulted in lawsuits
and threatened lawsuits; and


      Whereas, the companys actions to limit supply of medicines in Canada may violate local,
national and international laws and could result in large settlements, large awards of damages and
potential punitive damages which would negatively impact the economic stability of the company and
the value of its shares.


      Resolved, Shareholders request the Board of Directors to prepare a report on the effects on
the long-term economic stability of the company and on the risks of liability to legal claims that
arise from the companys policy of limiting the availability of the companys products to Canadian
wholesalers or pharmacies that allow purchase of its products by U.S. residents. The report should
be prepared at reasonable cost and omitting proprietary information, by September 30, 2005.


Statement of support: We urge shareholders to vote FOR this proposal.



Statement in Opposition to the Proposal Regarding Limiting Product Supply to Canada
The public policy and compliance committee of the board has reviewed this proposal and
believes that creating such a report is an unnecessary, resource-intensive exercise that detracts
from the companys ability to meet its current business prioritiesincluding addressing the issue
of uninsured and under-insured Americans in a safer, more meaningful way.



      We disclose material financial and legal risks to the company in Forms 10-Q, 10-K, and 8-K
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and public policy issues such as access
to medicines in our annual Corporate Responsibility Report (available
on our website at
responsible.lilly.com). We believe the business risks from our supply chain management practices
are immaterial, do not warrant further discussion in our SEC filings, and do not rise to the level
of a special report. We have acted independently to develop supply chain management systems,
policies, and associated customer contracts. We do not believe we will assume regulatory risk by
employing our current global strategy linking supply of our products to Canadian wholesalers to
Canadian patient demand. Moreover, while we have disclosed in our SEC filings that we (along with
several other pharmaceutical


32
 



 

companies) have been named in lawsuits alleging that our conduct in preventing commercial
importation of prescription drugs violates antitrust laws, we believe the suits are without
merit and will not have a material impact on our operations.



      The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act makes it illegal to import unapproved, misbranded,
and adulterated drugs into the United States, which includes foreign versions of U.S.-approved
medications. We adhere to these laws. Importation of pharmaceutical products puts patients at
greater risk of buying and receiving product that is outdated or otherwise compromised, or
counterfeit copies of our products that contain inert or overly potent ingredients.


      We have taken steps to ensure access to our medicines through our LillyAnswers and Lilly Cares
programs. We fully support new approaches to providing greater access to pharmaceuticals while
protecting the incentives to invest in the safe and effective cures of tomorrow. Importing
medicines at the expense of patient safety and product integrity is not the right solution.


Item 6. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Reports on the Companys Political
Contributions
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
Resolved, that the shareholders of Eli Lilly (Company) hereby request that the Company provide a
report updated semi-annually, disclosing the Companys:






(1)  
Policies and procedures for political contributions (both direct and indirect) made with
corporate funds.


 


(2)  
Monetary and non-monetary contributions to political candidates, political parties, political
committees and
other political entities organized and operating under 26 USC Sec. 527 of the Internal Revenue
Code including the following:





 
a.  
An accounting of the Companys funds contributed to any of the persons described above;


 


 
b.  
The business rationale for each of the Companys political contributions; and


 


 
c.  
Identification of the person or persons in the Company who participated in
making the decisions to
contribute.


This report shall be posted on the companys website to reduce costs to shareholders.


Statement of Support: As long-term shareholders of Eli Lilly, we support policies that apply
transparency and accountability to corporate political giving. In our view, such disclosure is
consistent with public policy in regard to public company disclosure.



      There are various disclosure requirements for political contributions but they are difficult
for shareholders to access and are not complete. Although the Bi-Partisan Campaign Reform Act
enacted in 2002 prohibits corporate contributions to political parties at the federal level,
corporate soft money state-level contributions are legal in 49 states and disclosure standards
vary widely.


      Corporations can also make unlimited contributions to Section 527 organizations, political
committees formed for the purpose of influencing elections but not supporting or opposing specific
candidates. These do not have to be reported.


      Between January 1, 1991 and December 31, 2002 the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers
Association (PhRMA)of which the company is a dues-paying membergave $35.5 million in soft money
political contributions. (Follow the Dollar Report, July 1, 2003, Common Cause).


      Company executives exercise wide discretion over the use of corporate resources for political
purposes. They make decisions without a stated business rationale for such donations. In 2001-02,
the last fully reported election cycle, Eli Lilly contributed at least $853,024 (The Center for
Responsive Politics, Soft Money Donors, http://www.opensecrets.org/softmoney).


      Relying only on the limited data available from Federal Election Commission and the Internal
Revenue Service, the Center for Responsive Politics, a leading campaign finance watchdog
organization, provides an incomplete picture of the Companys political donations.


      Proponents believe our company should be using its resources to win in the marketplace through
superior products and services to its customers, not because it has superior access to political
leaders. Political power can change, leaving companies relying on this strategy vulnerable.


      Finally, the requested report represents a minimal cost to the company, as presumably
management already monitors corporate resources used for such purposes. Although lacking a business
rationale for such contributions, our peer company Pfizer discloses these contributions on an
annual basis.


      There is currently no single source of information that provides the information sought by this
resolution. That is why we urge your support for this critical governance reform.


33
 



 

Statement in Opposition to the Proposal Regarding Reports on the Companys Political
Contributions
The public policy and compliance committee of the board has reviewed this proposal and
recommends a vote against it as we have agreed to publish most of the information requested by the
shareholder. The additional reporting requirements would place an undue administrative burden on
the company and, for some elements, would violate our employee privacy policy.



      Beginning in the first quarter of 2005, we will publish the following information for both
company and employee political action committee (PAC) contributions in the United States on
our website (www.lilly.com):





 
   
candidate names and party affiliation listed by state


 


 
   
candidate districts


 


 
   
PAC donations to each candidates campaign


 


 
   
company donations to each candidates campaign


 


 
   
company and PAC donations to state political organizations and Section 527 organizations.


      This information will be updated annually.


      We are committed to participation in the political process as a responsible corporate citizen
to help inform the debate in the United States over health care and pharmaceutical innovation. As a
company that operates in a highly competitive and regulated industry, we must participate in the
political process in order to fulfill our fiduciary responsibility to our shareholders.


      The company sponsors an employee PAC, funded by voluntary contributions from eligible
employees. In addition to the information available on our website, detailed federal PAC
contribution data are available to the public on the Federal Election Committee (FEC) website and
through the individual states agencies. The company does not contribute corporate funds to any
federal political candidate or national political party.


      The employee PAC board of directors, representing a cross-section of PAC-eligible employees,
oversees the donations made by the PAC and the company. After establishing a budget for PAC and
company contributions within each state and a budget for federal PAC contributions, the following
factors are considered when evaluating candidates to support: dedication to improving the
relationship between business and government; demonstrated potential for legislative leadership;
degree of company involvement in the relevant community (e.g., presence of a Lilly facility or
concentration of employees or retirees); historic voting record or announced positions on issues of
importance to the company; and demonstrated leadership on key committees of key importance to our
business. Members of the companys government affairs group bring forward specific recommendations
for PAC and company contributions in the United States; additional approvals by the chief financial
officer and general counsel of the company are required for company contributions.


Item 7. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Performance-Based Stock Options
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST this proposal.
Performance-Based Stock Options
Resolved, The shareholders of Eli Lilly & Co. (Lilly) urge the Board of Directors to adopt a
policy that a significant portion of future stock option grants to senior executives shall be
performance-based. Performance-based stock options are defined as:






 
(1)  
indexed options, whose exercise price is linked to an industry index;


 


 
(2)  
premium-priced stock options, whose exercise price is above the market price on the grant
date; or


 


 
(3)  
performance-vesting options, which vest when the market price of the stock exceeds a
specific target.


Statement of Support: As shareholders, we support compensation policies for senior executives that
provide challenging performance objectives and motivate executives to achieve long-term shareholder
value. We are concerned, however, that Lilly is not tying the award of stock options closely enough
to the Companys performance.



      At present, Lilly awards stock options at the market price on the
date they are granted. In our view, standard stock options can give windfalls to executives who are
lucky enough to hold them during a bull market and penalize executives who hold them during a bear
market. Investors and market observers, including Warren Buffett, Alan Greenspan and Al Rappaport,
criticize standard options as inappropriately rewarding mediocre or poor performance. Mr. Buffett
has characterized standard stock option plans as really a royalty on the passage of time, and all
three favor using indexed options.


34
 



 

      Performance-based options tie compensation more closely to company performance.
Premium-priced and performance-vesting options encourage senior executives to set and meet
ambitious but realistic performance targets. Indexed options may have the added benefit of
discouraging repricing in the event of an industry downturn.


      We believe that adopting performance-based options is the logical next step for Lilly to
better align its compensation practices with long term shareholder interests.


      The need for clearer standards is, we believe, illustrated by the compensation award to the
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). In 2003, the CEO received a raise in each of these
categories: salary, bonus, and long-term compensation. The 350,000 stock options that he received
in 2003 (identical to the number awarded in 2002) were not based upon objective performance
measures with relative weights assigned, but were based upon internal relativity, peer group data,
and the size of grants previously made. His total 2003 compensation exceeded the median for CEOs
in Lillys peer group and came to an estimated $9.9 million when the value of 350,000 stock options
granted is added to salary, bonus and all other compensation totaling over $2.8 million.


      We believe that equity compensation for senior executives should be more closely tied to
Lillys performance. Lilly stock has consistently underperformed the S&P 500 index for the one-,
three- and five-year periods ending November 10, 2004. In addition, average earnings have trailed
Lillys peers in recent years, as the company has experienced the early loss of patent protection
for Prozac, as well as a hiring freeze and layoffs.


Statement in Opposition to the Performance Based Stock Option Proposal
      The compensation committee of the board of directors has reviewed this proposal and believes
that, on balance, it is not in the best interests of shareholders.


      The shareholder states that executive compensation policies should provide challenging
performance objectives and motivate executives to achieve long-term shareholder value. We agree.
For many years our executive compensation policy has been grounded on the principle that
compensation should foster the long-term focus necessary for success in the pharmaceutical
industry. We do not agree, however, that the best way to achieve that objective is to adopt the
mandate suggested by the shareholder. Although in some circumstances the types of stock options
recommended by the shareholder may be useful, we believe that the compensation committee needs
flexibility to grant other forms of options, including the currently used market-price options, as
circumstances require.


      For Lilly executives, cash and equity compensation are tied closely to both individual and
company performance. The compensation committee takes into account individual performance in
establishing base salaries as well as the size of bonus and equity targets. As to company
performance, a significant proportion of total cash compensation is awarded under the companys
bonus plan, which is based on growth in sales and earnings per share. In establishing the
performance targets under the plan, we consider the expected performance of Lilly and the other
companies in our peer group. With respect to equity compensation, we use a mix of stock options and
performance awards, which are stock grants that are payable only if the company achieves certain
earnings-per-share growth targets. As with the cash bonuses, we set the targets for performance
awards with reference to our projections of peer group performance. Finally, as we move into 2005
and beyond, we are reducing the size of stock option grants at all levels of management in favor of
a greater emphasis on performance awards.


      The past three years demonstrate that pay for performance is very much a part of both cash and
equity compensation at Lilly. The company has faced a number of difficult internal and external
challenges in that time, and executive compensation reflects those challenges:





 
  
There were no cash bonuses paid for 2002.


 


 
  
Cash bonuses for 2003 and 2004 were below target.


 


 
  
There were no performance awards earned with respect to 2002 or 2003.


Additionally, as of early February 2005, virtually all stock options granted since 1997 are under
waterthat is, the exercise price is higher than the current market price of the stock. We do not
reprice options.



      Regarding Mr. Taurels 2003 compensation, we note that while he did receive an increase in
base salary, Mr. Taurelat his own requestworked for a $1 base salary in 2002. Further, his 2003
salary was only a 4 percent increase over his 2001 salary. His increase in cash bonus in 2003 was a
result of there being no bonus payout in 2002. Finally, with respect to his long-term compensation
in 2003, he did not receive a performance award payout, and his stock option grant was the same
number of shares as the previous year.


      The compensation committee, aided by its independent compensation consultant, will continue to
review compensation trends and consider new ideas, including performance-based options. However, to
ensure that the company attracts and retains talented leadership and motivates its leaders to
deliver long-term growth in shareholder value, the compensation committee must have flexibility to
design programs as it deems most appropriate, without being restricted by mandates such as the one
proposed by the shareholder.

Item 8. Shareholder Proposal Regarding Animal
Testing
The board recommends that you vote AGAINST
this proposal.
Animal Testing
Whereas, statistics published by research oversight bodies in North America and Europe document
that the vast majority of painful and distressing animal experiments are conducted to satisfy
outdated, government-mandated testing requirements2 and that such testing is on the
rise;3 and



      Whereas, nearly 60% of animals used in regulatory testing suffer pain ranging from moderate to
severe, all the way to pain near, at, or above the pain tolerance threshold,4 generally
without any pain relief; and


      Whereas, non-animal test methods are generally less expensive,5 more rapid, and
always more humane, than animal-based tests; and


      Whereas, unlike animal tests, non-animal methods have been scientifically validated and/or
accepted as total replacements for the following five toxicity endpoints: skin corrosion
(irreversible tissue damage), skin irritation (milder and reversible damage), skin absorption (the
rate of chemical penetration), phototoxicity (an inflammatory reaction caused by the interaction of
a chemical with sunlight), and pyrogenicity (a fever-like reaction that can occur when certain
intravenous drugs interact with the immune system);


      Now Therefore Be It Resolved, that the shareholders request that the Board:





 
(1)  
Commit specifically to using only non-animal methods for assessing skin corrosion,
irritation, absorption, phototoxicity, and pyrogenicity.


 


 
(2)  
Confirm that it is in the Companys best interest to commit to replacing animal-based
tests with non-animal methods.


 


 
(3)  
Petition the relevant regulatory agencies requiring safety testing for the Companys
products to accept
as total replacements for animal-based methods, those approved non-animal methods described
above,
along with any others currently used and accepted by the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) and other developed countries.


Statement of Support: This Resolution is designed to harmonize the interests of sound science with
the elimination of animal-based test methods where non-animal methodologies exist. It seeks to
encourage the relevant regulatory agencies to join their peers in accepting validated in vitro and
other non-animal test methods. It will not compromise consumer safety or violate applicable
statutes and regulations.



      Further, this Resolution commits the Company to end animal testing for five specific endpoints
in favor of valid non-animal methods. These include the 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test,
human skin equivalent tests for corrosivity, and a human blood-based test for pyrogenicity, all of
which have been successfully validated through the European Centre for the Validation of
Alternative Methods.6 Several non-animal methods have also been adopted as Test
Guidelines by the OECD7 (an alliance of 30 member countries including the US, EU, Japan,
Canada and Australia). Regulatory agencies in OECD member countries are not at liberty to reject
data from non-animal tests for skin corrosion, skin absorption and phototoxicity where such data
have been generated in accordance with an OECD Test Guideline.


Statement in Opposition to the Animal Testing Proposal
The public policy and compliance committee of the board has reviewed this proposal and
recommends that you vote against it. We are committed to the responsible treatment of all
laboratory animals and work to eliminate or reduce their use in our pharmaceutical research. Where
animals must be used, we take every measure to assure that the fewest number of animals are used
and that discomfort and distress are either eliminated or minimized. All animals at the company are
cared for under the close supervision of experienced veterinarians and trained ani-

mal caretakers. Our animal care and use policies and guidelines are published in our Corporate
Citizenship Report on our website (www.lilly.com). We have been accredited by the Association for
the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International for more than 30 years.



      Specifically, we are committed to using non-animal methods for assessing skin corrosion,
irritation, absorption, phototoxicity and pyrogenicity where appropriate. This type of testing is
already a rare occurrence at the company, due to the focus of our research and development
programs. We replace animal testing with analysis by computer models or other non-animal adjunct
methods whenever appropriate. We use animals only in pre-clinical research to confirm safety and
efficacy of medicines when there are no alternatives that adequately model the human body. We
continually evaluate testing methods that involve fewer animals, or no animals at all.


      However, we are currently required by regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) to conduct confirmatory testing on animals
for verification of product safety prior to administering investigational drugs and biologics to
human beings. In many cases, the use of non-animal methods can replace animal testing; however,
while there are cases where a non-animal screen can indicate the probability that a compound is
safe, an animal test is scientifically necessary to confirm this finding. Because our top priority
must always be the safety of research volunteers and patients, we cannot in good conscience
petition the regulatory agencies that currently require safety testing on animals to accept only
non-animal testing methods until those testing methods are deemed by a consensus of the research
community and the regulators to be of equal accuracy, quality and reliability to testing in a
complex living organism.


Other Matters



Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance
Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, our directors and executive officers are
required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission reports of holdings and changes in
beneficial ownership of company stock. We have reviewed copies of reports provided to the company,
as well as other records and information. Based on that review, we concluded that all reports were
timely filed except: Mr. Gerhard Mayr (now retired) was late in reporting a stock option grant; Dr.
Steven Paul was late in reporting shares of stock withheld to pay taxes due upon vesting of a
restricted stock grant; and Mr. Sidney Taurel was late in reporting a gift of shares to his wife.
Upon discovery, these matters were promptly addressed.



Other Information Regarding the Companys Proxy Solicitation
We will pay all expenses in connection with our solicitation of proxies. We will pay brokers,
nominees, fiduciaries, or other custodians their reasonable expenses for sending proxy material to
and obtaining instructions from persons for whom they hold stock of the company. We expect to
solicit proxies primarily by mail, but directors, officers, and other employees of the company may
also solicit in person or by telephone, telefax, or electronic mail. We have retained Georgeson
Shareholder Communications Inc. to assist in the distribution and solicitation of proxies.
Georgeson may solicit proxies by personal interview, telephone, telefax, mail, and electronic mail.
We expect that the fee for those services will not exceed $17,000 plus reimbursement of customary
out-of-pocket expenses.

Appendix A



Audit Committee Charter
Purpose
The audit committees primary function is to assist the board of directors in fulfilling its
oversight responsibilities by monitoring:






 
  
The integrity of financial information which will be provided to the shareholders and others;


 


 
  
The systems of internal controls and disclosure controls which management has established;


 


 
  
The performance of internal and external audit functions; and


 


 
  
The companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.


Composition
The committee shall consist of no fewer than three directors. All committee members must meet
applicable New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) independence
and experience requirements. All committee members shall be financially literate or must become
financially literate within a reasonable period of time after appointment to the committee. At
least one member of the committee shall be an audit committee financial expert as determined by the
board in accordance with NYSE listing standards. At least one member of the committee shall serve
concurrently on the public policy and compliance committee.



      The committee members shall be appointed for one-year terms at the annual meeting of the
board. The board shall designate the chairperson.


Administrative Matters
The committee shall meet not
less than six times per year and shall report at the next board meeting
following each such committee meeting. The committee shall meet at least annually with the public
policy and compliance committee. This meeting will allow the audit committee to review
non-financial legal and regulatory compliance as well as the risk assessment and risk management
processes, which are overseen by the public policy and compliance committee. The committee shall
meet periodically with management, the internal auditors, and the independent auditor in separate
executive sessions. The committee may request an officer or employee of the company, the companys
outside counsel, or representatives of the companys independent auditor to attend a meeting of the
committee or to meet with any members of, or advisors to, the committee. The committee may, at any
time, retain its own outside advisors at the companys expense.

General Auditor
Office of the Corporate Secretary
Chief Accounting Officer


Duties and Responsibilities
To fulfill its duties and responsibilities, the committee shall:


1. Annually review and reassess this charter.


2. Maintain a clear understanding with management and the independent auditors that the
committee is directly
responsible for compensation and oversight of the work of the independent auditor, including:






 
  
Having the sole authority (subject to shareholder ratification) to appoint or replace the independent auditor;


 


 
  
Approving the compensation of the independent auditor;


 


 
  
Reviewing and evaluating the lead partner of the independent audit team;


 


 
  
Reviewing the audit scope and audit plan of the independent auditor;


 


 
  
Obtaining and reviewing, at least annually, a report from the independent auditor which describes the firms
internal compliance procedures, any issues raised from peer reviews, or other quality reviews of the firm, any
steps taken to deal with the issues, and all relationships between the firm and Lilly;


 


 
  
Ensuring rotation of the lead audit partner as required by law (or any stricter policies as may be established by
the committee);


 


 
  
Setting clear hiring policies for employees or former employees of the independent auditor; and


 


 
  
Resolving disagreements between management and the independent auditor regarding financial reporting.


38
 



 

3. Pre-approve all audit services and approve permitted non-audit services (including fees and
terms) to be performed for Lilly by the independent auditor, consistent with the requirements of the SEC and NYSE
or any stricter
standards as may be adopted by the committee.


4. Oversee the internal audit function, including:






 
  
Reviewing the appointment and replacement of the general auditor;


 


 
  
Reviewing and approving the internal audit plan;


 


 
  
Reviewing significant reports to management prepared by internal audit (and managements response); and


 


 
  
Discussing with the independent auditor and management the responsibilities, budget,
and staffing of the
internal audit function.


      The general auditor will report directly to the chair of the audit committee, with a secondary
reporting relationship to the chief financial officer for administrative purposes.

5. Prepare a report for inclusion in the companys annual proxy statement in accordance with SEC
regulations.


6. Review, with management and the independent auditors, the annual and quarterly financial results
before they
are filed in periodic reports with the SEC or other regulators. These reviews shall include
discussions with management and the independent auditor regarding significant financial reporting issues and judgments
made in
connection with the preparation of Lillys financial statements and any special steps adopted in
light of material
control deficiencies. The committee shall also receive regular reports from the independent auditor
on the critical accounting policies and practices of Lilly and significant alternative treatments of financial
information within
GAAP that have been discussed with management. The committee shall discuss with the independent
auditor the
auditors assessment of the quality, not just the acceptability, of the companys accounting
principles as required
by SAS No. 61.


7. Review and discuss with management Lillys earnings press releases, including the use of pro
forma non-GAAP information, as well as financial information and earnings guidance provided to analysts and
rating agencies.


8. Provide an open avenue of communication between the independent auditor, the general auditor,
and the board,
including sufficient opportunity for the independent auditor and the general auditor to meet with
the committee
without members of management present.


9. Consider and review with the independent auditor, the chief accounting officer, and the general
auditor:






 
  
The independent auditors audit of financial statements and their report thereof;


 


 
  
The adequacy of the companys internal controls and disclosure controls;


 


 
  
Any related significant findings and recommendations of the independent auditors or
the internal auditors
together with managements responses thereto;


 


 
  
Any difficulties encountered in the course of the audits, including any restriction on
the scope of work or access
to required information; and


 


 
  
Any material written communications between the independent auditor and management, including
management letters or schedules of unadjusted differences.


10. Oversee the companys dissemination of and compliance with the companys code of conduct,
including but not limited to those codes that apply specifically to employees involved in matters that affect
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting.


11. Review procedures to promote and protect employee reporting of suspected fraud or wrongdoing
relating to accounting, auditing, or financial reporting, including procedures for:






 
  
Receiving, retaining, and addressing complaints received by Lilly relating to such matters;


 


 
  
Enabling employees to submit to the committee, on a confidential and anonymous basis, any
concerns regarding
such matters; and


 


 
  
Protecting reporting employees from retaliation.


12. Together with the public policy and compliance committee, assist the board in its oversight of
legal and regulatory compliance. The audit committee shall have sole oversight over matters of financial compliance
(accounting,



39
 



 

auditing, financial reporting, and investor disclosures). As to all other areas of compliance
(non-financial compliance), the public policy and compliance committee shall have oversight
responsibilities in the first instance; however, the two committees shall meet jointly at least
annually to review the major non-financial compliance matters, including:






 
  
Overall state of compliance


 


 
  
Significant legal or regulatory compliance exposure


 


 
  
Material reports or inquiries from regulators.


13. Together with the public policy and compliance committee, review at least annually a summary of
the risk assessment and risk management processes and policies.


14. Inquire of management, the general auditor, and the independent auditors about significant
financial risks or
exposures and evaluate the steps management has taken to assess and minimize such risks to the
company, including review of managements financial risk management policies.


15. Review policies and procedures with respect to senior managements expense accounts, including
their use of
corporate assets, and consider the results of any review of these areas by the general auditor or
the independent
auditor.


16. Conduct or authorize investigations into any matters within the committees scope of
responsibilities. The committee may retain (at the companys expense) independent counsel, accountants, or others to assist
in the conduct of any investigation.


17. The committee shall also undertake such additional activities within the scope of its primary
functions as the committee may from time to time determine.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
