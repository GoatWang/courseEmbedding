Energy Saving Tip

Want to make a strong statement about energy efficiency? Consider whether your home might be a good candidate for a green roof, solar panels, or a geothermal system.

Interview with Chris Policinski, President and CEO of Land O’Lakes, Inc.

As the Chairman of the USGLC’s Business Advisory Council, how do you explain to your fellow CEOs the importance of the International Affairs Budget and funding for development and diplomacy?
The world is getting to be a smaller place every day, and from an economic perspective, what happens in one country has ripple effects throughout the world.  Funding from the International Affairs Budget, which is just 1 percent of the federal budget, helps to strengthen the economies of developing nations around the world.  Whether it’s supporting farmers to grow crops, helping to build better roads so goods can be driven to markets, or teaching children in order to build a more educated workforce, all of these things add to the economic well-being of a country, which, in turn, means new markets are available for American goods.
On the agricultural front, Land O’Lakes is a Fortune 250 company that does much more than produce cheese and butter.  We’re one of the largest crop input and animal nutrition companies in the country, so the opportunity to market our products and services overseas has tremendous revenue potential for Land O’Lakes.

What first interested you in being involved with the USGLC? 
The USGLC is extremely effective in what they do, and their supporters and members are a “Who’s Who” of America’s business and foreign policy leaders.  Individuals like Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright and many prominent individuals here in Minnesota have all spoken about how important the USGLC’s message of smart power engagement is to our country.
Businesses like Caterpillar, Lockheed Martin and Procter & Gamble, as well as prominent non-profit organizations and faith-based groups like CARE, Save the Children and World Vision, have all come together under the USGLC umbrella with a commitment to ensure the U.S. has a robust International Affairs Budget.  This speaks volumes when we visit Capitol Hill.  When a member of Congress sees the commitment of a major company or a respected charity on the same issue, they take notice.  That’s why the USGLC is so effective, and Land O’Lakes is proud to be a part of it.
What are some of the specific things Land O’Lakes does to make a difference in global development? 
In my view, feeding a hungry world is both an obligation and an opportunity.  For nearly three decades, Land O’Lakes has worked to alleviate the effects of hunger around the world through the efforts of our International Development Division.  We work with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Agency for International Development and other partners in the federal government to implement agriculture development programs around the world.
In fact, since the early 1980s, we’ve implemented more than 160 development projects in 72 countries. We’ve also been involved in global school nutrition programs since 2001 in nine different nations.  Our programs help provide fresh milk, dairy products and other agricultural support projects for people in desperate need of nutrition . . . and an income.
Food security has been in the news a lot lately.  What is your take on some solutions from a U.S. development perspective?
Since Land O’Lakes has worked globally fighting hunger for the past 30 years, we have a unique vantage point on the issue of food security.
I believe one of America’s greatest, yet least acknowledged, success stories is our increase in agricultural productivity over the past century.  And how have we done this?  It’s through better farming techniques and technology, both of which we need to share with the rest of the world through our efforts to alleviate global hunger.
Using advanced technologies for global food production, however, can be a divisive topic for governments.  To protect the ability of producers to use safe, proven technologies, those of us involved in any aspect of agriculture must work to educate the public and policymakers about our industry.
I am glad to see the U.S. government making food security a major issue.  Land O’Lakes is already doing tremendous work in agricultural development around the world, thanks to the U.S. International Affairs Budget, and we look forward to providing advice and assisting in U.S. efforts to further alleviate global hunger.

Many American businesses may wonder what possible benefit the USGLC would have for them.  How would you answer that question? 
The work of the USGLC benefits American business in many ways.
It’s important to understand that U.S. foreign assistance programs help stabilize markets in struggling and emerging economies around the world.  Good governance allows businesses to thrive and create opportunity in the private sector.  Providing clean water for communities improves health outcomes and allows for increased productivity because people are sick less often from water-borne diseases.  Educating young people is key to creating a stable, qualified workforce for industry and commerce.  These are just a few of the ways a robust International Affairs Budget helps American businesses succeed in the global marketplace.
At Land O’Lakes, many programs in our International Development Division are funded through the International Affairs Budget.  Helping farmers around the world is good for our business.  We’re creating new markets for our goods, and this is good for Land O’Lakes and for the U.S. economy as a whole.

A different kind of company
In 1921, 320 dairy farmers met in St. Paul, Minnesota, to form the Minnesota Cooperative Creameries Association. Their idea was simple—join together to effectively market and distribute members’ dairy production across the country.
From there, we quickly set our sights on growth. Just eight years after establishing our butter marketing organization, we expanded into the ag services and feed businesses. Our international journey kicked off 52 years later, as we began relaying the lessons we'd learned to support local agriculture in developing nations around the world. Those efforts have also helped us expand our commercial business beyond the borders of the United States.
Today, our four businesses give us a farm-to-fork view of agriculture. Pair this with our farmer ownership and we're uniquely qualified to fulfill our purpose of feeding human progress around the world, while always delivering on our responsibility to member-owners through our core values. We're united in a common cause, committed to excellence and inspired by our place in the world—but there are no shortcuts. We've never lost sight of the value of a hard day's work.

We help independently owned and operated agricultural retailers compete. We do this by providing these retailers with technical know-how, proprietary tools and research-based solutions to help farmers win in the field—and in the marketplace.

LAND O'LAKES, A HISTORY









1891 
Minnesota Governor John S. Pillsbury lures T.L. Haecker, an expert in the science of butter making, to the University of Minnesota. After touring Minnesota's dairy plants, Haecker begins encouraging the formation of co-op creameries.






1921 
It’s a new era. The Minnesota Cooperative Creameries Association forms, and John Brandt is elected to the board of directors. He’ll go on to become our first president.






1924 
In need of a catchy brand for the co-op’s sweet cream butter, the Minnesota Cooperative Creameries Association hosts a contest with $500 in gold offered as the prize. Ida Foss and George Swift each walk away a winner for submitting the name, you guessed it, Land O'Lakes. And the runners up? Maid O' the West and Tommy Tucker.






1930 
During the Great Depression, butter prices sink to an all-time low. We help shore up the weakening market, buying a whopping 7 million pounds of butter. Within four months, prices edged back up.






1937 
Our first milk-drying plant opens in Luck, Wisconsin. The facility manufactures skim milk powders, casein and buttermilk powder. Due to World War II, all of these products see an increased demand. By peak war years, we had another 21 milk-drying plants operating in the Upper Midwest. 






1951 
Our invention of calf milk replacer revolutionizes the feed business. Farmers no longer have to give skim milk to their dairy calves.






1963 
We enter the cheese market in a big way with our acquisition of the Wisconsin-based Dairy Belt Cheese and Butter Company.






1970 
A merger with Farmers Regional Cooperative (Felco) kicks off the beginning of tremendous growth in ag services. We'd long been focused on producing dairy products, while Felco specialized in agricultural inputs, or farm supplies.






1981 
Our international development journey begins. Since then, Land O'Lakes International Development has led 280 programs and trainings in 80 countries to improve food security, farmers' agricultural productivity, and create vibrant and stable market systems.






1998 
A merger with Dairyman's Cooperative Creamery Association of Tulare, California, bolsters our West Coast operations.






2001 
The Purina brand becomes a part of our story. Purina Mills was founded in 1894 to supply fresh, high-quality, consistent feed. Today, that same philosophy holds true.






2007 
Our seed business joins with Agriliance’s crop protection products to form Winfield Solutions, LLC. The WinField® brand is later introduced in 2012.






2015 
We take the next step in our growth journey—onto South African soil. We close on a 52.5 percent ownership stake in Villa Crop Protection. With Villa, we’re positioned to help sustainably improve the yields of farms of all sizes in South Africa and beyond.






2016 
After our crop inputs and insights business merges with United Suppliers, Inc., the WinField® United brand is launched. The business serves more than 1,300 locally owned and operated agricultural retailers with seed, crop protection products, agricultural services and agronomic insights.
