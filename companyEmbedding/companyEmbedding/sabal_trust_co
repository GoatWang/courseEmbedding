Sabal Trust’s Disaster Recovery Plan – 2015
With the hurricane season rapidly approaching we thought it would be helpful and reassuring to share our Disaster Recovery Plan with you. Sabal Trust Company is a limited charter bank regulated by the State of Florida. All banks in Florida are required to have a Disaster Recovery Plan that is tested regularly and updated annually. It includes contingency plans that are activated if we are unable to open for business in a timely fashion after a hurricane.
The first step of our Disaster Recovery Plan provides for the securing of the office(s) if a hurricane is within the five day strike zone of one of our locations. This includes moving our computer equipment, client files and other records to a secure area.
If evacuation orders are subsequently issued, we would close the effected office and direct clients to the closest Sabal Trust Company branch. The main phone number of the closed office will automatically be transferred to an open location. If the storm affects multiple offices, we are prepared to relocate a team of Sabal employees to Atlanta, Georgia.
Subsequent to the hurricane, an assessment would be made as to whether the Sabal office(s) is accessible and could reopen for business. If we are unable to re-open, we would continue to direct clients to an alternative Sabal Trust location.
If a storm should affect all four offices of Sabal Trust Company, we would open operations from Reliance Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia. We would have full access and capabilities from this location. We would operate from this facility until we were able to reopen an office in either our current location or a temporary location. Reliance Trust Company is the largest independent trust company in the United States and currently provides Sabal with data processing, operations support, asset custody services and disaster recovery assistance.
