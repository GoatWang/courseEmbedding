CHARLESTOWN >> Devault Foods, a portion-controlled meat preparation and packing company, announced Tuesday changes in top executive positions.



Longtime President Tom Fillippo is becoming chairman of the board. He will be replaced as president by Brett Black, the current chief operating officer. Fillippo’s son, Thomas W. Fillippo, has been promoted to executive vice president of the 70-year-old firm that provides products like burgers, meatballs, Philly steaks, sausages, steaks and chops.



“Devault Foods is rapidly growing into an unrivaled company with operational excellence,” said Tom Fillippo, who has been president of the company since 1970. “I have strong confidence in Brett, Thomas and the leadership team to successfully carry the Fillippo family legacy into the distant future.”



The company is committed to continuous improvement in operations, developing new trends, expanding product categories and capturing market share in growing geographic markets, it said in its announcement Tuesday.

Devault Foods noted that change is the new constant in any business today with technology developments, globalization and new competitors disrupting traditional business models.



“No business lasts over the long haul if it can’t reinvent itself to address the evolving preferences and needs of its customers.” Black said. “Devault Foods is in a strong position to succeed and the time is ripe to aggressively pursue the company’s new goals.”

	Devault Foods announces that Brett A. Black has been named the company's chief operating officer, effective immediately. Thomas A. Fillippo, president and chief executive officer, stated Black will assume responsibility for leading the daily operations of Devault, with particular focus on both delivering and executing the company's growth strategy.

	Black is broadly recognized for "changing complacent business principles" in order to establish operational excellence that successfully drives business growth with results that surpass customers' expectations. Most recently, Black served as vice president of the Frozen Food Operations for Giorgio Foods, where as part of the senior management team he led Giorgio to new standards of operational effectiveness.

	"Brett is a decisive and dynamic leader with 25 years of industry experience and the proven ability to disrupt traditional thinking," says Fillippo. "He is the perfect person to guide our company to its next level along a growth trajectory that includes innovative co-branding partnerships, new branded products, and new product category alignment that features a revolutionary program with the capacity to harmonize best in class products with matching pricing credentials."

	Black points out, "This is an exciting time for Devault Foods and I look forward to tackling the growth opportunities before us. Our team is extraordinarily capable and committed to achieving the company's goals." Explaining further he adds, "Branding will play a major role in our growth strategy in both foodservice and retail as, collectively, we drive initiatives to keep us in front of market trends, and create trends others will follow."

	"The addition of Brett Black is a major milestone for our organization," concludes Fillippo. "His operational talents, technical background, and entrepreneurial spirit will be invaluable in taking us to new heights of operational excellence and growth. I have tremendous confidence in Brett's ability to align Devault Foods as a world-class industry-leading company and extend us into the next generation."

	Devault Foods, family owned and operated since 1949, is a national supplier of portion-controlled meat products serving the foodservice and retail marketplaces. Headquartered in Malvern, PA, it has the capacity to manufacture and distribute over 2 million pounds of product weekly from its 114,000 square foot state-of-the-art production facility. Focused on improving customers' menu options and operational efficiencies through innovative growth programs, Devault delivers performance value through strong category brands like Mrs. DiFillippo's meatballs, Steakwich steaks, Tommy's Burgers, and Snapatizers starters.
