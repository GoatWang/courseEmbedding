Comment(s)







 


	From the Oil and Gas Journal today:

	Oklahoma-based Gulfport Energy Corp. signed an agreement to buy 22,000 net acres in the Utica shale in eastern Ohio from Windsor Ohio LLC, an affiliate of Wexford Capital LP, for $220 million.

	That will increase Gulfport's leasehold interests in the Utica shale to 137,000 gross (128,000 net) acres.

	This acquisition excludes Windsor Ohio's interest in 14 existing wells and 16 proposed future wells and certain acreage surrounding these wellss.

	The proposed transaction, which is expected to close by Feb. 28, will increase Gulfport's working interest in the acreage to 93.8%.

	Last year, Gulfport acquired 37,000 net acres in the Utica shale from Windsor Ohio LLC

	.

Has anyone heard of Gulfport Buckeye, LLC.?  I received a letter from them saying Paloma Partners III, LLC has changed it's name to Gulfport Buckeye, LLC. Just wondering if anyone knows anything about them.

Paloma Partners III, LLC has not changed it's name - they just sold most of their Ohio acreage to Gulfport, Hess and AEP Utica. http://www.gasandoilmag.com/gas%20&%20oil/2015/06/17/gulfport-e...    
Now I signed with Paloma and was expecting AEP to have the leases; at the last minute, AEP didn't happen - I ended up with XTO.  That is better for us, anyway.

I'm surrounded by two year old AEP leases, but was bought by Gulfport Buckeye. They said they go by the name Buckeye.

Probably a way for Gulfport to keep track of which tracts they own; I wonder if they added the Hess acerage into that as well?   I just know that Paloma still exists in Texas.  Here you go:   http://www.palomaresources.com/partners/paloma-partners-iii/     Looks like they have a IV (4) now too!   They have a good system;get a lot of leases and either drill or hold until someone bigger comes along.  They were good to work with, so I was pleased.   Gulfport tried too but they would not alter the lease any, per my attorney.   
I hope it goes well for you, Terry!  :)

What surprised me was I'm 67 acres in Steubenville Township, Jefferson Co. and AEP would not give me the $200.00 per Acre to match the Paloma offer. AEP said it was because I was on the Steubenville side of the Township line. But Paloma bought me in the middle of AEP 100acre plus tracks. I guess I'm the monkey in the middle. I'll see in three years when it's time to renew.

About
What makes this site so great? Well, I think it's the fact that, quite frankly, we all have a lot at stake in this thing they call shale. But beyond that, this site is made up of individuals who have worked hard for that little yard we call home. Or, that farm on which blood, sweat and tears have fallen. [ Read More ]
