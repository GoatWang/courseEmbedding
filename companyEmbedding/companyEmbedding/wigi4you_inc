	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 




	The
	statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are "forward-looking statements.
	We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial
	trends affecting the financial condition of our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties
	and assumptions, including, among other things:




	 




	Factors
	that might cause these differences include the following:




	  




	●
	the integration of multiple technologies and programs;




	 




	●
	the ability to successfully complete development and commercialization of sites and our company’s expectations regarding
	market growth;




	 




	●
	changes in existing and potential relationships with collaborative partners;




	 




	●
	the ability to retain certain members of management;




	 




	●
	our expectations regarding general and administrative expenses;




	 




	●
	our expectations regarding cash balances, capital requirements, anticipated revenue and expenses, including infrastructure expenses;




	 




	●
	other factors detailed from time to time in filings with the SEC.




	 




	In
	addition, we use words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “expect,” “future,”
	“intend,” and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.




	 




	We
	undertake no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward -looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
	or future events. In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events and circumstances discussed in this may
	not occur and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	March
	31, 2017






	 






	NOTE
	A – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 





	A
	summary of significant accounting policies of Wigi4you, Inc. (the Company) is presented to assist in understanding the Company’s
	financial statements. The accounting policies presented in these footnotes conform to accounting principles generally accepted
	in the United States of America and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements.
	These financial statements and notes are representations of the Company’s management who are responsible for their integrity
	and objectivity. The Company has not realized revenues from its planned principal business purpose.




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	unaudited financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2017 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
	(SEC) Regulation S-X rule 8-03. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same
	basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
	to present fairly the financial position as of March 31, 2017 and the results of operations and cash flows for the period then
	ended. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to the period
	are unaudited. The results for the nine months ended March 31, 2017, are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
	for any subsequent quarters or for the entire year ending June 30, 2017. The balance sheet at June 30, 2016 has been derived from
	the audited financial statements at that date.




	 





	Organization,
	Nature of Business and Trade Name





	 




	Wigi4you,
	Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4you, Inc. intends to provide a website and
	mobile app to assist event planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking locations and planning events in areas
	around the United States and Canada.




	 




	The
	Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties including failing to secure additional funding to
	operationalize the Company’s website and apps before another company develops similar websites or apps.




	 





	Property
	and Equipment





	 




	Property
	and equipment are carried at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged against operations. Renewals and betterments
	that materially extend the life of the assets are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
	related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in income for the
	period.




	 




	Depreciation
	is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated
	useful lives of depreciable assets are:




	 







	 


	 


	Estimated




	 


	 


	Useful Lives




	Office Equipment


	 


	5-10 years




	Copier


	 


	5-7   years




	Vehicles


	 


	5-10 years






	 




	For
	federal income tax purposes, depreciation is computed under the modified accelerated cost recovery system. For financial statements
	purposes, depreciation is computed under the straight-line method.




	 




	The
	Company has been in the developmental stage since inception and has no operations to date. The Company currently does not have
	any property and equipment. The above accounting policies will be adopted upon the Company maintains property and equipment.




	 







	F-

	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	For
	purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all short-term debt securities purchased with maturity of three
	months or less to be cash equivalents.







	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	On
	June 10, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued update ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities
	(Topic 915).   Amongst other things, the amendments in this update removed the definition of development stage
	entity from Topic 915, thereby removing the distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from US
	GAAP.  In addition, the amendments eliminate the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
	information on the statements of income, cash flows and shareholders equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a
	development stage entity;  (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged
	and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
	in the development stage.  The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2014 and
	interim reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2015, however entities are permitted to early adopt for any annual or interim
	reporting period for which the financial statements have yet to be issued.




	 





	Revenue
	recognition





	 




	The
	Company’s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with FASB ASC 605-35 “Revenue Recognition”.  Revenue
	is recognized when a formal arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, all obligations have been performed pursuant
	to the terms of the formal arrangement and collectability is reasonably assured.  The Company recognizes revenues on sales
	of its services, based on the terms of the customer agreement.  The customer agreement takes the form of either a contract
	or a customer purchase order and each provides information with respect to the service being sold and the sales price.  If
	the customer agreement does not have specific delivery or customer acceptance terms, revenue is recognized at the time the service
	is provided to the customer.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments




	 




	The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that
	are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as
	the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
	participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required
	to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact
	and the market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such
	as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following
	hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
	upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:




	 





	Level
	1

	– Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.




	 





	Level
	2

	– Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices
	for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated
	by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.




	 





	Level
	3

	– Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market
	participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.




	 




	In
	accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
	other items at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments.




	 







	F-

	6

	 







	 










	 





	As
	of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, the carrying value of accounts payable and loans that are required to be measured at fair
	value, approximated fair value due to the short-term nature and maturity of these instruments.




	 





	Advertising





	 




	Advertising
	expenses are recorded as general and administrative expenses when they are incurred.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
	to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
	and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
	period.  A change in managements’ estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial
	condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
	Wigi4You, Inc.’s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation
	of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.




	 





	Capital
	Stock





	 




	The
	Company has authorized Seventy Five Million (75,000,000) shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001. Seven Million Two
	Hundred and Fifty Thousand (7,250,000) shares and Five Million Two Hundred and Fifty Thousand (5,250,000) shares of common stock
	were issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company recognizes the tax effects of transactions in the year in which such transactions enter into the determination of net
	income, regardless of when reported for tax purposes.




	 





	NOTE
	B – GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable
	to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
	However, the Company does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to
	continue as a going concern.



	 



	Under
	the going concern assumption, an entity is ordinarily viewed as continuing in business for the foreseeable future with neither
	the intention nor the necessity of liquidation, ceasing trading, or seeking protection from creditors pursuant to laws or regulations.
	Accordingly, assets and liabilities are recorded on the basis that the entity will be able to realize its assets and discharge
	its liabilities in the normal course of business.



	 



	The
	ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described
	in the Business paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any
	adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.





	 





	During
	the next year, the Company’s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its
	business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the
	payment of expenses associated with app development. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional
	capital.




	 




	Historically,
	it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds and funds from the sale of shares of stock to finance its operations and
	growth. Management may raise additional capital through future public or private offerings of the Company’s stock or through
	loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company’s
	failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.




	 







	F-

	7

	 







	 









	 




	In
	the past year, the Company funded operations by using cash proceeds received through the issuance of common stock. For the coming
	year, the Company plans to continue to fund the Company through debt and securities sales and issuances until the company generates

	Overview





	 






	Business
	Development






	 




	Wigi4You
	was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014, and our fiscal year end is June 30. The Company's administrative address
	is Derech Magdiel 39/11, Hod-hasharon Israel 45342. The telephone number is:


	1-888-649-8629


	.




	 




	Wigi4You
	has no revenues, and has only limited cash on hand. We have sustained losses since inception and have relied solely upon the sale
	of our securities and loans from our corporate officer and director for funding.




	 




	Wigi4You
	has never declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. Wigi4You, its director, officer,
	and affiliates have not and do not intend to enter into negotiations or discussions with representatives or owners of any other
	businesses or companies regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger.

	The Company
	has no promoters.





	 






	Business
	Plan






	 




	Wigi4You
	is intended to give event planners a fast and easy way to browse, contact, and hire the entertainers and services they need to
	make any event a success. We intend to provide the event planners the ability to subscribe and get quotes for free, book talent,
	venues and more, and then book those services online. Wigi4You will charge a 15% surcharge on every booking made through our application
	or website. The event planner and concierge service will provide an app that will help customers organize, whether for throwing
	a surprise birthday party, organizing a conference, or planning a launch party. Wigi4You will provide a service that not only
	lets customers find events going on around them, but lets them also host and organize their own. From there, the customers can
	collect money for ticket sales and more. It’s also a way to keep guests informed on any changes to the event that may happen.




	 




	Wigi4You
	is intended to be the complete guide to throwing a successful party, and even focuses on special events such as holidays. From
	planning to executing, Wigi4You can walk the client through each step of the event.

	Principal
	Products, Services and Their Markets






	 




	Our
	business plan is to create a website and an independent mobile application that enables consumers to find the best performers,
	entertainers, bands, speakers and event services easily and which are expected to be accessible for everyone in the United States
	and Canada. Whether a first-time event planner or a seasoned professional, customers can book everything needed for a successful
	event in one location. We plan on developing a simple booking platform which will allow for an easy connection between event planner
	and talent. Users will type in the category in which they are interested, so a list of local talent can be provided. We plan on
	allowing users the ability to watch videos and see reviews.




	 




	Wigi4you
	will give event planners a fast and easy way to browse, contact, and hire entertainers and services needed for any event.




	 






	Status
	of Publicly Announced New Products or Services






	 




	Wigi4You
	currently has no new publicly announced products or services.




	 






	Competitive
	Business Conditions and Strategy; Wigi4You’s Position in the Industry






	 




	Wigi4You
	intends to establish itself as a competitive company in the market for event planners. Wigi4You’s main competitors are firms
	offering similar services.




	 






	Outsourcing
	of Software Programmers.







	 





	Wigi4You
	plans to hire independent sub-contractors (programmers and web site developers) to customize the public domain software which
	is planned to be the foundation to our website and mobile application. We believe that these services may be obtained at competitive
	prices from software outsourcing companies operating outside the United States; however we may encounter good programmers at competitive
	rates within the United States. At this time we have no arrangements with any vendors or third parties to obtain hardware, or
	programming.




	 






	Patents,
	Trademarks, Licenses, Agreements or Contracts






	 




	There
	are no aspects of our business plan which require a patent, trademark, or product license. We have not entered into any vendor
	agreements or contracts that give or could give rise to any obligations or concessions.




	 






	Governmental
	Controls, Approval and Licensing Requirements







	 





	None

	.




	 







	Research
	and Development Activities and Costs






	 




	We
	have spent no time on specialized research and development activities, and have no plans to undertake any research or development
	in the future.





	 







	Number
	of Employees






	 




	Wigi4You
	has no employees. Our sole officer and director is donating his time to the development of the Company, and intends to do whatever
	work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of earning revenues. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring
	any additional employees in the near future. We plan to engage independent contractors and sub-contractors to design and develop
	our website, manage our internet marketing efforts.





	 







	Plan
	of Operation






	 




	Wigi4you
	doesn’t have any business activity to generate revenue and also no significant assets. Our executive offices are located
	at Derech MagDiel 39/11, Hold-hasharon Israel 45342. The office is a location at which the Company receives mail, has office services
	and can hold meetings. Our officer, Omri Revivo, works on Company business from his residence in Israel.

	Company’s operating expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 is $26,001 and for the nine months ended March 31,
	2016 is $11,556. Operating expenses for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 consist of General and Administrative Expense $19,001

	Net
	Loss





	 




	During
	the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 the Company recognized net losses of $26,001 and $11,556, respectively.





	 






	Liquidity
	and Capital Resources





	 




	On
	March 31, 2017, we had total current assets of $17,958 which consist of $15,701 in Cash, and $2,257 in prepaid expense. We had
	total current liabilities of $555, which consist of $555 due to related party.




	 




	Historically,
	we have financed our cash flow and operations from the sale of common stock and loan from related party.  Net cash provided
	by financing activities for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 was $9,000, which consist of proceeds for common stock issued
	$9,000. During the nine months ended March 31, 2016 net cash provided by financing activities was $10,000, which consist of common
	stock to be issued $10,000




	 




	We
	have not yet generated any revenue from our operations. We will require additional funds to fully implement our plans. These funds
	may be raised through equity financing, debt financing, or other sources, which may result in the dilution in the equity ownership
	of our shares. We currently do not have any arrangements for additional financing and we may not be able to obtain financing when
	required. Our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain financing, a successful marketing and promotion program and, further
	in the future, achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in
	a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders. Obtaining commercial loans, assuming those loans would
	be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.   We will require additional funds to
	maintain our reporting status with the SEC and remain in good standing with the state of Nevada.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	We
	have incurred net loss since our inception on March 19, 2014 through March 31, 2017 totaling $43,567 and have completed only the
	preliminary stages of our business plan.  We anticipate incurring additional losses before realizing any revenues and
	will depend on additional financing in order to meet our continuing obligations and ultimately, to attain profitability.  Our
	ability to obtain additional financing, whether through the issuance of additional equity or through the assumption of debt, is
	uncertain.  Accordingly, our independent auditors’ report on our financial statements for the year ended June
	30, 2016 includes an explanatory paragraph regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern, including additional
	information contained in the notes to our financial statements describing the circumstances leading to this disclosure.  The
	financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty about our ability to continue our business.

	operations, financial position, or cash flows.

	required by Rule 13a-15/15d-15 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of

	controls and procedures. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Company's management,

	did not provide reasonable assurance that material information related to our Company required to be disclosed in the reports
	that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified

	on required disclosure.




	 




	MANAGEMENT'S
	REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	 




	Management
	is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
	and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management
	and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
	reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting
	includes those policies and procedures that:




	 








	•




	Pertain
	to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect
	the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;





	 






	•



	Provide
	reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
	of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in
	the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being
	made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company;
	and





	 






	•



	Provide
	reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition,
	use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
	statements.






	 




	Management
	assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017 . In making this assessment,
	we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in INTERNAL CONTROL
	-- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.




	 




	Our
	management concluded that, as of March 31, 2017, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the
	criteria in INTERNAL CONTROL -- INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK issued by the COSO.

	public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this annual
	report.




	 




	CHANGES
	IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING




	 




	There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation described above
	during the third quarter ended March 31, 2017 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
	controls over financial reporting.

	 with respect to the Fund means a day, as determined by the Calculation Agent, on which the Relevant Exchange (as defined below) and each Related Exchange (as defined below) with respect to the Fund, or any successor
	thereto, if applicable, are scheduled to be open for trading for their respective regular trading sessions.


	The
	

	Relevant Exchange

	 for the Fund means the primary exchange or quotation system on which shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund are traded, as determined by the Calculation Agent.


	The 

	Related Exchange

	 for the Fund means each exchange or quotation system where trading has a material
	effect (as determined by the Calculation Agent) on the overall market for futures or options contracts relating to the Fund.


	The 

	Calculation Day

	 shall be September 28, 2018. If such day is not a Trading Day, the Calculation Day
	will be postponed to the next succeeding Trading Day. The Calculation Day is also subject to postponement due to the occurrence of a Market Disruption Event (as defined below). If a Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the
	Fund on the Calculation Day, such Calculation Day will be postponed to the first succeeding Trading Day on which a Market Disruption Event has not occurred and is not continuing; however, if such first succeeding Trading Day has not occurred as of
	the eighth Trading Day after the originally scheduled Calculation Day, that eighth Trading Day shall be deemed the Calculation Day. If the Calculation Day has been postponed eight Trading Days after the originally scheduled Calculation Day and a
	Market Disruption Event occurs or is continuing with respect to the Fund on such eighth Trading Day, the Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Price of the Fund on such eighth Trading Day based on its good faith estimate of the value of the
	shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund as of the Close of Trading (as defined below) on such eighth Trading Day. See Market Disruption Events.


	

	Calculation Agent Agreement

	 shall mean the Calculation Agent Agreement dated as of May 29, 2012
	between the Company and the Calculation Agent, as amended from time to time.


	 


	3





	

	Calculation Agent

	 shall mean the Person that has entered into
	the Calculation Agent Agreement with the Company providing for, among other things, the determination of the Ending Price and the Redemption Amount, which term shall, unless the context otherwise requires, include its successors under such
	Calculation Agent Agreement. The initial Calculation Agent shall be Wells Fargo Securities, LLC. Pursuant to the Calculation Agent Agreement, the Company may appoint a different Calculation Agent from time to time after the initial issuance of this
	Security without the consent of the Holder of this Security and without notifying the Holder of this Security.




	Market Disruption Events




	A 

	Market Disruption Event

	 means, with respect to the Fund, any of the following events as
	determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion:


	 




	 


	(A)



	The occurrence or existence of a material suspension of or limitation imposed on trading by the Relevant Exchange or otherwise relating to the
	shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund or any Successor Fund (as defined below) on the Relevant Exchange at any time during the one-hour period that ends at the Close of Trading on such day, whether by reason of movements in price
	exceeding limits permitted by such Relevant Exchange or otherwise.





	 




	 


	(B)



	The occurrence or existence of a material suspension of or limitation imposed on trading by any Related Exchange or otherwise in futures or options
	contracts relating to the shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund or any Successor Fund on any Related Exchange at any time during the one-hour period that ends at the Close of Trading on that day, whether by reason of movements in price
	exceeding limits permitted by the Related Exchange or otherwise.





	 




	 


	(C)



	The occurrence or existence of any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in
	general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund or any Successor Fund on the Relevant Exchange at any time during the one-hour period that ends at the Close of Trading on that day.





	 




	 


	(D)



	The occurrence or existence of any event, other than an early closure, that materially disrupts or impairs the ability of market participants in
	general to effect transactions in, or obtain market values for, futures or options contracts relating to shares (or other applicable securities) of the Fund or any Successor Fund on any Related Exchange at any time during the one-hour period that
	ends at the Close of Trading on that day.





	 




	 


	(E)



	The closure of the Relevant Exchange or any Related Exchange with respect to the Fund or any Successor Fund prior to its Scheduled Closing Time
	unless the earlier closing time is announced by the Relevant Exchange or Related Exchange, as applicable, at least one hour prior to the earlier of (1) the actual closing time for the regular trading session on such Relevant Exchange or Related
	Exchange, as applicable, and (2) the submission deadline for orders to be entered into the





	 


	4







	 



	Relevant Exchange or Related Exchange, as applicable, system for execution at the Close of Trading on that day.





	 




	 


	(F)



	The Relevant Exchange or any Related Exchange with respect to the Fund or any Successor Fund fails to open for trading during its regular trading
	session.





	For purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event has occurred:


	 




	 


	(1)



	

	Close of Trading

	 means the Scheduled Closing Time of the Relevant Exchange with respect to the Fund or any Successor Fund; and





	 




	 


	(2)



	the 

	Scheduled Closing Time

	 of the Relevant Exchange or any Related Exchange on any Trading Day for the Fund or any Successor
	Fund means the scheduled weekday closing time of such Relevant Exchange or Related Exchange on such Trading Day, without regard to after hours or any other trading outside the regular trading session hours.







	Anti-dilution Adjustments Relating to the Fund; Alternate Calculation






	Anti-dilution Adjustments




	The Calculation Agent will adjust the Adjustment Factor with respect to the Fund as specified below if any of the events
	specified below occurs with respect to the Fund and the effective date or ex-dividend date, as applicable, for such event is after the Pricing Date and on or prior to the Calculation Day.


	The adjustments specified below do not cover all events that could affect the Fund. The Calculation Agent may, in its sole
	discretion, make additional adjustments to any terms of this Security upon the occurrence of other events that affect or could potentially affect the market price of, or shareholder rights in, the Fund, with a view to offsetting, to the extent
	practical, any such change, and preserving the relative investment risks of this Security. In addition, the Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, make adjustments or a series of adjustments that differ from those described herein if the
	Calculation Agent determines that such adjustments do not properly reflect the economic consequences of the events specified herein or would not preserve the relative investment risks of this Security. All determinations made by the Calculation
	Agent in making any adjustments to the terms of this Security, including adjustments that are in addition to, or that differ from, those described herein, will be made in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner, with the aim of ensuring an
	equitable result. In determining whether to make any adjustment to the terms of this Security, the Calculation Agent may consider any adjustment made by the Options Clearing Corporation or any other equity derivatives clearing organization on
	options contracts on the Fund.


	 


	5





	For any event described below, the Calculation Agent will not be required to
	adjust the Adjustment Factor unless the adjustment would result in a change to the Adjustment Factor then in effect of at least 0.10%. The Adjustment Factor resulting from any adjustment will be rounded up or down, as appropriate, to the nearest
	one-hundred thousandth.


	 




	 


	(A)




	Stock Splits and Reverse Stock Splits






	If a stock split or reverse stock split has occurred, then once such split has become effective, the Adjustment Factor will
	be adjusted to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the number of securities which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the effective date of such stock split or reverse stock split would have owned
	or been entitled to receive immediately following the applicable effective date.


	 




	 


	(B)




	Stock Dividends






	If a dividend or distribution of shares (or other applicable securities) to which this Security is linked has been made by
	the Fund ratably to all holders of record of such shares (or other applicable security), then the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend date to equal the prior Adjustment Factor plus the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and the
	number of shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund which a holder of one share (or other applicable security) of the Fund before the ex-dividend date would have owned or been entitled to receive immediately following that date; provided,
	however, that no adjustment will be made for a distribution for which the number of securities of the Fund paid or distributed is based on a fixed cash equivalent value.


	 




	 


	(C)




	Extraordinary Dividends






	If an Extraordinary Dividend (as defined below) has occurred, then the Adjustment Factor will be adjusted on the ex-dividend
	date to equal the product of the prior Adjustment Factor and a fraction, the numerator of which is the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date, and the denominator of which
	is the amount by which the Closing Price per share (or other applicable security) of the Fund on the Trading Day preceding the ex-dividend date exceeds the Extraordinary Dividend Amount (as defined below).


	For purposes of determining whether an Extraordinary Dividend has occurred:


	 




	 


	(1)



	

	Extraordinary Dividend

	 means any cash dividend or distribution (or portion thereof) that the Calculation Agent determines, in
	its sole discretion, is extraordinary or special; and





	 




	 


	(2)



	

	Extraordinary Dividend Amount

	 with respect to an Extraordinary Dividend for the securities of the Fund will equal the amount per
	share (or other applicable security) of the Fund of the applicable cash dividend or





	 


	6





	distribution that is attributable to the Extraordinary Dividend, as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole discretion.


	A distribution on the securities of the Fund described below under the section entitled Reorganization
	Events below that also constitutes an Extraordinary Dividend will only cause an adjustment pursuant to that Reorganization Events section.


	 




	 


	(D)




	Other Distributions






	If the Fund declares or makes a distribution to all holders of the shares (or other applicable security) of the Fund of any
	non-cash assets, excluding dividends or distributions described under the section entitled Stock Dividends above, then the Calculation Agent may, in its sole discretion, make such adjustment (if any) to the Adjustment Factor as it
	deems appropriate in the circumstances. If the Calculation Agent determines to make an adjustment pursuant to this paragraph, it will do so with a view to offsetting, to the extent practical, any change in the economic position of a holder of this
	Security that results solely from the applicable event.


	 




	 


	(E)




	Reorganization Events






	If the Fund, or any Successor Fund, is subject to a merger, combination, consolidation or statutory exchange of securities
	with another exchange traded fund, and the Fund to which this Security is linked is not the surviving entity (a 

	Reorganization Event

	), then, on or after the date of such event, the Calculation Agent shall, in its sole discretion,
	make an adjustment to the Adjustment Factor or the method of determining the Redemption Amount or any other terms of this Security as the Calculation Agent determines appropriate to account for the economic effect on this Security of such event, and
	determine the effective date of that adjustment. If the Calculation Agent determines that no adjustment that it could make will produce a commercially reasonable result, then the Calculation Agent may deem such event a Liquidation Event (as defined
	below).




	Liquidation Events




	If the Fund is de-listed, liquidated or otherwise terminated (a 

	Liquidation Event

	), and a successor or
	substitute exchange traded fund exists that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion, to be comparable to the Fund, then, upon the Calculation Agents notification of that determination to the Trustee and the Company, any
	subsequent Fund Closing Price for the Fund will be determined by reference to the Fund Closing Price of such successor or substitute exchange traded fund (such exchange traded fund being referred to herein as a 

	Successor Fund

	),
	with such adjustments as the Calculation Agent determines are appropriate to account for the economic effect of such substitution on the holder of this Security.


	If the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event prior to, and such Liquidation Event is continuing on, the date that any Fund
	Closing Price of the Fund is to be determined and the


	 


	7





	Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Fund is available at such time, then the Calculation Agent will, in its discretion, calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund on such date by a
	computation methodology that the Calculation Agent determines will as closely as reasonably possible replicate the Fund, provided that if the Calculation Agent determines in its discretion that it is not practicable to replicate the Fund (including
	but not limited to the instance in which the sponsor of the index underlying the Fund discontinues publication of that index), then the Calculation Agent will calculate the Fund Closing Price for the Fund in accordance with the formula last used to
	calculate such Fund Closing Price before such Liquidation Event, but using only those securities that were held by the Fund immediately prior to such Liquidation Event without any rebalancing or substitution of such securities following such
	Liquidation Event.


	If a Successor Fund is selected or the Calculation Agent calculates the Fund Closing Price as a
	substitute for the Fund, such Successor Fund or Fund Closing Price will be used as a substitute for the Fund for all purposes, including for purposes of determining whether a Market Disruption Event exists.


	If any event is both a Reorganization Event and a Liquidation Event, such event will be treated as a Reorganization Event for
	purposes of this Security unless the Calculation Agent makes the determination referenced in the last sentence of the section entitled Anti-dilution AdjustmentsReorganization Events above.




	Alternate Calculation




	If at any time the method of calculating the Fund or a Successor Fund, or the Underlying Index, is changed in a material
	respect, or if the Fund or a Successor Fund is in any other way modified so that the Fund does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent, fairly represent the price of the securities of the Fund or such Successor Fund had such changes or
	modifications not been made, then the Calculation Agent may, at the close of business in New York City on the date that any Fund Closing Price is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments as, in the good faith judgment of the
	Calculation Agent, may be necessary in order to arrive at a Closing Price of an exchange traded fund comparable to the Fund or such Successor Fund, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not been made, and calculate the Fund
	Closing Price and the Redemption Amount with reference to such adjusted Closing Price of the Fund or such Successor Fund, as applicable.




	Calculation Agent




	The Calculation Agent will determine the Redemption Amount and the Ending Price. In addition, the Calculation Agent will
	(i) determine if adjustments are required to the Fund Closing Price and/or the Adjustment Factor under the circumstances described in this Security, (ii) if the Fund undergoes a Liquidation Event, select a Successor Fund or, if no
	Successor Fund is available, determine the Fund Closing Price of the Fund, and (iii) determine whether a Market Disruption Event or non-Trading Day has occurred.

	The Company covenants that, so long as this Security is Outstanding, there shall
	at all times be a Calculation Agent (which shall be a

	broker-dealer,

	bank or other financial institution) with respect to this Security.


	All determinations made by the Calculation Agent with respect to this Security will be at the sole discretion of the
	Calculation Agent and, in the absence of manifest error, will be conclusive for all purposes and binding on the Company and the Holder of this Security.




	Tax Considerations




	The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial ownership interest in this Security each Holder of this Security will be
	deemed to have agreed (in the absence of a statutory, regulatory, administrative or judicial ruling to the contrary), for United States federal income tax purposes to treat this Security as a prepaid derivative contract that is an open
	transaction.




	Redemption and Repayment




	This Security is not subject to redemption at the option of the Company or repayment at the option of the Holder hereof prior
	to October 5, 2018. This Security is not entitled to any sinking fund.




	Acceleration




	If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to this Security shall occur and be continuing, the
	Redemption Amount (calculated as set forth in the next sentence) of this Security may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration permitted
	under the Indenture will be equal to the Redemption Amount hereof calculated as provided herein as though the date of acceleration was the Calculation Day.


	 



	 



	Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions
	shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth at this place.


	Unless the certificate of authentication
	hereon has been executed by the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature or its duly authorized agent under the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature, this Security shall not be entitled to any benefit
	under the Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.

	MEDIUM-TERM

	Due Nine Months or More From Date of Issue




	Principal at Risk Securities Linked to the SPDR

	®

	S&P 500

	®

	ETF Trust due October 5, 2018



	This Security is one of a
	duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the 

	Securities

	), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an indenture dated as of July 21, 1999, as amended or supplemented from time to time
	(herein called the 

	Indenture

	), between the Company and Citibank, N.A., as Trustee (herein called the 

	Trustee

	, which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to which Indenture and all indentures
	supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities
	are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series of the Securities designated as Medium-Term Notes, Series K, of the Company, which series is limited to an aggregate principal amount or face amount, as applicable,
	of $25,000,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one or more foreign or composite currencies. The amount payable on the Securities of this series may be determined by reference to the performance of one or more equity-, commodity- or currency-based
	indices, exchange traded funds, securities, commodities, currencies, statistical measures of economic or financial performance, or a basket comprised of two or more of the foregoing, or any other market measure or may bear interest at a fixed rate
	or a floating rate. The Securities of this series may mature at different times, be redeemable at different times or not at all, be repayable at the option of the Holder at different times or not at all and be denominated in different currencies.


	Article Sixteen of the Indenture shall not apply to this Security.


	The Securities are issuable only in registered form without coupons and will be either

	(a) book-entry

	securities represented by one or more Global Securities recorded in the

	book-entry

	system maintained by the Depositary or (b) certificated
	securities issued to and registered in the names of, the beneficial owners or their nominees.


	The Company agrees, to the
	extent permitted by law, not to voluntarily claim the benefits of any laws concerning usurious rates of interest against a Holder of this Security.




	Modification and Waivers




	The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights
	and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
	Securities at the


	 


	11





	time Outstanding of all series to be affected, acting together as a class. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of all
	series at the time Outstanding affected by certain provisions of the Indenture, acting together as a class, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with those provisions of the Indenture. Certain
	past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences may be waived under the Indenture by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such
	series. Solely for the purpose of determining whether any consent, waiver, notice or other action or Act to be taken or given by the Holders of Securities pursuant to the Indenture has been given or taken by the Holders of Outstanding Securities in
	the requisite aggregate principal amount, the principal amount of this Security will be deemed to be equal to the amount set forth on the face hereof as the Face Amount hereof. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security
	shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or
	waiver is made upon this Security.




	Defeasance




	Section 403 and Article Fifteen of the Indenture and the provisions of clause (ii) of Section 401(1)(B) of the
	Indenture, relating to defeasance at any time of (a) the entire indebtedness on this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants and certain Events of Default, upon compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein,
	shall not apply to this Security. The remaining provisions of Section 401 of the Indenture shall apply to this Security.




	Authorized
	Denominations




	This Security is issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 or any
	amount in excess thereof which is an integral multiple of $1,000.




	Registration of Transfer




	Upon due presentment for registration of transfer of this Security at the office or agency of the Company in the City of
	Minneapolis, Minnesota, a new Security or Securities of this series, with the same terms as this Security, in authorized denominations for an equal aggregate Face Amount will be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor, as provided in the
	Indenture and subject to the limitations provided therein and to the limitations described below, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.


	This Security is exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form only if (x) the Depositary notifies the
	Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor depositary is not
	appointed within 90 days after the Company receives such notice or becomes aware of such ineligibility, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Security shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities in registered form
	and notifies the Trustee thereof or (z) an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented hereby has occurred and is continuing. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for
	definitive Securities in registered


	 


	12





	form, having the same date of issuance, Stated Maturity Date and other terms and of authorized denominations aggregating a like amount.


	This Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary to a nominee of the Depositary or by a nominee of the
	Depositary to the Depositary or another nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor of the Depositary or a nominee of such successor. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this Global
	Security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the Holders hereof for any purpose under the Indenture.


	Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
	or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
	contrary.




	Obligation of the Company Absolute




	No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation
	of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the Redemption Amount at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed, except as otherwise provided in this Security.




	No Personal Recourse




	No recourse shall be had for the payment of the Redemption Amount, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect
	hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or any successor corporation, whether by virtue of
	any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly waived and released.




	Defined Terms




	All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture
	unless otherwise defined in this Security.




	Governing Law




	This Security shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, without regard to
	principles of conflicts of laws.

	Ladies and Gentlemen:


	We have
	acted as counsel for Wells Fargo & Company, a Delaware corporation (the Company), in connection with (i) the preparation of a Registration Statement on

	Form S-3,

	File
	No. 333-180728 (the Registration Statement) of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), relating to the
	proposed offer and sale from time to time of the securities referred to therein; and (ii) Pricing Supplement No. 467 dated December 30, 2014 to Product Supplement No. 3 dated May 2, 2012, the Prospectus Supplement dated
	April 13, 2012 and the Prospectus dated April 13, 2012, relating to the offer and sale by the Company under the Registration Statement of $2,424,000 aggregate face amount of Medium-Term Notes, Series K, Principal at Risk Securities
	Linked to the SPDR

	®

	S&P 500

	®

	ETF Trust due October 5, 2018 (the Medium-Term Notes described in this clause (ii) being
	herein referred to as the Notes). The Notes are to be issued under the Indenture dated as of July 21, 1999 (the Indenture) entered into by the Company and Citibank, N.A., as trustee, and sold pursuant to the Terms
	Agreement dated December 30, 2014 between the Company and the Agent named therein (the Terms Agreement).


	We have examined such documents, records and instruments as we have deemed necessary or appropriate for the purposes of this
	opinion.


	Based on the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Notes have been duly authorized and, when duly executed
	by the Company, authenticated in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, and delivered to and paid for by the Agent pursuant to the Terms Agreement, the Notes will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
	against the Company in accordance with their terms subject to applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance, receivership or other laws affecting creditors rights generally from time to time in effect and
	subject to general equity principles including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable remedies (regardless
	of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by any governmental authority that limits,

	requirements that are applicable to it to the extent necessary to make such agreements or instruments enforceable against it; (iii) each party to agreements or instruments relevant hereto other than the Company has complied with all legal
	requirements pertaining to its status as such status relates to its rights to enforce such agreements or instruments against the Company; and (iv) each document submitted to us for review is accurate and complete, each such document that is an
	original is authentic, each such document that is a copy conforms to an authentic original, and all signatures on each such document are genuine.


	The opinions expressed herein are limited to the specific issues addressed and to documents and laws existing on the date
	hereof. By rendering our opinion, we do not undertake to advise you with respect to any other matter or of any change in such documents and laws or in the interpretation thereof which may occur after the date hereof.


	Our opinions set forth herein are limited to the laws of the State of New York, the General Corporation Law of the State of
	Delaware and the federal laws of the United States of America, and we are expressing no opinion as to the effect of any other laws.


	We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to a Current Report on

	Form 8-K

	of the Company filed with the Commission and thereby incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of

The following table details the Company’s intended use of proceeds from the
Company Offering, for the first twelve (12) months after successful completion
of the Company Offering. None of the expenditures itemized is listed in any
particular order of priority or importance. Since the Company does not intend to
pay any Offering expenses from the proceeds from the Company Offering, and
assuming that $50,000 (100%), $37,500 (75%), $25,000 (50%), or $12,500 (25%) of
the Company Offering is sold, the net aggregate proceeds will be allocated as
follows:

Expenditure Item**                         100 %         75 %         50 %         25 %
Professional Fees                     $ 13,000     $  9.750     $  6,500     $  3,250  
Advertising and Marketing             $ 10,000     $  7,500     $  9,500     $  2,500  
Design Software and Web Application   $ 21,000     $ 15,750     $ 10,500     $  5,250  
                                                                                       
Office and Miscellaneous Expenses     $  6,000     $  4,500     $  3,000     $  1,500  
Total                                 $ 50,000     $ 37,500     $ 25,000     $ 12,500  

There is no minimum amount we are required to raise in this Offering, no
expenses associated with this Offering will be paid by the Company, and any 
funds received from the sale of stock by the Company will be immediately
available to us.

* Since the web design and software adaptation are critical to our success, if
  we do not successfully sell 50% of the Company Offering, we will depend on 
  other funding to complete the project, such as loans from our officers or
  shareholders.

**The above expenditures are defined as follows:

Professional Fees: Pertains to legal services and accounting fees that will be
incurred by the company.

Costs Associated with being a Public Company: Pertains to filing fees associated
with Edgar filings, stock transfer agent fees, and other miscellaneous fees.

Advertising and Marketing: Pertains to the cost of advertising and marketing our
services.

Design Software and Web Application: Pertains to the development of our software
and applications and integrating it with the web site.

Office and Miscellaneous Expenses: These are the costs of operating our office
including telephone services, mail, stationary, accounting, office supplies,
bank service fees and charges, and other miscellaneous expenses associated with
running our office.

Working Capital: Pertains to the funds allocated to general working capital.

There is no assurance that we will be able to raise the entire $50,000 from the
sale of stock by the Company under this Offering. Therefore, the following
details how we will use the proceeds if we raise only 75%, 50%, or 25% of this
Offering:

If 75% of this Offering is sold, we estimate that this would provide sufficient
capital to begin operations and develop our business plan. It may, however,
place potential restraints on our ability to handle unforeseen expenses
attributable to Working Capital and may require us to seek additional funding.

If only 50% of this Offering is sold, we estimate that this would provide
sufficient capital to commence with operation and development of the business
plan, but we would only be able to spend $5,000 to spend on advertising and
marketing our services. Under this scenario, we estimate that we would be able
to generate enough revenues to sustain our business. Should we be unable to
generate sufficient revenues to sustain our business, we will have to find other
sources of financing.

If we raise less than 50% we will have difficulty in implementing our business
plan. Our expenses would be prioritized in order of importance and would affect
how we allocate funds for developing the business. If less than 50% is raised,
we would be able to develop our website with less features and we would not be
able to allocate any funds to advertising and marketing.

If only 25% of the Offering is sold, we would still incur expected professional
(legal and accounting) fees of $3,250, which will have to be paid to maintain
reporting status during the next 12 months. We will not be able to apply
sufficient funds to any other areas of developing our business, such as
advertising and marketing, and would only provide a minimal amount to develop
the website and software. This would seriously hinder the development of our
business and our ability to generate revenues. We would not be able to develop
the business and/or generate any revenues in the first year without additional
financing.


The business of an application providing a comprehensive entire package of event
planning and concierge services is very competitive. Barriers to entry on the
Internet are relatively low, and we face competitive pressures from companies
anxious to join this niche. There are a number of successful websites operated
by proven companies that offer similar niche social networking to event planning
service which may prevent us from gaining enough market share to become
successful. These competitors have existing customers that may form a large part
of our targeted client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over
from already established competitors to our service. If we cannot gain enough
market share, our business and our financial performance will be adversely
affected.


Company Description
Wigi4You is intended to give event planners a fast and easy way to browse,
contact, and hire the entertainers and services they need to make any event a
success. We intend to provide the event planners the ability to subscribe and
get quotes for free, book talent, venues and more, and then book


 those services
online. Wigi4You will receive charge a 15% surcharge on every booking made
through our application or website. The event planner and concierge service will
provide an app that will help customers organize, whether for throwing a
surprise birthday party, organizing a conference, or planning a launch party.
Wigi4You will provide a service that not only lets customers find events going
on around them, but lets them also host and organize their own. From there, the
customers can collect money for ticket sales and more. It’s also a way to keep
guests informed on any changes to the event that may happen.

Wigi4You is intended to be the complete guide to throwing a successful party,
and even focuses on special events such as holidays. From planning to executing,
Wigi4You can walk the client through each step of the event.

Forward-Looking
Statements

 

This
report includes “forward-looking statements” within the
meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, as amended.  All statements other than statements
of historical facts are “forward-looking statements”
for purposes of these provisions, including any projections of
earnings, revenues or other financial items, any statement of the
plans and objectives of management for future operations, any
statements concerning proposed new products or strategic
arrangements, any statements regarding future economic conditions
or performance, and any statement of assumptions underlying any of
the foregoing.  In some cases, forward-looking statements
can be identified by the use of terminology such as
“may,” “will,” “expects,”
“plans,” “anticipates,”
“estimates,” “potential,”
“intends”, or “continue” or the negative
thereof or other comparable terminology.  Although the
Company and its management believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable,
there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the
forward-looking statements will prove to be correct, and actual
results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in
the forward-looking statements.  The Company’s
future financial condition and results of operations, as well as
any forward-looking statements, are subject to inherent risks and
uncertainties, including but not limited to the Risk Factors set
forth under Item 1A, and for the reasons described elsewhere
in this report. All forward-looking statements and reasons why
results may differ included in this report are made as of the date
hereof, and we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking
statements or reasons why actual results might differ.

  


PART
I

 


Item 1.
Business

 

Overview

 

Wigi4You
was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 19, 2014. Wigi4You
intends to provide a website and mobile app to assist event
planners in locating performers, bands and speakers, booking
locations and planning events in areas around the United States and
Canada.

 

Wigi4You’s
business and corporate address is Derech Magdiel 39/11,
Hod-hasharon, Israel 45342, and our telephone number is
1-888-649-8629. Our registered agent for service of process is
State Agent and Transfer Syndicate, Inc., 112 North Curry Street,
Carson City, Nevada 89703-4934. Our fiscal year end is June
30.

 

Our
business is in the start-up phase, and we have no operational
history. To date, we have generated no revenues from operations and
cannot guarantee we will generate revenues in the
future.

 

At the
present time, we are classified as a “shell company”
under Rule 405 of the Securities Act Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange
Act. As such, all restricted securities presently held by the
affiliates of our company may not be resold in reliance on Rule 144
until: (1) we file Form 10 information with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”) when we cease to be a
“shell company”; (2) we have filed all reports as
required by Section 13 and 15(d) of the Securities Act for twelve
consecutive months; and (3) one year has elapsed from the time we
file the current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting
our status as an entity that is not a shell company.

 

Bankruptcy
Or Similar Proceedings

 

There has
been no bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding involving
the Company.

 

Reorganization,
Purchase Or Sale Of Assets

 

There have
been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations, or
purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets involving the
Company.

Effect Of
Existing Or Probable Governmental Regulations On The
Business

 

The
Company will be subject to numerous national, international,
regional, state and local laws. The Company does not know when or
whether additional legislation may pass or whether any such
legislation would relate to the types of services currently planned
to be provided by the Company or which the Company intends to
develop. Accordingly, the Company cannot predict the effect, if
any, that any such future regulation may have on its
business.

 

Research
And Development Activities During The Last Two Years

 

We have
not expended funds for research and development costs since
inception.

 

Outsourcing
Of Software Programmers.

 

Wigi4You
plans to hire independent sub-contractors (programmers and web site
developers) to customize the public domain software that will be
the foundation to our website and mobile application. We believe
that these services may be obtained at competitive prices from
software outsourcing companies operating in the United States;
however we may encounter good programmers at competitive rates
within the United States. At this time we have no arrangements with
any vendors or third parties to obtain hardware, or
programming.

 

Number Of
Total Employees And Number Of Full Time Employees

 

Wigi4You
has no employees. Our sole officer and director is donating his
time to the development of the Company, and intends to do whatever
work is necessary in order to bring us to the point of earning
revenues. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring any
additional employees in the near future. We will be engaging
independent contractors and sub-contractors to design and develop
our website, manage our internet marketing efforts.

 


Item 1A.
Risk Factors

 

An
investment in these securities involves a high degree of risk and
is speculative in nature. In addition to the other information
regarding the Company contained in this Prospectus, you should
consider many important factors in determining whether to purchase
Shares. Following are what we believe are material risks related to
the Company and an investment in the Company. Investors are urged
to perform their own due diligence, with the help of their
investment, accounting, legal and/or other professionals and to
make an independent decision regarding an investment in the
Shares. 

 

RISKS
ASSOCIATED WITH OUR BUSINESS

 

Our
independent auditors have issued an audit opinion for Wigi4You
which includes a statement describing our going concern status. Our
financial status creates a doubt whether we will continue as a
going concern.

 

As
described in Note B of our accompanying financial statements, our
auditors have issued a going concern opinion regarding the Company.
This means there is substantial doubt we can continue as an ongoing
business for the next twelve months. The financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the uncertainty
regarding our ability to continue in business. As such, we may have
to cease operations and investors could lose part or all of their
investment in the Company.

 

We lack an
operating history and have losses which we expect to continue into
the future. There is no assurance our future operations will result
in profitable revenues. If we cannot generate sufficient revenues
to operate profitably, we may suspend or cease
operations.

 

We were
incorporated on March 19, 2014, and we have not fully developed our
proposed business operations and have realized no revenues. We have
no operating history upon which an evaluation of our future success
or failure can be made. Our net loss for the years ended June 30,
2016 and 2015, was $16,063 and $948, respectively, most of which is
for professional fees. Our ability to achieve and maintain
profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon:

 




 



•



Completion
of the share offering,




 

 




 



3



 




  

 

 




 



•



Our
ability to attract customers who will use our services,




 




 



•



Our
ability to generate revenue through the sale of our
services.




 

Based upon
current plans, we expect to incur operating losses in future
periods because we will be incurring expenses and not generating
revenues. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
generating revenues in the future. In the event the Company is
unable to generate revenues, it may be required to seek additional
funding. Such funding may not be available, or may not be available
on terms which are beneficial and/or acceptable to the Company. In
the event the Company cannot generate revenues and/or secure
additional financing, the Company may be forced to cease operations
and investors will likely lose some or all of their investment in
the Company.

 

Because
management does not have relevant experience in managing a software
and electronic products company, our business has a higher risk of
failure.

 

Our sole
officer and director has limited business experience related to the
marketing and development of event planning and concierge services
and applications. Consequently, management will initially have to
rely on the experience of third parties. Further, we have budgeted
only $10,000 toward sales and marketing efforts over the next 12
months, which by industry standards is a very limited amount of
capital with which to launch our effort. Given the relatively small
marketing budget and limited experience of our officers, there can
be no assurance that such efforts will be successful. Further, if
our initial efforts to create a market for our website are not
successful, there can be no assurance that we will be able to
attract and retain qualified individuals with marketing and sales
expertise to attract subscribers to our website. Our future success
will depend, amount other factors, upon whether our services can be
sold at a profitable price and the extent to which consumers
acquire, adopt, and continue to use them. There can be no assurance
that our application will gain wide acceptance in its targeted
markets or that we will be able to effectively market our services.
There can be no assurance that they will be successful in obtaining
adequate assistance or cooperation from third parties at a cost
consistent with the resources of the Company.

 

We have no
clients or customers and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any.
Even if we obtain clients or customers, there is no assurance that
we will make a profit.

 

We have no
clients or customers. We have not identified any clients or
customers and we cannot guarantee we will ever have any. Even if we
obtain clients or customers for our services, there is no guarantee
that we will develop products and/or services that our
clients/customers will want to use. If we are unable to attract
enough customers/clients to purchase services (and any products we
may develop or sell) it will have a negative effect on our ability
to generate sufficient revenue from which we can operate or expand
our business. The lack of sufficient revenues will have a negative
effect on the ability of the Company to continue operations and it
could force the Company to cease operations.

 

Some of
our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing
resources than do we.

 

There
exists in our industry many competitors that have significantly
greater financial and marketing resources than do we. There are no
assurances that our efforts to compete in the marketplace will be
successful. We are a relatively late entry into a mature market for
electronic concierge services and applications. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to develop a profitable niche in
this market.

 

We are in
a competitive market which could impact our ability to gain market
share which could harm our financial
performance.

 

The
business of an application providing a comprehensive entire package
of event planning and concierge services is very competitive.
Barriers to entry on the Internet are relatively low, and we face
competitive pressures from companies anxious to join this niche.
There are a number of successful websites operated by proven
companies that offer similar niche social networking to event
planning service which may prevent us from gaining enough market
share to become successful.  These competitors have
existing customers that may form a large part of our targeted
client base, and such clients may be hesitant to switch over from
already established competitors to our service.  If we
cannot gain enough market share, our business and our financial
performance will be adversely affected.

We do not
have any additional source of funding for our business plans and
may be unable to find any such funding if and when needed,
resulting in the failure of our business.

 

Other than
the shares offered no other source of capital has been identified
or sought. As a result we do not have an alternate source of funds.
If we do find an alternative source of capital, the terms and
conditions of acquiring such capital may result in dilution and the
resultant lessening of value of the shares of stockholders. As
widely reported, the global and domestic financial markets have
been extremely volatile in recent months. If such conditions and
constraints continue or if there is no investor appetite to finance
our specific business, we may not be able to acquire additional
financing through credit markets or equity markets. Even if
additional financial is available, it may not be available on terms
favorable to us. At this time, we have not identified or secured
sources of additional financing. Our failure to secure additional
financing when it becomes required will have an adverse effect on
our ability to remain in business.

 

If we are
not successful in raising sufficient fund, we will be faced with
several options:

 

1. abandon
our business plans, cease operations and go out of
business;

 

2.
continue to seek alternative and acceptable sources of capital;
or

 

3. bring
in additional capital that may result in a change of
control.

  

We possess
minimal capital, which may severely restrict our ability to develop
our services. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our
business will fail .

 

We possess
minimal capital and must limit the amount of marketing we can
perform with respect to our services. We feel we require a minimum
of $12,500 to provide sufficient capital to commence with
operations and development of the business plan. Our business plan
contemplates the development of a website and associated software
to assist users to find local events, performers, bands and
speakers. Our limited marketing activities may not attract enough
clients to generate sufficient revenue to operate profitably,
expand our services, implement our business plan or continue
operating our business. Our limited marketing capabilities may have
a negative effect on our business and may cause us to limit or
cease our business operations which could result in investors
losing some or all of their investment in the Company.

 

If our
estimates related to future expenditures are erroneous or
inaccurate, our business will fail and you could lose your entire
investment.

 

Our
success is dependent in part upon the accuracy of our
management’s estimates of our future cost expenditures for
legal and accounting services (including those we expect to incur
as a publicly reporting company), for website marketing and
development expenses, and for administrative expenses, which
management estimates to be approximately between $25,000 and
$45,000 over the next twelve months. If such estimates are
erroneous or inaccurate, or if we encounter unforeseen costs, we
may not be able to carry out our business plan, which could result
in the failure of our business and the loss of your entire
investment.

 

Our
auditor has raised substantial doubts about our ability to continue
as a going concern and if we are unable to continue our business,
our shares may have little or no value.

 

The
company’s ability to become a profitable operating company is
dependent upon its ability to generate revenues and/or obtain
financing adequate to fulfill its research and market introduction
activities, and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support
our cost structure has raised substantial doubts about our ability
to continue as a going concern. We plan to attempt to raise
additional equity capital by selling shares and, if necessary,
through one or more private placement or public
offerings.

 

However,
the doubts raised, relating to our ability to continue as a going
concern, may make our shares an unattractive investment for
potential investors. These factors, among others, may make it
difficult to raise any additional capital.

Any
significant disruption in our website presence or services could
result in a loss of customers.

 

Our plans
call for our customers to access our service through our website.
Our reputation and ability to attract, retain and serve our
customers will be dependent upon the reliable performance of our
website, network infrastructure and fulfillment processes (how we
deliver services purchased by our customers). Prolonged or frequent
interruptions in any of these systems could make our website
unavailable or unusable, which could diminish the overall
attractiveness of our subscription service to existing and
potential customers.

 

Our
servers will likely be vulnerable to computer viruses, physical or
electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to
interruptions and delays in our service and operations and loss,
misuse or theft of data. It is likely that our website will
periodically experience directed attacks intended to cause a
disruption in service, which is not uncommon for web-based
businesses. Any attempts by hackers to disrupt our website service
or our internal systems, if successful, could harm our business, be
expensive to remedy and damage our reputation.  Efforts
to prevent hackers from entering our computer systems are expensive
to implement and may limit the functionality of our services. Any
significant disruption to our website or internal computer systems
could result in a loss of subscribers and adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

 

The loss
of the services of either our sole officer and director or our
failure to timely identify and retain competent personnel could
negatively impact our ability to develop our website and sell our
services.

 

The
development of our website and the marketing of our services will
continue to place a significant strain on our limited personnel,
management, and other resources. Our future success depends upon
the continued services of our executive officer, Omri Revivo, who
is developing our business, and on our ability to identify and
retain competent consultants and employees with the skills required
to execute our business objectives. The loss of the services of
officer or our failure to timely identify and retain competent
personnel could negatively impact our ability to develop our
website and sell our services, which could adversely affect our
financial results and impair our growth.

  
 

Our sole
officer and director may have conflicts of interest in that he has
other time commitments that will prevent him from devoting
full-time to our operations, which may affect our
operations .

 

Because
our sole officer and director, who is responsible for all our
business activities, will not devote his full working time to
operations and management of us, the implementation of our business
plans may be impeded. Our officer and director has other
obligations and time commitments, which will slow our operations
and may reduce our financial results and as a result, we may not be
able to continue with our operations. Mr. Revivo will devote 10
hours per week. Additionally, when he becomes unable to handle the
daily operations on his own, we may not be able to hire additional
qualified personnel to replace him in a timely manner. If this
event should occur, we may not be able to reach profitable, which
might result in the loss of some or all of your investment in our
common stock.

 

We are
dependent upon our current officer.

 

We
currently are managed by one officer and we are entirely dependent
upon him in order to conduct our operations. If he should resign or
die, there will be no one to run Wigi4You, and the company has no
Key Man insurance. If our current officer is no longer able to
serve as such and we are unable to find other persons to replace
him, it will have a negative effect on our ability to continue
active business operations and could result in investors losing
some or all of their investment in the Company.

 

Our
business model may require the use of outside personnel, who may
not be available when needed.

 

We will
require the service of software programmers. We intend to obtain
these services through software outsourcing companies operating in
the United States and Israel. Software outsourcing companies
contract with programmers in countries such as Pakistan, Malaysia,
China, the Philippines, Israel, Ireland, Mexico, Russia and Chile.
These countries offer low costs, well trained personnel with
English language capabilities. The services of offshore programmers
may be overseen by third party outsourcing companies whose
performance is beyond our control. We cannot reliably predict if
the services will be available as we need them.

There is a
potential security risk using foreign
programmers

 

We will
make reasonable efforts to assure that the outsourcing companies
have verifiable security procedures in place, however, by
outsourcing we face the potential loss of control under which our
software is developed. Without programmers of our own, we will rely
on the integrity of the outsourcing company to examine source code
to assure that there are no potential security risks.

 

Our
controlling stockholders have significant influence over the
Company.

 

As of June
30, 2016, Omri Revivo, our sole officer and director, owns 100% of
the outstanding common stock, which becomes 72.4% if all of the
shares offered are sold. As a result, Revivo possesses significant
influence over our affairs. His stock ownership and relationships
with members of our board of directors, of which Mr. Revivo is the
only one, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a future
change in control, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or
other business combination or discouraging a potential acquirer
from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain
control of the Company, which in turn could materially and
adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

 

One
investor hold a controlling interest in our stock. As a result, the
ability of minority shareholders to influence our affairs is
extremely limited.

 

Our
President owns a controlling interest in our outstanding common
stock. He has the ability to control all matters submitted to the
stockholders of Wigi4You for approval (including the election and
removal of directors). A significant change to the composition of
our board could lead to a change in management and our business
plan. Any such transition could lead to, among other things, a
decline in service levels, disruption in our operations and
departures of key personnel, which could in turn harm our
business.

 

Moreover,
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying,
deferring or preventing a change in control, impeding a merger,
consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us,
or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or
otherwise attempting to obtain control, which in turn could
materially and adversely affect the market price of the common
stock.

 

Having
only one director limits our ability to establish effective
independent corporate governance procedures and increases the
control of our president over operations and business
decisions.

 

We have
only one director, who is our principal executive officer and
secretary. Accordingly, we cannot establish board committees
comprised of independent members to oversee functions like
compensation or audit issues.

 

Until we
have a larger board of directors that would include some
independent members, if ever, there will be limited oversight of
our president’s decisions and activities and little ability
for minority shareholders to challenge or reverse those activities
and decisions, even if they are not in the best interests of
minority shareholders.

 

The lack
of public company experience of our management could adversely
impact our ability to comply with the reporting requirements of
U.S. Securities Laws.

 

Our
management lacks public company experience, which could impair our
ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements such as
those imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our management has
never been responsible for managing a publicly traded company. Such
responsibilities include complying with federal securities laws and
making required disclosures on a timely basis. Our management may
not be able to implement programs and policies in an effective and
timely manner that adequately responds to such increased legal,
regulatory compliance and reporting requirements including
establishing and maintaining internal controls over financials
reporting. Any such deficiencies, weaknesses or lack of compliance
could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to comply
with the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) which is
necessary to maintain our public company status. If we were to fail
to fulfill those obligations, our ability to continue as a U.S.
public company would be in jeopardy in which event you could lose
your entire investment.

Because we
are currently considered a “shell company” within the
meaning of Rule 12B-2 pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the ability of holders of our common stock to sell their
shares may be limited by applicable regulations.

 

We are
currently considered a “shell company” as that term is
defined in Rule 12b-2 pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and Rule 405 pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, in that
we currently have nominal operations and nominal assets other than
cash. Accordingly, the ability of holders of our common stock to
sell their shares may be limited by applicable
regulations.

 

As a
result of our classification as a “shell company”, our
investors are not allowed to rely on the “safe harbor”
provisions of Rule 144 promulgated pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 so as not to be considered underwriters in connection with
the sale of securities until one year from the date that we cease
to be a “shell company.” Additionally, as a result of
our classification a shell company:

 




 



•



Investors
should consider shares of our common stock to be significantly
risky and illiquid investments.




 




 



•



We may not
register our securities on Form S-8 (an abbreviated form of
registration statement).




 




 



•



Our
ability to attract additional funding to sustain our operations may
be limited significantly.




 
 

We can
provide no assurance or guarantee that we will cease to be a
“shell company” and, accordingly, we can provide no
assurance or guarantee that there will be a liquid market for our
shares. Accordingly, investors may not be able to sell our shares
and lose their investments in the Company.

 

We do not
expect to file a Form 8-A on a pre-effective basis. Because our
common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, we will not
be subject to the federal proxy rules and our directors, executive
officers and 10% beneficial holders will not be subject to section
16 of the Exchange Act. In addition, our reporting obligations
under section 15(d) of the Exchange Act may be suspended
automatically if we have fewer than 300 shareholders of record on
the first day of our fiscal year.

 

Our common
stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, and we do not
intend to register our common stock under the Exchange Act on a
pre-effective basis (provided that, we will register our common
stock under the Exchange Act if we have, after the last day of our
fiscal year, more than 500 shareholders of record, in accordance
with Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act). As long as our common
stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, we will not be
subject to Section 14 of the Exchange Act, which, among other
things, prohibits companies that have securities registered under
the Exchange Act from soliciting proxies or consents from
shareholders without furnishing to shareholders and filing with the
SEC a proxy statement and form of proxy complying with the proxy
rules. In addition, so long as our common stock is not registered
under the Exchange Act, our director and executive officer and
beneficial holders of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock
will not be subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act requires executive officers and
directors, and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a
registered class of equity securities to file with the SEC initial
statements of beneficial ownership, reports of changes in ownership
and annual reports concerning their ownership of common shares and
other equity securities, on Forms 3, 4 and 5 respectively. Such
information about our directors, executive officers, and beneficial
holders will only be available through periodic reports and any
registration statements on Form S-1 we file. Furthermore, so long
as our common stock is not registered under the Exchange Act, our
obligation to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act
will be automatically suspended if, on the first day of any fiscal
year (other than a fiscal year in which a registration statement
under the Securities Act has gone effective), we have a fewer than
300 shareholders of record. This suspension is automatic and does
not require any filing with the SEC. In such an event, we may cease
providing periodic reports and current or periodic information,
including operational and financial information, may not be
available with respect to our results of operations.

Market For
Common Equity

 

No public
market currently exists for shares of our common stock. We intend
to contact a market maker to file an application on our behalf to
have our common stock listed for quotation on the Over-the-Counter
Bulletin Board. Of the 5,250,000 shares of common stock
outstanding as of June 30, 2016, 5,250,000 shares are owned by Mr.
Revivo and may only be resold in compliance with Rule 144 of the
Securities Act of 1933. As of the date of this Prospectus, we have
one (1) stockholder. We have no outstanding shares of common stock
or any other securities to which we have granted registration
rights.

 

Dividend
Policy

 

The
Company does not anticipate paying dividends on the Common Stock at
any time in the foreseeable future. The Company’s Board of
Directors currently plans to retain earnings for the development
and expansion of the Company’s business. Any future
determination as to the payment of dividends will be at the
discretion of the Board of Directors of the Company and will depend
on a number of factors including future earnings, capital
requirements, financial conditions and such other factors as the
Board of Directors may deem relevant.

 

Rule 144
Shares

 

All of the
presently outstanding shares of common stock are “restricted
securities” as defined under Rule 144 promulgated under the
Securities Act and may only be sold pursuant to an effective
registration statement or an exemption from registration, if
available. Rule 144, as amended, is an exemption that generally
provides that a person who has satisfied a six month holding period
for such restricted securities may sell, within any three month
period, provided the Company is current in its reporting
obligations under the Exchange Act, and subject to certain manner
of resale provisions, an amount of restricted securities which does
not exceed the greater of 1% of a company’s outstanding
common stock or the average weekly trading volume in such
securities during the four calendar weeks prior to such sale. Ou
sole officer and director owns 5,250,000 restricted shares, or 100%
of the outstanding common stock. When these shares become available
for resale, the sale of these shares by these individuals, whether
pursuant to Rule 144 or otherwise, may have an immediate negative
effect upon the price of the Company’s common stock in any
market that might develop.

 

Rule 144
is not available for either a reporting or non-reporting shell
company unless the company: (1) has ceased to be a shell company;
(2) is subject to the Exchange Act reporting obligations; (3) has
filed all required Exchange Act reports during the preceding twelve
months; and (4) at least one year has elapsed from the time the
company filed with the SEC, current Form 10 type information
reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell
company.

 

As of the
date of this Prospectus, no shares of our common stock are
available for sale under Rule 144.

Reports

 

Following
the effective date of this Registration Statement we will be
subject to certain reporting requirements and will furnish annual
financial reports to our stockholders, certified by our independent
accountants, and will furnish un-audited quarterly financial
reports in our quarterly reports filed electronically with the SEC.
All reports and information filed by us can be found at the SEC

limited.

 

Under
Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, we are not required to file
periodic reports if we have less than 300 holders of record for the
fiscal year after the year this registration statement becomes
effective. Additionally, we will not be subject to the
Commission’s proxy, tender offer, and short swing insider
trading rules for Section 12 registration and we may not have an
ongoing periodic reporting obligation, depending on our number of
shareholders.

This

statements that reflect our current views regarding the future
events and financial performance of Wigi4You

 

Overview

 

We qualify
as an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act. As
a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions
from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an
emerging growth company, we will not be required to:

 




 



•



have an
auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting
pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;




 

 




 



10



 




  

 

 




 



•



comply
with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation
or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an
auditor discussion and analysis);




 




 



•



submit
certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory
votes, such as “say-on-pay” and
“say-on-frequency;” and




 

 




 



•



disclose
certain executive compensation related items such as the
correlation between executive compensation and performance and
comparisons of the CEO’s compensation to median employee
compensation.




 

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an
emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended
transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities
Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In
other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
