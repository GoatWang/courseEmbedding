George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

10 Barrel Series - one-off beers inspired by anything and everything.


Inspiration:
First brewed as an Experimental Series beer, this Saison is light, refreshing and moreish. Generous amounts of Lemon Drop hops provide a citrusy counterpoint to a spicy Saison yeast strain, backed up by some Czech Sladek hops for added complexity. This version is dry hopped to give it an extra citrusy kick.

LAST FEW KEGS REDUCED TO CLEAR
10 Barrel Series - one-off beers inspired by anything and everything.


Inspiration:
Inspiration:  Pumpkins.  Autumn.  Pumpkin Pie.  We first brewed this seasonal spiced beer (Pumpkin Piebald from the Experimental Series) in October 2015 and loved it.  This is our 10 Barrel Series version… this year we roasted the first pumpkins of the season overnight in The Welsh Oven’s massive pizza oven and added them to the mash.  Cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice were added to this malty amber ale serving up ‘thanksgiving in a glass’.

The Democrats’ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party’s commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

10 Barrel Series - one-off beers inspired by anything and everything.


Inspiration:
Inspiration:   Lager.  Lager.  Lager.  We wanted to brew a lager… a proper lager… definitely not a light, flavourless lager that the big industrialised brewers have tried to brainwash us with over the last 60 years or so.   Vienna Lager is a style that we love and one that is now nearly extinct in its area of origin.  This is our version… think amber, malty and full-flavoured with a dry and crisp finish… this is what lagers can and should be!
