Regulation G Statement


This web page includes financial results and guidance for NiSource Inc. with respect to net operating earnings and operating earnings, which are non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC’s Regulation G. NiSource Inc. includes such measures because management believes they permit investors to view NiSource Inc.'s performance using the same tools that management uses and to better evaluate NiSource Inc.'s ongoing business performance. With respect to such guidance, it should be noted that there will likely be differences between such measures and GAAP equivalents due to various factors, including, but not limited to, fluctuations in weather, asset sales and impairments, and other items included in GAAP results. NiSource Inc. is not able to estimate the impact of such factors on GAAP earnings and, as such, is not providing earnings guidance on a GAAP basis. 


Forward-Looking Statements 


This web page contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws. Investors and prospective investors should understand that many factors govern whether any forward-looking statement contained herein will be or can be realized. Any one of those factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected.
