Need Help With Your Invention or Product Idea?
If you are an inventor with a patent or just someone who has one great idea for a new invention, we can help you make it very profitable.
We are licensing agents in search of great inventions, both with patents and without patents, to bring to market by way of a licensing agreement.
Simply put, we find companies who will manufacture and distribute your invention and give you a generous royalty percentage of sales.
Let Us Pay For It!
Besides a nominal small fee to evaluate your invention, which only serves to weed out those that are simply curious, we are only compensated when we license a deal for you.
Depending on how developed your invention is at the time you submit it, our services of marketing and licensing for your invention or patent can range but may include:
Invention Marketing and Licensing Services



•  Patent assistance
•  Market research
•  Prototype development
•  Engineered drawings
•  Computer renderings
•  Manufacturing feasibility
•  Invention marketing material creation
•  Networking with potential licensees
•  Trade show representation
•  Invention presentation
•  Licensing negotiation
•  License agreement administration



So, if your invention is great like you say it is, and we choose to represent you, all other costs for seeking a license deal will be paid by us!
There are no hidden charges, no large up-front fees, just a no-risk-high-reward offer that we are making to those with great inventions!

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

Successful Inventions
Below are just some of the products that we have successfully licensed or commercialized on behalf of our clients. This sampling of products highlights some of the many industries that we work in.


 



Featured Licensed Product
 
 
 


Instant Trainer
L&L Licenses Pet Invention to As Seen on TV Marketer
Invented by Terry Silva 
The story of Terry Silva’s invention had a painful beginning.  After being dragged across the street, causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room, Terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her  110 pound German Shepherd-Alaskan Husky, named Ziggy.
“I went to the Dollar Store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen,” said Silva.  “I was pleasantly surprised when it worked, so I had a sturdier one made that my dog Ziggy loved!  He walked by my side and I never had to put any pressure on the new leash.” Like most inventors who develop their invention, Terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option.
That’s when she reached out to Lambert & Lambert to help her design and market her new invention, make presentations, and negotiate the license deal.  “Working with Lambert & Lambert has been a pleasure.  They are true professionals and I couldn’t have done it without them.”

What is the Skin Barrier?
Skin has a barrier which acts as the body’s first line of defense against external aggressors. It also helps retain essential moisture. Constant exposure to elements such as UV rays, pollution & stress can weaken the skin barrier.











Replenish Moisture
Keeping skin hydrated is key for healthy looking skin. Ingredients such as Glycerin and water can replenish moisture. La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water has a unique combination of minerals & trace elements to soothe & hydrate skin.











Help Restore the Skin Barrier
Ceramides are a key component of skin. They help to make up the skin barrier and lock in moisture. Ceramides are naturally lost, which can contribute to dry skin. Replenishing these essential lipids is important for maintaining a strong skin barrier.

He also served in various leadership, engineering and production roles for Bombardier and Aquilon Technologies, a manufacturer of attachments for farm equipment OEMs. Mr. Lambert also currently serves on the boards of three private companies and has previously served on the boards of other private companies. Mr. Lambert graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal with a B.Eng. in mechanical/aeronautical engineering and a graduate business degree from the Universite Laval. We believe Mr. Lambert's substantial industry experience, his leadership positions in diverse manufacturing businesses and his vast knowledge of operational matters in the recreational products and powerboat industries, enable him to play a key role in all matters involving our Board of Directors and make him well qualified to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.

of 17resultsMap ViewSponsoredDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glassDid You Know?There has perhaps never been a better tool for do-it-yourself home handymen than the internet. With detailed instructions and videos explaining how to perform a number of common maintenance and renovation tasks around a house, an untrained homeowner might be surprised at how much he or she can accomplish with a quick search online. But even with all of this information, there are still many jobs that lie far outside the scope of most DIY enthusiasts. General contractors are there to fill in this gap.A general contractor specializes in seeing a home remodel or repair project through from start to finish. To do this, the contractor works with the client - whether they are a homeowner or business - to nail down the scope of the work. Then he or she will turn to one or more subcontractors for specific tasks, like equipment operation, design, electrical work or whatever else is needed.In essence, general contractors could be thought of as middlemen between a homeowner or business owner and any number of specialists. To get their money's worth, many assume they should just "cut out the middleman" and hire specialists directly, but this often proves more difficult in practice. General contractors won't be completing an entire project by themselves, but should have a long list of dependable experts who can work together and accomplish any task. They might also serve as the manager on the site of a construction project, overseeing workers and providing guidance and assistance when needed. For larger projects, though, the contractor might only handle administrative matters and employ a foreman or other professional for on-site supervision.Common JobsThere are many general contractors who also specialize in certain tasks themselves. There is usually at least one general contractor on hand to organize the construction of an entire home, for example. But general contractors could also help a homeowner add an additional bedroom, build an in-ground pool or complete a major landscaping project. They could also work with a business to add or improve office space, whether that means making more room or converting a commercial building from a nail salon to a restaurant. Basically, if it's a job that involves building or repairing, a general contractor probably knows how to get it done.No matter what the exact job may be, a contractor will probably need to accomplish several other essential tasks in pursuit of the ultimate goal, which may include:Understanding and applying for building permits to meet local regulationsOrganizing a budget and adhering to it throughout the projectGathering all the necessary tools and equipment, from hammers and shovels to large excavators and generatorsSecuring the construction site and equipment after work hoursWorking with personnel on-site to address any issuesKeeping records of materials, labor and all other expensesLicensingEvery general contractor performing any kind of work on a project must be licensed to do so in their state. The guidelines for the specifics on licensing vary from state to state. Some states might only require registration of contractors, which is different from licensing. Registration typically means that there must be a written record of what work is being performed and by whom, but it does not guarantee professional knowledge. Licensing, on the other hand, involves an examination process to assess professional competence.Whether your state requires licensing or registration of contractors, there should be a record of most professionals willing to complete certain projects in your area. Check your state or county website for more information. In states that require licensing, every licensed contractor's contact information is available online or from another public source.Not every project needs to be completed by a licensed or registered contractor. If it's just a minor job that won't take more than a day or two, and will cost less than a few hundred dollars, it's likely not necessary to find a licensed or registered contractor. However, anything bigger or more expensive, or a project involving plumbing or electrical work, needs to be completed by a licensed or registered professional.General contractors also must be covered by an insurance policy. This should include liability coverage for any property damage that could be inflicted in the course of a job. It should also include a worker's compensation policy in case anyone is injured on the job. Before hiring a contractor for anything, ask for written proof of this insurance to see exactly what is covered. Trade AssociationsA number of trade associations for contractors in the U.S. exist. Some of the biggest include:Associated General Contractors of America: Represents more than 6,500 general contracting firms and more than 9,000 specialty contractors nationwide.Associated Builders and Contractors: Represents non-union contracting firms.Most trade associations for general contractors will provide references for anyone looking to hire a contractor for a specific project. They may also provide a number of benefits for their members, including assistance with licensing, training, insurance and business development.Hiring a General ContractorNo matter what you need accomplished, you want to choose a contractor who can get the job done right at a reasonable price. Obviously, this is easier said than done, but there are a few steps you can take to ensure you find a trustworthy general contractor.Finding general contractorsThe first, and perhaps most reliable, way to find a general contractor is to ask friends and family members for a recommendation. If you know anyone who has had major work done on their home, particularly if it's a similar job, ask them who they hired and if they were pleased with the result. You could also ask neighbors about who they've hired if you notice work being done on their house. Many remodeling contractors post signs in front of homes to advertise their services. As a general rule, it's rarely a good idea to hire a contractor who solicits work by going door to door.If you are considering hiring a contractor without a personal recommendation, ask the contractor for references from past clients, and do as much background research on them as possible. Look for any complaints (or compliments) online to get a better idea of their track record. There are a number of websites specializing in connecting contractors with people or businesses who need work done. These sites may also allow past clients to submit their own reviews of the contractor. BudgetBefore hiring a contractor, make sure you are both in agreement on the project's budget. It's normal for most contractors to charge clients a premium not only for the labor expenses and zoning expertise, but for acquiring the materials as well. Be as clear and concise as possible regarding what you'll be purchasing yourself and what you will be paying the contractor to complete. Homeowners may be able to find a better deal on raw materials when they purchase these directly, but they first need to be sure they aren't buying the wrong things.Don't forget to discuss how the project will be finalized and what will be done about cleanup. Plans for how the work site will be cleaned at the end of each day as well as at the conclusion of work need to be put in writing. An experienced general contractor should make every effort to keep the workspace clean and prevent dirtying or damaging any other area. Even so, talk with the contractor about the daily schedule, the logistics of transporting workers and equipment, and how cleanup will be handled.Prioritizing SafetyAs previously mentioned, you need to make sure to follow any state and local regulations regarding construction work, which includes hiring a licensed or registered general contractor. Ask the contractor for proof of their certification before signing anything, as well as their proof of insurance. You should also check your homeowners insurance policy to see if they offer coverage for contracted work. You may want to call your insurance provider and ask for more details on what your plan will and won't cover.Perhaps the best way to feel safe about a contractor and the work being done is to hire a contractor you trust. This is why relying on personal references from friends and family is so important, and will often provide a great deal of peace of mind. If you aren't able to obtain a reference, work to conduct extensive research on the contractor as well as the work you are hiring them to perform. This should bring everyone's expectations into alignment and result in a safe work environment.Financial safetyBefore any money changes hands, there should be a contract to sign. Make sure the specifics of the work to be done and all costs are listed in the contract, right down to the most precise details. If you forget to have something included in the contract after signing it, there's rarely a chance of recourse. Once the specifics of the job are nailed down, be sure to discuss the payment schedule with the contractor. This is important because paying too much up front offers the homeowner minimal leverage if the quality of work does not meet expectations or contractual specifications. Try to establish a reasonable pay schedule with the contractor, such as paying 10 percent of the total cost for each 10 percent of the work that is completed. It's a good idea to include this payment plan in the contract as well.Finally, look into getting a lien release signed before work begins. If there is ever a dispute regarding payment over the course of the project, a contractor or subcontractor could place a payment claim, or lien, on your property. This can trigger a long legal process that may be frustrating. To avoid this, ask the contractor to sign a lien release, which is a legal agreement that states that any payment accepted is final. This can come in handy if a contractor has his or her own payment issues with their subcontractors. Signing a lien release form certifies that any payment made by a client to the contractor is enough to pay for any goods or services rendered. A lien dispute could also be prevented by performing due diligence prior to picking a contractor, as any contractor with good credit and a long track record of satisfied clients should have no trouble paying for materials and labor once all contract conditions have been met.Once work is underway, it's never a bad idea to check up on the progress of the job, either by staying in touch with the contractor over the phone or visiting the site in person. If you work with a trustworthy professional, it's probably best to keep your distance and allow everyone to stay busy. If you want to keep an eye on things, make sure workers wear the right safety gear and that everything looks to be moving along according to schedule. Finally, once work is finished and you are satisfied, be sure to thank your contractor and tell friends or family members about your experience.

Who We Are
Lambert & Lambert is an innovative group of specialists dedicated to licensing our clients’ inventions.  We employ attorneys, engineers, and those with expertise in market research, marketing and promotion, video production, drafting, CAD, industrial design, prototyping, and manufacturing.
Our one goal is that our clients and their invention achieve success.  This is because we have a vested interest in them of our time and resources and only get paid when they do.
To us, success means that the inventor receives royalty checks from manufacturers that far exceeds his or her initial investment.  And maybe even more importantly to some, that they get the pleasure of contributing to society and seeing their invention on the shelves of their local stores.  To do this we employ all of our talents and connections to tailor a plan specifically for our clients’ inventions.
Lambert & Lambert is also a proud member of the Better Business Bureau, the MN Inventors Congress, Professional Member of the United Inventors Association, Licensing Executives Society and has been recognized by the National Inventor Fraud Center as “Official Good Guys”.
 
 
 


 

 

 

 
 
 



Who We Are NOT
We are NOT an invention marketing company who accepts every invention, promises high returns for large up-front fees, and then only sends out an unsolicited mailer advertising the invention.
These fraudulent companies give the few honest ones a very bad name.  Their main (if not only) stream of income is in charging huge sums of money to the inventors of whom they are representing. The way they work is by offering the inventor a marketability analysis that touts of high returns if only the inventor moves to the next step which costs upwards of $10,000-$15,000.
The inventor gets a second mortgage on his or her home and nothing comes of it.  It is very sad to hear of these good-intentioned inventors who were ripped-off by these companies.  So, beware and be sure to ask important questions regarding their business and how they operate.

Successful Inventions
Below are just some of the products that we have successfully licensed or commercialized on behalf of our clients. This sampling of products highlights some of the many industries that we work in.


 



Featured Licensed Product
 
 
 


Instant Trainer
L&L Licenses Pet Invention to As Seen on TV Marketer
Invented by Terry Silva 
The story of Terry Silva’s invention had a painful beginning.  After being dragged across the street, causing cuts and bruises that sent her to the emergency room, Terry knew she needed a new solution to help control her  110 pound German Shepherd-Alaskan Husky, named Ziggy.
“I went to the Dollar Store and purchased a bunch of dog collars and linked them together over his spine and around his abdomen,” said Silva.  “I was pleasantly surprised when it worked, so I had a sturdier one made that my dog Ziggy loved!  He walked by my side and I never had to put any pressure on the new leash.” Like most inventors who develop their invention, Terry determined that licensing it to a company with connections at retail would be the best option.
That’s when she reached out to Lambert & Lambert to help her design and market her new invention, make presentations, and negotiate the license deal.  “Working with Lambert & Lambert has been a pleasure.  They are true professionals and I couldn’t have done it without them.”

What is the Skin Barrier?
Skin has a barrier which acts as the body’s first line of defense against external aggressors. It also helps retain essential moisture. Constant exposure to elements such as UV rays, pollution & stress can weaken the skin barrier.











Replenish Moisture
Keeping skin hydrated is key for healthy looking skin. Ingredients such as Glycerin and water can replenish moisture. La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water has a unique combination of minerals & trace elements to soothe & hydrate skin.











Help Restore the Skin Barrier
Ceramides are a key component of skin. They help to make up the skin barrier and lock in moisture. Ceramides are naturally lost, which can contribute to dry skin. Replenishing these essential lipids is important for maintaining a strong skin barrier.




















NEW Toleriane Daily Moisturizers and Cleansers!

Introducing a new generation of cleansers and moisturizers that work together to help restore healthy looking skin. These gentle formulas replenish moisture and help restore skin’s natural protective barrier.
The new Toleriane products are formulated with La Roche-Posay Prebiotic Thermal Water, lipid-replenishing Ceramide-3, soothing Niacinamide, and moisturizing Glycerin.
Developed under a stringent formulation charter: oil free, non comedogenic, fragrance free, paraben free, soap and sulfate-free cleansers, allergy tested, dermatologist tested, and suitable for sensitive skin.
