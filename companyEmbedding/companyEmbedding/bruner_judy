To accompany ssjm1204satchat, by Steve Johnson.Show Caption of ExpandBy Steve Johnson | Mercury News, Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: December 16, 2010 at 3:32 am | UPDATED: August 13, 2016 at 7:09 pmFounded in 1988, Milpitas chipmaker SanDisk has become a leading seller of removable data-storage cards, universal serial bus drives and other flash memory products for a wide array of electronics.
Able to record information in compact formats, the company’s products are used in everything from mobile phones and digital cameras to video games and laptop computers. 
Over the past decade, its annual revenue has surged from $247 million in 1999 to nearly $3.6 billion last year. Despite a few dips into the red over the past decade, it has been mostly profitable. This year, it’s on a record-earnings pace that should easily double the $415 million in net income it reported in 2009.
Perhaps no one pays more attention to that bottom line than 52-year-old Judy Bruner, SanDisk’s chief financial officer. A longtime valley veteran with three decades of financial-management experience, she discussed her company and its rising fortunes in a recent interview, which has been edited for length and clarity. 
Q Given the still sluggish economy, SanDisk has done quite well. Why?
A 2010 has been really a stellar year. Consumer demand is not yet back to what it was before the 2008 downturn, but consumers are buying and I think our products are attractive to them in two ways. One is that our flash memory solutions are going into devices that are hot today, like smartphones and tablets. And our products are relatively inexpensive. So a consumer is still going to buy a memory card for their phone or their camera even if they might not go buy a television set or a car. 
Q You had announced some job cuts last year. Are you adding employees now?
A I would say we are prudently hiring, really, in all major regions in which we operate.
Q Does that include the Bay Area?


A Yes.
 Q You have about 3,500 employees worldwide, with about 1,250 in Milpitas. As your company evolves, do you expect to maintain a significant Silicon Valley presence?
A Oh yeah, this is our corporate headquarters. We feel we want to be in all the locations where we can get the best talent, primarily engineering talent, and there continues to be a significant presence of engineering talent here.
Q You mentioned your company’s interest in the fast-growing tablet market. What makes your flash memory products useful for those types of gadgets.
A There’s quite a bit of demand for higher-capacity flash memory in tablets, and the interesting thing about tablets is that no other storage medium really works with them. Flash is uniquely suited to a tablet because it has low-battery consumption and it’s very thin. You can’t make a device as thin as a tablet with a rotating disc drive. Flash also is fast, with instant-on capability, and it is rugged. If you’re carrying a tablet around and drop it, you don’t want to lose the data.
Q You sell most of your memory devices to companies that build them into the computers or other gadgets they make. But you also sell directly to consumers through retail outlets. Why is the retail market important?
A We have our products in nearly a quarter-million storefronts around the world. And that helps strengthen the brand recognition because customers see our products in so many different sections of the stores. They see them in the mobile-phone section, in the digital imaging section, in the USB drive section, in the audio-video section.
Q SanDisk and Toshiba for years have had joint manufacturing ventures and in July announced a deal to jointly build a state-of-the-art memory product manufacturing plant in Yokkaichi, Japan. You also develop some products together. Can you talk about that relationship?
A We have now been in partnership with Toshiba for 10 years. I would tell you it’s been one of the key areas of success for us. I think it would be hard to find another example of joint ventures between a U.S. company and an international company that have been as successful as ours with Toshiba. 
Q Women still hold relatively few top jobs in Silicon Valley. Any thoughts about that?
A I have to say I have never felt there was anything holding me back in my career. So I think technology in particular is a great area for women or for anyone to succeed. It really comes down to your talent and your persistence and your drive to succeed.
