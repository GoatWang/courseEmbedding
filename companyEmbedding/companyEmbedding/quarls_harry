Month: December 2007 


Four Stages of Market Maturity 

You can tell the maturity of a market by the consumer patterns.  If you know the life cycle stages of a market you can better anticipate what level of “needs” your product needs to match to be successful.  (I always think of needs in stages like Maslow’s hierarchy.) The Four Stages of Market Maturity Stage…






Love Your Dogs 

I read an interesting article on behavioral economics by Harry Quarls, Thomas Pernsteine, and Kasturi Rangan, in “strategy+business” magazine.  According to the authors, behavioral finance supports a counter-intuitive strategy of loving your market “dogs” (underperformers) over your stars.  They pose a few questions up front:  What if conventional wisdom is wrong? What if corporations would be…






Kano, Satisfiers, and Dissatisfiers 

If you’re looking for yet another way to help you prioritize your backlog or to help you shape your product’s design, consider the Kano model. One concept in the Kano model is satisfiers and dissatisfiers.  You can think of satisfiers as features you might ask for.  You can think of a dissatisfier as an unmet need. …






Rituals for Results 

Routines help build efficiency and effectiveness.  Consistent action over time is the key to real results.  If you add continuous improvement or Kaizen to the picture, you have an unbeatable recipe for success.  The following are some of my rituals for results:  Put in your hours.  I heard that Hemingway wrote for two hours a…






Forcing Functions 

Do you have a favorite set of forcing functions?  In patterns & practices, one of our forcing functions is building a slide deck.  Building a deck is a forcing function because it forces us to distill the points, close down on issues, identify what we know, don’t know and need to know next in a fairly…






Kaizen 

Kaizen is a Japanese term for continuous improvement.  A little Kaizen goes a long way over time.  From a personal development standoint, it’s key for overcoming resistance.






Building Books in patterns and practices 

Book building is art and science. I’ve built a few books over the years at patterns & practices. In this post, I’ll share a behind the scenes look at what it takes to do so. I’ll save the project management piece for another day, and focus on the core of book building.  Book ExamplesBefore we…






CodePlex, GE, and MSDN 

One of the questions I get is how we build and publish our guides and what’s the relationship of CodePlex, GE and MSDN.  At a high-level, we build reusable guidance nuggets for customer questions and tasks.  We then build a larger guide to bring the nuggets together into a story. Together, this gives us both…






SDL for Apps and Verticals 

What’s one path the SDL (Security Development Life Cycle) can take to amplify impact?  From my perspective, I think the key is specialization for app types and verticals.  I base this on lessons learned from  shaping prescriptive guidance over the years, the market trend for specialization, and what I learned doing competitive assessments. I also…






Getting Started with Threat Modeling 

Threat Modeling is a way to identify potential security issues to help you shape your application’s security design.  If you need to create a threat model, and you aren’t sure how, here’s some links to get you started.  (Note that our patterns & practices threat modeling approach is adaptable for agile scenarios.  In fact, our…

Chairman of the Board

                    2016 - Current                  


Penn Virginia Corp.

                    PVA is an independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas in various domestic onshore regions including Texas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Pennsylvania.

Having completed our transformation to a “pure play” E&P company, we are now focusing our efforts on oil and NGL (natural gas liquids) investment opportunities rather than natural gas. During 2012, we grew our oil and NGL production to 48% (56% for the 4th quarter of 2012) of our total production, an increase compared to 28% during 2011.  These investments have yielded higher cash flows and margins that more than offset the decline in production volumes and realized prices from our natural gas production assets.  We expect our oil and NGL production to continue to grow as a percentage of our total production as we pursue higher rate-of-return projects in economically attractive oil and NGL-rich areas
