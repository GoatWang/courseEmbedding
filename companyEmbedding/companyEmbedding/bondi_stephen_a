Aqua and Bondi































Aqua and Bondi



Aqua and Bondi is a look back at Apple's recovery in the 1990s, the software it crafted into Mac OS X and the computer that made it all possible.









 







 The Bondi iMac — and the family of colorful computers that came after it — brought some much-needed clarity and excitement to the Mac line.More importantly, it bought Apple time to integrate NeXT's technology and build Mac OS X from the ashes of the aging Mac OS.This book looks at these parallel projects with a consideration of Apple's best product: the company itself.

      Description
    
The Bondi Blue iMac G3 — and the family of colorful computers that came after it — brought some much-needed clarity and excitement to the Mac line. It also bought Apple time to integrate NeXT's technology and build Mac OS X from the ashes of the aging Mac OS. This book is about those products, and how Apple pulled itself back on track after the disastrous years of the 1990s.

It's Great

    I love reading about Apple history. This book tells the story around the time of Mac OS X coming into existence and the birth of the iMac, as well as events surrounding that time. I thought I knew everything about those days at Apple already, but boy was I wrong. Stephen has such a wealth of knowledge and he conveys it so well in this book. And for only $3.99, there's really no reason not to get this book. Seriously,  get it now.
  



Delightful trip down translucent memory lane

    Really enjoyed this well-written, well-illustrated book. This era represents a really dramatic and fascinating time in Apple's history, and most people have forgotten this time by now.
  



Interesting, but not a lot there

    Maybe it's because I already knew a fair amount about Apple history, but I didn't find this book to provide a lot of detail. It was interesting to hear about the iMac and the evolution of Mac models. I found the discussion about Mac OS X and its origins in NeXTStep to be pretty light on detail. The book also seemed disjointed and hard to connect Bondi to Apple in the way the author suggests.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREThe Contemporary Blacksmithby Meilach, Dona Z./ Bondi, Stephen (Con)/ Meier, Daryl (Int)This important book tackles the burgeoning revival of the blacksmith's art. Author Dona Meilach has brought together over 500 works by nearly 200 artist-craftsmen from sixteen countries to illustrate the unprecedented activity in modern ironwork that has led to its blossoming into a serious art form. You will learn several techniques using hot and cold forming with the results clearly shown. You will be able to recognise how a fence, railing, grille, table, chair, knife, and other items evolve, and better appreciate their design and workmanship.  Each chapter provides background for the  type of objects shown-- architectural ironwork, sculpture, furniture, containers and vessels, lighting fixtures and candleholders, fireplace accessories, wind vanes, household and liturgical items, and the incredible knives made of Damascus steel. You will find ample information for how and where to begin your own study in this extensive resource list of organisations, Internet sources, publications, museums, and educational opportunities. This book undoubtedly should be found in the libraries of every metalworker, art educator, architect, interior designer, ironwares collector, and crafts person.Metal WorkCondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
