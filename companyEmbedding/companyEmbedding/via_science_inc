T.E.N.S. Units 
Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (T.E.N.S.) has the ability to treat chronic pain by way of overstimulating the periphary nerve system specifically in the affected area, or pain site. By delivering mild electrical pulses through the skin that stimulate the cutaneous and afferent nerves, T.E.N.S. masks chronic pain signals with a gentle tingling sensation.

E.M.S. Units
Electrical Muscle Stimulation (E.M.S.), or Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (N.M.E.S.) is the evocation of muscle contraction via electrical stimulation. The purpose of E.M.S. goes beyond just the provocation of nerves. E.M.S. may be used to increase blood circulation, reduce edema, strengthen muscles in immobilized patients or athletes, and subsequently test the function of said muscles in immobilized patients and athletes.

M.E.N.S. Units
Microcurrent Electrical Nerve Stimulation (M.E.N.S.) devices transmit electrical signals that are much weaker than that of T.E.N.S. and E.M.S.; these signals are much closer to currents utilized by cells within our bodies. By way of micro-amperage, M.E.N.S. is able to help expedite wound healing, production of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and reduction of swelling.

About Via Science










































 



















Via Science applies Big Math to solve high-value, complex business problems.





Via Science’s commercial headquarters is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts
and its advanced data science and engineering center is based in Montréal, Québec.
Using its microservices architecture, Focus™ (released in 2016), Via Science solves mission critical risk assessment, anomaly detection and causal analytics challenges in both the energy and security sectors.
Focus™ ingests, transforms and analyzes both streaming and batch data in faster, scalable and more efficient ways. The architecture allows Via Science to create small, independent modules that can handle
varying types and frequency of data as well as differences in operational deployment.
This modular approach means Via Science can offer customized solutions to each client.
At the core of Focus™ is REFS™, Via Science’s patented machine learning engine.
Based on Bayesian networks (new branch of mathematics), REFS™ excels at handling sparse and missing data:
a major problem in real world applications, such as with power grids or in cybersecurity.
Clients can access Via Science’s technology directly from the cloud, on-premise or
by leveraging our expert team of data scientists to create models on their behalf.
These models can run on commodity hardware or be integrated into client business intelligence tools
to analyze new data (e.g., streaming real-time data feeds of millions of events per minute) and discover:
When something will occur (predictions)
Why something will occur (causal explanations)
How to make more or less of something occur (simulations)




Via Science = Big ( Math + Computing + Data )

Sector Solutions at Via Science










































 



















Big problems need Big Math.
Growth of IP-connected objects (i.e., Internet of Things), proliferation of digital imagery (e.g., satellite and drone imagery) and advances in instrumentation (e.g., smart meters) are creating more data every year than data scientists can analyze in their lifetime.






This is where Big Math comes in.
Via Science’s AI / machine learning architecture, Focus™, handles everything from data ingestion to modeling to visualization, to help experts analyze high value risk assessment problems. At the core of Focus™ is Via Science’s patented, causal analytics engine that uses Bayesian networks to identify cause and effect relationships between variables quickly and automatically. Once these relationships are identified, we package them as a software model that can be:

Visualized and analyzed by experts to find the root cause of a problem or event
Queried for ‘what if’ simulations
Embedded in operations for predictions and alerts

Via Science licenses its software to customers to use on their own data and improve the productivity of their analytic and scientific staff. We provide risk assessment solutions in the following sectors:
