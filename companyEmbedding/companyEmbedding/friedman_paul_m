 Dermatologist Dr. Paul Friedman Gives Advice On How To Choose The Right Skin Care Product  
Published: 2011-06-02 by 
Ines Markovic in 
Skin Care 
 

 How many times did you find yourself in a drugstore or surfing the internet in search of a skin care product, and after buying and trying it, you realized that your skin doesn't like it? To avoid that from happening once again, read Dr. Paul Friedman's useful advices on how to pick the right skin care product.According to dermatologist Dr. Paul Friedman, “the skin care market is full of products that can help improve challenged skin, but many of my patients experience frustration with an oversaturated beauty market.” Here are some of the most common “beauty blunders” when it comes to buying and using consumer skin care products:- If you have acne-prone skin, avoid buying lotions that come in a jar or pot, says Dr. Friedman. Dipping your fingers into lotions every day introduces bacteria to the entire jar, and that can translate onto your skin, causing breakouts or infections.- Ask for recommendations, but proceed with caution. The old adage went, if you see a woman with great hair; ask where she had it done. The same can be applied to skin care – ask a friend what kind of moisturizer she likes and you might find your new favorite product, but keep in mind skin care is a unique experience: what works for some does not work for all.- If you are buying environmentally friendly products, watch out for those that are “paraben free.” Parabens have been singled out as potentially dangerous chemicals, but what most consumers don’t know is they are included in skincare items for a reason – to help them last longer. Most paraben-free products will spoil after a certain timeframe, which is usually listed on the package. Pay attention to this date and treat it almost like a food item, says Dr. Friedman.- You don’t need an “arsenal” of products to look your best. Many skin care companies sell their products in a series or grouping. According to Dr. Friedman, most women only need a gentle cleanser, daily moisturizer with SPF of 15 or higher, and a moisture-rich night cream to maintain a healthy complexion.- Read the (back of the) labels. Many products contain irritants like added fragrances or alcohols that can dry the skin. No matter what a package promises on the front, read the back carefully to ensure you are getting what’s advertised. If you have skin sensitivities towards certain foods, it is also important to look for essential oils, which are often derived from foods that can cause allergies in some people.- Don’t be fooled by clever marketing terminology. Product packaging is usually designed to do one thing: sell the product. Dr. Friedman says the last thing you should look for in a product is an appealing design. Be wary of claims like “dermatologist tested” or “allergy tested.” These phrases often carry little meaning.- Watch where you store your skin care. Different types of products, such as gels, may have temperature requirements in order to stay effective, notes Dr. Friedman. Leaving products in direct sunlight, in extreme heat or cold could also affect their performance. If there are no directions, Dr. Friedman notes products should be kept in cool, dry areas.And remember, the more you educate yourself, the better your chances are of finding a skin care routine that works for you. About Dr. Paul FriedmanPaul M. Friedman, M.D. is board-certified by the American Board of Dermatology, specializing in dermatologic laser surgery and Mohs micrographic surgery. He completed his residency in dermatology at the New York School of Medicine, one of the nation’s top dermatology residency programs. Dr. Friedman is the director of the DermSurgery Laser Center in Houston, Texas and also practices at the Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York in Manhattan.  He is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of Texas Medical School, Department of Dermatology, and a Clinical Assistant Professor of Dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College.

Acne scars or scars from injury or surgery  can all be made less prominent using lasers that will reduce the size and  redness of your facial scars.
Effective Scar Treatments

He is professional, honest, always spends time with me and is worth the wait.    Dr. Friedman always helps me look as young as I feel!15Houston, TX | Feb 13, 2017Treatment that did not help whatsoever. (Went to another doctor and first treatment helped right away, and paid 1/3 of his price). He will just do treatments just for the money. I honestly don't think he will tell you what you really need but what you don't need. Sigh please save your money and get second opinions from other offices.55-Karen H. in Fulshear, TX | Jul 26, 2016I am so pleased with Dr. Friedman.  i have used with with dermatology and cosmetic issues and he is so informative and detailed with everything.  I would also like to say that his assistant, Shanta, is absolutely awesome.  She can always answer any and all my questions pertaining to all procedures.  I truly recommend them!55-Jeryl Kyle in Houston, TX | May 15, 2016Highly recommend Dr.Friedman to anyone in need of cosmetic or medical treatment. He is trained extensively to be able to address any type of derma logical issue. As an author of numerous articles and books, Dr. Friedman is current with his approaches to his patients restore their health or reach their optimum appearance. His staff is also well trained and extremely courteous. I have the utmost confidence in Dr. Friedman's medical knowledge and surgical skill.55-H Wlkr in Houston, TX | Apr 15, 2016He is the best Dermatologist in Houston!!! 15-ES in Houston, TX | Apr 07, 2016I have never had such a terrible experience at a doctor's office. I came in to get help with scarring from years of teenage acne and was treated as though I were a dollar sign from the very start. When Dr. Friedman saw me he was very short, very insensitive and didn't seem to care the slightest bit about actually helping me. After he abruptly left the room, an assistant attempted to sell me thousands of dollars worth of clearly unnecessary products and bogus trearments.

Healthgrades also receives sanction and malpractice data throughout the year, depending on how frequently the state medical boards release updates. We remove a newly sanctioned doctor from the Recognized Doctor list as soon as we receive the information. However, it is important to note that malpractice information is publically available in only 14 states.Media & PublicationsDr. Friedman has no media or publications listed.Background Check 0 Malpractice ClaimsNo malpractice history found for Texas.What is medical malpracticeWhat is medical malpractice?Medical malpractice is issued when negligence by a doctor causes injury to a patient. For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

 The Appearance of fine lines on my thin lips caused my lipstick, to bleed into the lines
– Vanessa - Actual Patient

Do you see fine, thin lines all over your face, or deep lines between your eyebrows and around your mouth? Are the lines there all the time, or only during certain facial expressions? The answers to these questions will guide your treatment choices. Reducing lines and hollows will project the appearance of youth and health.
 
 


Almost eight years ago my dog, shasta attacked and bit me along the chin I needed two reconstructive surgeries.
– Kiana - Actual Patient

Scars and stretch marks are constant reminders of the past that can stand in the way of smooth, beautiful skin – but there is hope. Scar appearance can be improved by many therapies – from creams to dressings to injections. Laser therapy, a newer modality, has shown promising results in diminishing scar redness and appearance.

Nevus of Ota



What is Nevus of Ota?
Nevus of Ota, also known as congenital melanosis bulbi or oculodermal melaocytosis, is a skin condition affecting the upper third of the dermis. Five times more common in women than men, Nevus of Ota results in a benign blue or gray patch, or hyperpigmentation on the face, and may or may not involve a coloring of the eye. The skin condition can be congenital or acquired, and occurs when an increased number of melanocytes, or cells responsible for the skin’s pigmentation, are present in the upper layers of skin’s dermis.
Treatments for Nevus of Ota
Dr. Paul Friedman utilizes the latest laser procedures to treat Nevus of Ota. As with all consultations, when a patient is considering treatment for Nevus of Ota with Q-switched lasers, our dermatologists will look at your skin and discuss the desired results with you. At the Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center, Q-Switched Alexandrite and Q-Switched Nd:YAG are ideal treatment methods for Nevus of Ota, as well as birthmarks and tattoo removal. In some cases, the Fraxel re:store laser may also be used alone or in combination with the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser for further improvement of the Nevus of Ota.
During the procedure, an anesthetic cream is used to minimize discomfort as the area is treated with the laser(s). Patients may experience some redness, swelling, or crusting of the area, which should be resolved within a few days from the procedure. The laser is designed to treat skin with a darker pigmentation, while leaving lighter tissues unaffected. Following the treatment sessions, the darker pigment in the treatment areas will fade, with significant improvement shown after each session.
Schedule a Consultation for Nevus of Ota
For more information about the treatment of Nevus of Ota, or to schedule a consultation at the Dermatology and Laser Surgery Center, contact our practice today.

XTRAC® Laser Therapy



Psoriasis and vitiligo are common skin conditions that can surface all across your body and occur at any age. Both stemming from autoimmune irregularities, psoriasis produces red lesions on the skin covered by a buildup of white skin flakes, while vitiligo is characterized by multiple white patches resulting from a lack of skin pigmentation. XTRAC® Therapy from can help you diminish psoriasis outbreaks or control the lack of pigmentation associated with vitiligo using state-of-the-art laser technology at Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center.
Benefits of the XTRAC® Laser System
Treatment of psoriasis and vitiligo with the XTRAC® Laser system is FDA-approved and is known to consistently yield effective, sustained results for both children and adults. In comparison to other psoriasis and vitiligo treatments, XTRAC® Therapy is pain-free, covered by many insurance companies, and typically requires no application of topical skin care ointments. Additionally, the XTRAC® Laser system has not been shown to cause any harmful side effects such as liver damage, UV ray exposure, birth defects, or heart disease.
How does XTRAC® Laser Therapy work?
Our dermatologists use the XTRAC® Laser system to direct a UVB beam at the affected areas of your skin over the course of multiple treatment sessions, depending on your specific needs. The concentrated laser energy passes through a liquid light guide system that helps to rapidly clear your skin in a non-invasive manner. The technology enables the doctors to calibrate laser intensity to safely and effectively treat each targeted area. XTRAC® Therapy is painless and can generally be performed in 20 minutes or less, depending on the number of areas needed to be addressed.
Results from XTRAC® Therapy
Individual results may vary, although initial results can generally be expected to show after three to four treatments and gradually improve as sessions continue. Symptom relief typically lasts for an extended period of time and considerably longer than other popular treatment options.
Schedule Your Consultation
For more information on the treatment of psoriasis or vitiligo with the XTRAC® Laser system, contact Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center. Our staff will be happy to answer any of your questions or help you schedule a consultation with our doctor.

Smoothbeam™



Both severe and mild cases of acne can cause permanent scarring. But Paul M. Friedman, M.D. in Houston, Texas has an excellent method to treat acne scars in the office setting. Utilizing advanced technology and his extensive experience, Dr. Friedman is able to treat your acne and acne scarring.














What is Smoothbeam™ Laser, What Does it Treat?
*

One such  advance is the Smoothbeam™ laser, which is an effective, gentle and safe treatment option for troublesome acne.This treatment uses a laser to target overactive sebaceous (oil) glands in your skin. It is these glands that are the root cause of acne. Medical lasers like Smoothbeam™ have been used for over two decades to treat many other medical conditions, not just acne and acne scarring.















How it Works
Very mild side effects may include slight redness or swelling that lasts only a few hours to a few days. Of course, recovery and side effects vary from patient to  patient. Dr. Friedman and his team will explain what to expect during and after your Smoothbeam™ laser acne treatment at the time of your visit. In very rare cases, some patients experience a temporary pigmentation change in the treated area.














If you already have scars from acne when you were younger, the Smoothbeam™ can help you, also. Collagen, which is at the same depth in skin as your sebaceous glands and is made of mostly water, is also targeted by the Smoothbeam™ laser light. The very slight dermal injury caused by the laser light stimulates the production and deposition of new organized collagen beneath the skin resulting in significant improvement in the appearance of your acne scars.














To learn more about acne, acne scarring, and how they can be treated, please contact one of our doctors at the Dermatology & Laser Surgery Center today.  He has successful treated thousands of patients suffering with acne and acne scarring just like you.
