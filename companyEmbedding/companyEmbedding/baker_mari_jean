July 21, 2017Name that Scotch: Colorimetric recognition of aldehydes and ketones
Vodka tastes different from brandy, and connoisseurs can distinguish among different brands of whiskeys. The flavors of spirits result from a complex bouquet of volatile compounds. New colorimetric sensor arrays on disposable test-strips read by hand-held devices allow for their rapid, inexpensive, and sensitive identification by their chemical “fingerprints”. They are based on novel sensor arrays that detect and differentiate among a diverse range of aldehydes and ketones, as...

The GCS is the most common...


July 20, 2017Molting Feathers May Help Birds Deal with Environmental Contaminants
Mercury is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that affects the health of birds and other wild animals. Two varieties of songbird—zebra finch and European starling—were found to shed mercury accumulation with their feathers in a recent study.During a molt, both species quickly eliminated mercury from their blood and significantly reduced mercury concentrations in other tissues. This, coupled with a migration out of contaminated sites, may help birds deal with exposure to environmental...


July 20, 2017Cucumbers in Space Provide Insights on Root Growth
Scientists have untangled the competing influences of water and gravity on plant roots—by growing cucumbers during spaceflight.Plant roots grow to find water, according to a process known as hydrotropism. Roots are also influenced by gravity and tend to grow downwards, called gravitropism. To find out whether gravity or water had the greater influence on root growth, investigators grew cucumber plants in the microgravity environment on board the International Space Station. In their...
