Capital and Sponsorship for the Natural Resources Industry Since 1988



Founded in 1988, NGP has a family of private equity investment funds with approximately $17 billion of cumulative equity commitments organized to make direct equity investments in the energy sector.  NGP invests where there is a clear match between a management team’s growth strategy and NGP’s unique sponsorship capabilities.  NGP understands the dynamics of investing in a commodity business and works to support its portfolio companies as their growth strategy is executed.  
The strength of the firm lies in establishing relationships with “owner-managers” who see the mutual advantage of having an active sponsor, and then financing that management team.  NGP’s investments range from $10-$500 million.  
Since 1988, NGP has invested in over 300 transactions with over 190 companies throughout the energy sector and has been the catalyst for some of the largest recapitalizations and merger transactions in the industry.  We believe our consistent approach has become the standard for the energy-focused private equity industry.  NGP’s investment team offers a depth of experience supporting management teams to reach their goals while generating attractive returns for its investors.  

 














Tombstones are reflective of the NGP flagship funds.

NGP Energy Capital Management Announces $3.586 Billion Fund | Business Wire


























































NGP Energy Capital Management Announces $3.586 Billion Fund






July 11, 2012 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NGP Energy Capital Management (“NGP”) announced that the final closing 
      of NGP Natural Resources X, L.P. (“NGP X”) occurred on June 29, 2012 
      with total commitments of $3.586 billion. NGP X will continue NGP Energy 
      Capital Management’s 23-year history as a premier provider of private 
      capital and sponsorship to the natural resources industry, focusing on 
      the oil and gas production, oilfield services, and the energy mid-stream 
      sectors through its Natural Gas Partners investment platform and 
      focusing on the water resources & services and food & agriculture 
      sectors through its NGP Global Adaptation Partners investment platform. 
      NGP X will be managed by NGP, bringing the cumulative capital managed by 
      NGP and its affiliates since inception to a total of $13 billion.
    

      Kenneth A. Hersh, Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are extremely 
      thankful for the ongoing loyalty and support of our investor base and 
      appreciate the confidence placed in our team by both our existing 
      partners and new investors. We believe that their support is a testament 
      to our industry-leading investment returns generated over the past two 
      decades and the strong fundamentals in the natural resources investment 
      arena.”
    

      Mr. Hersh continued, “NGP X will invest in the same size deals that our 
      track record has been built upon. The fund was activated in January 2012 
      and already has 11 investments in its portfolio. Many of these 
      investments are managed by experienced management teams from prior NGP 
      portfolio companies. Given our current investment pace and strong deal 
      flow, we decided at the outset that fundraising efforts for NGP X would 
      be limited to a one-year period to optimize our focus on the investment 
      opportunities we are generating. We are very pleased with the amount of 
      capital raised during the past year, especially given the recession’s 
      impact on the overall fundraising market. NGP X is of sufficient size to 
      allow us to continue our core investment business over the next several 
      years.”
    

      In addition to Natural Gas Partners and NGP Global Adaptation Partners, 
      NGP’s investment platform also includes the NGP Energy Technology 
      Partners private equity funds which provide capital for growth and 
      buyouts in companies providing technology-related products and services 
      for the oil and gas, power and alternative energy sectors and includes 
      NGP Capital Resources Company (NASDAQ:“NGPC”), a publicly-traded 
      investment fund that focuses on providing debt and equity capital to the 
      natural resources and broader middle market industries.

Irving, Texas – February 27, 2014 – Natural Gas Partners, through its most recent fund, NGP Natural Resources X, L.P., and NGP Energy Technology Partners II, L.P. (collectively “NGP”) have made a $100 million equity commitment to MS Energy Services, LLC (“MS Energy” or the “Company”).  MS Energy is a leading independent, vertically-integrated directional drilling company with operations in most major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.  Denham Capital (“Denham”), the current majority owner of MS Energy, will maintain its ownership position in the Company going forward.
NGP’s growth equity investment will be used primarily to fund MS Energy’s organic growth opportunities, allowing the Company to further expand its current fleet of over 1,300 directional drilling motors, which have a long history of providing superior performance through the use of MS Energy’s proprietary technology and experienced personnel.  This investment gives MS Energy the ability to keep up with increasing demand resulting from the proliferation of horizontal drilling and increasing lateral lengths.  In addition to directional drilling motors, MS Energy will also expand its fleet of measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”) and survey equipment, offering its customers some of the latest, most advanced horizontal drilling technologies on the market today.
MS Energy is led by Allen Neel, an experienced oilfield services executive with a track record of creating value in the directional drilling business. Mr. Neel has a successful background developing and managing an array of oilfield services operations, including wireline, survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services.  Mr. Neel has been the Chief Executive Officer of MS Energy since August 2004.  Prior to serving in his current role, Mr. Neel held senior management positions at MS Energy’s predecessor, Warrior Energy Services (formerly Black Warrior Wireline Corp.).  Prior to Warrior Energy Services, Mr. Neel held management roles at Graves Well Drilling and Halliburton Services.
MS Energy is also led by Neel’s long-time partners Paul Culbreth (President and Chief Operating Officer) and Ron Whitter (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer). Prior to serving in his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Culbreth held various senior management and operations positions at Warrior Energy Services, Phoenix Drilling Services and Ocean Drilling and Exploration.  Mr. Culbreth was also a founder of Houston Directional Services.  Prior to serving in his current role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Whitter served as Chief Accounting Officer of Stewart & Stevenson LLC, Chief Financial Officer of Warrior Energy Services, and held other financial and accounting positions with Oil States Industries, Norfolk Energy and Transco Energy.“I am very excited to partner with NGP,” said Mr. Neel. “This investment allows us to continue meeting our customers’ directional drilling equipment and service needs, and also provides capital to further enhance our existing product lines while also developing new cutting-edge technologies to help our clients drill laterals longer, quicker, and with more precision than ever before.  With involvement from two leading energy-focused private equity firms in NGP and Denham, I am confident that we can continue growing the company to meet the industry’s ever-expanding needs.”
“NGP is extremely pleased to be partnering with MS Energy and Denham, as this investment represents numerous core tenets of NGP.  MS Energy is led by a cohesive, experienced management team with a track record of creating outsized returns in oilfield services, and the Company has multiple attractive uses of capital.  As the unconventional revolution continues to resemble a manufacturing operation, best-in-class service providers such as MS Energy will play a major role in E&P operators’ ability to drill wells on time and on budget.” said Kenneth A. Hersh, CEO of NGP Energy Capital Management.
About MS Energy Services, LLCWith over 20 years of experience in the industry, MS Energy is ranked as a leading independent directional drilling services company with an established presence in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.  As one of the most comprehensive oilfield service companies, MS Energy provides expertise in downhole electric wireline, directional survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services.

Natural Gas Partners has invested $100 million in MS Energy Services, a drilling company with operations in onshore oil and gas basins in the U.S. NGP made the investment from its NGP Natural Resources X and NGP Energy Technology Partners II. Denham Capital remains majority owner in the company.
Press Release
Natural Gas Partners, through its most recent fund, NGP Natural Resources X, L.P., and NGP Energy Technology Partners II, L.P. (collectively “NGP”) have made a $100 million equity commitment to MS Energy Services, LLC (“MS Energy” or the “Company”). MS Energy is a leading independent, vertically-integrated directional drilling company with operations in most major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. Denham Capital (“Denham”), the current majority owner of MS Energy, will maintain its ownership position in the Company going forward.
NGP’s growth equity investment will be used primarily to fund MS Energy’s organic growth opportunities, allowing the Company to further expand its current fleet of over 1,300 directional drilling motors, which have a long history of providing superior performance through the use of MS Energy’s proprietary technology and experienced personnel. This investment gives MS Energy the ability to keep up with increasing demand resulting from the proliferation of horizontal drilling and increasing lateral lengths. In addition to directional drilling motors, MS Energy will also expand its fleet of measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”) and survey equipment, offering its customers some of the latest, most advanced horizontal drilling technologies on the market today. 





MS Energy is led by Allen Neel, an experienced oilfield services executive with a track record of creating value in the directional drilling business. Mr. Neel has a successful background developing and managing an array of oilfield services operations, including wireline, survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services. Mr. Neel has been the Chief Executive Officer of MS Energy since August 2004. Prior to serving in his current role, Mr. Neel held senior management positions at MS Energy’s predecessor, Warrior Energy Services (formerly Black Warrior Wireline Corp.). Prior to Warrior Energy Services, Mr. Neel held management roles at Graves Well Drilling and Halliburton Services.
MS Energy is also led by Neel’s long-time partners Paul Culbreth (President and Chief Operating Officer) and Ron Whitter (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer). Prior to serving in his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Culbreth held various senior management and operations positions at Warrior Energy Services, Phoenix Drilling Services and Ocean Drilling and Exploration. Mr. Culbreth was also a founder of Houston Directional Services. Prior to serving in his current role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Whitter served as Chief Accounting Officer of Stewart & Stevenson LLC, Chief Financial Officer of Warrior Energy Services, and held other financial and accounting positions with Oil States Industries, Norfolk Energy and Transco Energy. 





“I am very excited to partner with NGP,” said Mr. Neel. “This investment allows us to continue meeting our customers’ directional drilling equipment and service needs, and also provides capital to further enhance our existing product lines while also developing new cutting-edge technologies to help our clients drill laterals longer, quicker, and with more precision than ever before. With involvement from two leading energy-focused private equity firms in NGP and Denham, I am confident that we can continue growing the company to meet the industry’s ever-expanding needs.”
“NGP is extremely pleased to be partnering with MS Energy and Denham, as this investment represents numerous core tenets of NGP. MS Energy is led by a cohesive, experienced management team with a track record of creating outsized returns in oilfield services, and the Company has multiple attractive uses of capital. As the unconventional revolution continues to resemble a manufacturing operation, best-in-class service providers such as MS Energy will play a major role in E&P operators’ ability to drill wells on time and on budget,” said Kenneth A. Hersh, CEO of NGP Energy Capital Management.
About MS Energy Services, LLC
With over 20 years of experience in the industry, MS Energy is ranked as a leading independent directional drilling services company with an established presence in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. As one of the most comprehensive oilfield service companies, MS Energy provides expertise in downhole electric wireline, directional survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services.

NGP Natural Resources XI, L.P. Key Developments

EnLink Midstream Partners, LP Forms Strategic Joint Venture with NGP Natural Resources XI LP to Expand Gathering, Processing Business in Core of Delaware Basin
Aug 1 16
A subsidiary of EnLink Midstream Partners, LP and EnLink Midstream, LLC and an affiliate of NGP Natural Resources XI, L.P. formed a strategic joint venture to operate and expand the Partnership's natural gas, natural gas liquids, and crude oil midstream assets in the liquids-rich Delaware Basin. The system expansion will provide leading midstream services to premier producer customers in the region. The new expansion, named Lobo II, will include the installation of a cryogenic natural gas processing facility with capacity up to 120 million cubic feet per day and associated natural gas and liquids gathering pipeline infrastructure in Loving County, Texas, and Eddy and Lea counties, New Mexico. The Partnership will serve as the joint venture's managing member and will handle day-to-day construction and operation of the assets, which are supported by long-term, fee-based commitments from major producers. The expansion builds off the Partnership's existing Lobo System, a gathering and processing system acquired from Matador Resources in October 2015, which the Partnership contributed to the newly formed joint venture. Upon completion of Lobo II, the facility will have a total processing capacity of approximately 155 MMcf/d in the Delaware Basin, which continues to be an active growth region for oil and gas production with superior economics. The joint venture is initially owned 50.1% by the Partnership and 49.9% by NGP. The Partnership contributed approximately $230 million of existing Delaware Basin assets to the joint venture and committed an additional approximately $285 million in capital to fund potential future development projects and potential acquisitions. NGP committed an aggregate of approximately $400 million of capital, including an initial contribution of approximately $115 million, which the joint venture distributed to the Partnership at the formation of the joint venture to reimburse the Partnership for capital spent to date on existing assets and ongoing projects. As part of this agreement, NGP granted the Partnership graded call rights beginning in 2021 to acquire increasing portions of NGP's interest in the joint venture at a price based upon a predetermined valuation methodology. The joint venture is governed by a board of directors initially comprised of two designees of each partner, with the Partnership serving as the joint venture's managing member that will handle day-to-day construction and operation of the assets.
