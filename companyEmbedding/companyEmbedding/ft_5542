They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO).

Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO).

Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer.

Ocala Real Estate Is Heating Up

                    If you have been thinking about upgrading to a larger home or a different neighborhood but have been putting it off until the real estate market improves then it may be time to bite the bullet. The bull market is back in Ocala, but who knows for how long. Low inventory of homes for sale coupled with increasing buyer demand has created a seller's market once again. Even new construction has resumed, a tell tale sign that prices are up. Don't be fooled though, the market is not back to its record highs, but prices are up and houses are selling within days of being listed and frequently with multiple offers. This is fantastic news for the Ocala real estate market and for your if you are thinking about selling your home. The first step is to contact a local realtor who can perform a comparative market analysis of your home's value so that you know what to expect going forward. Don't let the seller's market pass you by. Seize the opportunity to sell your home today.

Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.

They are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. These are also known as bank-owned or real estate owned (REO). Coming Soon Coming Soon listings are homes that will soon be on the market. The listing agent for these homes has added a Coming Soon note to alert buyers in advance. Learn more. Potential Listings Properties that may be coming to the market soon but are not yet found on a multiple listing service (MLS). They include pre-foreclosures, foreclosed homes and homes with a Make Me Move® price. Most of these properties are only found on Zillow. Foreclosed These properties are owned by a bank or a lender who took ownership through foreclosure proceedings. They may soon be listed for sale. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Pre-Foreclosure The lender initiated foreclosure proceedings on these properties because the owner(s) were in default on their loan obligations. Pre-foreclosures also include properties for which a foreclosure auction is scheduled. These properties are not found on a multiple listing service (MLS). Make Me Move Homes with a Make Me Move® price indicate the amount the owner(s) would be willing to sell for. They are exclusive to Zillow and a great way to learn about homes before they hit the market. For Rent  Recently Sold Open Houses only Include Pending listings A pending listing means a seller has accepted an offer from a buyer. In some cases, the seller will accept backup offers.
