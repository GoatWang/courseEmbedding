History[edit]
Founding and reincorporation[edit]
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. was originally incorporated in Germany as CEDC GmbH (Central European Development Corporation) in 1991. That same year[3] it changed its name and reincorporated in the Netherlands as Central European Media Enterprises (CME). Objections brought by the Czech Republic over the legal distinguishing of the two corporations were rejected by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as irrelevant.[3]
Second reincorporation[edit]
CEDC GmbH's capital interests were all transferred to CME on July the 28th, 1994.[5] CME moved its headquarters and reincorporated in Bermuda later that year.[4]
Operations[edit]
CME is the broadcast market leader in every country where it has television stations. It started broadcasting its first channel in the Czech Republic in 1994. CME operates 36 television channels broadcasting to approximately 50 million people across its six markets. CME develops and produces content for its television channels, and its content is also consumed through subscription- and advertising-based platforms.[6]
Key shareholders[edit]
On 23 March 2009, Time Warner announced that it would invest $241.5 million, for a 31% stake, in CME.[7]
Two years later on 3 March 2011, Time Warner bought another 3.1 million shares taking its stake in CME up to 34.4% with around 47 percent of voting rights and a total of 22.1 million shares.[8]
In July 2012 CME exercised its put option and Time Warner increased its economic interest in CME to 49.9%.[9]
During the second quarter of 2013, Time Warner maintained its 49.9% voting interest during a public offering of CME Class A Shares, and additionally purchased 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in a private placement.
During a rights offering and private placement in 2014, Time Warner increased its economic ownership on a diluted basis to approximately 75%.
International financier Raymond Staples through his global investment firm, TMP Holdings, Inc. was one of the early investors in CETV stock.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founding and reincorporation[edit]
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. was originally incorporated in Germany as CEDC GmbH (Central European Development Corporation) in 1991. That same year[3] it changed its name and reincorporated in the Netherlands as Central European Media Enterprises (CME). Objections brought by the Czech Republic over the legal distinguishing of the two corporations were rejected by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as irrelevant.[3]
Second reincorporation[edit]
CEDC GmbH's capital interests were all transferred to CME on July the 28th, 1994.[5] CME moved its headquarters and reincorporated in Bermuda later that year.[4]
Operations[edit]
CME is the broadcast market leader in every country where it has television stations. It started broadcasting its first channel in the Czech Republic in 1994. CME operates 36 television channels broadcasting to approximately 50 million people across its six markets. CME develops and produces content for its television channels, and its content is also consumed through subscription- and advertising-based platforms.[6]
Key shareholders[edit]
On 23 March 2009, Time Warner announced that it would invest $241.5 million, for a 31% stake, in CME.[7]
Two years later on 3 March 2011, Time Warner bought another 3.1 million shares taking its stake in CME up to 34.4% with around 47 percent of voting rights and a total of 22.1 million shares.[8]
In July 2012 CME exercised its put option and Time Warner increased its economic interest in CME to 49.9%.[9]
During the second quarter of 2013, Time Warner maintained its 49.9% voting interest during a public offering of CME Class A Shares, and additionally purchased 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in a private placement.
During a rights offering and private placement in 2014, Time Warner increased its economic ownership on a diluted basis to approximately 75%.
International financier Raymond Staples through his global investment firm, TMP Holdings, Inc. was one of the early investors in CETV stock.[citation needed]

SIX MONTHS- Net revenues increased 4% at actual rates and 7% at constant rates to US$ 316.9 million -- Operating income increased 22% at actual rates and 25% at constant rates to US$ 63.1 million -- OIBDA increased 18% at actual rates and 20% at constant rates to US$ 83.3 million -
HAMILTON, Bermuda, July  25, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. ("CME" or the "Company") (NASDAQ:CETV) (Prague Stock Exchange:CETV) today announced financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.
Operational and financial highlights:

TV advertising markets across our six countries increased an estimated 6% overall at constant rates in the first six months of 2017.
Our TV advertising revenues increased 2% at actual rates and 4% at constant rates in the first half of 2017, which reflected significant growth of demand in Romania, as well as higher levels of spending in the Czech Republic and Slovenia.
Carriage fees and subscription revenues increased 20% at actual rates and 23% at constant rates in the first half of 2017 due to additional carriage fees generated in Slovakia and Slovenia following our exit from DTT, as well as growth in subscribers in other markets.
Costs charged in arriving at OIBDA were broadly flat at actual rates and increased 1% and 3% at constant rates in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 as targeted investments in our programming line-up and higher bad debt charges were mostly offset by savings from transmission costs.
OIBDA increased 18% at actual rates and 20% at constant rates in the first half of 2017, resulting in OIBDA margin expansion of 300 basis points to 26% from 23% in the same period in 2016.
The increase in OIBDA improved operating income 22% at actual rates and 25% at constant rates in the first half of 2017.
Unlevered free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased 14%, reflecting higher cash collections, and net cash generated by continuing operating activities also included lower cash payments for interest and guarantee fees.
On July 9, 2017, we agreed to sell our operations in Croatia and Slovenia and plan to use proceeds of the sale, which is expected to close by year-end, to repay our 2018 term loan. This will significantly accelerate our plans to deleverage and reduce our current borrowing cost by 275 basis points to 4.5%, resulting in savings of more than US$ 30.0 million in annual interest costs in addition to US$ 30.0 million of savings from the March repricing transaction.

Michael Del Nin, Co-Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The first half of the year has been marked by important transactions and impressive financial performance, the combination of which positions us for a significant reduction in our leverage over the next 18 months. Following a successful sale of our operations in Croatia and Slovenia, we will have brought forward our deleveraging plans by a year and will be in a position to take full advantage of the automatic reductions in our borrowing costs. As a result, once we have achieved this, we should be able to pivot from our intense focus on debt reduction by 2019.  While this will increase the options we have for capital allocation, our decisions will, as always, be driven by our determination to create shareholder value."
Christoph Mainusch, Co-Chief Executive Officer, added: "The successful spring season contributed to prime time audience share increasing in five countries in the first half of 2017, while operating margins improved, as additional investments in content were mostly offset by other savings. These investments in programming in highly competitive markets also support our initiatives to diversify revenues, and carriage fees and subscription revenue grew significantly in the first half of the year.  We still expect carriage fees and subscription revenue from our four remaining operations going forward to increase double digits this year."
In this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow and constant currency percentage movements. Please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional information, including definitions and reconciliations to US GAAP financial measures.
Consolidated results for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016 were:

Segment Data
We manage our business on a geographical basis, with six reporting segments: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. These segments reflect how CME Ltd.'s operating performance is evaluated by our chief operating decision makers, who we have identified as our co-Chief Executive Officers, how operations are managed by segment managers, and the structure of our internal financial reporting.
We evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. Intersegment revenues and profits have been eliminated in consolidation.
Below are tables showing our net revenues and OIBDA by segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and June 30, 2016:

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this release we refer to several non-GAAP financial measures, including OIBDA, OIBDA margin, free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. We believe that each of these metrics is useful to investors for the reasons outlined below. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be evaluated in conjunction with, and are not a substitute for, US GAAP financial measures.
We evaluate our consolidated results and the performance of our segments based on net revenues and OIBDA. We believe OIBDA is useful to investors because it provides a meaningful representation of our performance, as it excludes certain items that do not impact either our cash flows or the operating results of our operations. OIBDA and unlevered free cash flow are also used as components in determining management bonuses.
OIBDA includes amortization and impairment of program rights and is calculated as operating income / loss before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and impairments of assets and certain unusual or infrequent items that are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating our performance. Stock-based compensation and certain other items are not allocated to our segments for purposes of evaluating their performance and therefore are not included in their respective OIBDA. Our key performance measure of the efficiency of our consolidated operations and our segments is OIBDA margin. We define OIBDA margin as the ratio of OIBDA to net revenues.
Following a refinancing transaction in March 2017, the amount of interest and related Guarantee Fees on our outstanding indebtedness that must be paid in cash has increased. In addition to this obligation to pay more interest and related Guarantee Fees in cash, we expect to use cash generated by the business to pay certain Guarantee Fees that are payable in kind. These cash payments are all reflected in free cash flow; accordingly we believe unlevered free cash flow, defined as free cash flow before cash payments for interest and Guarantee Fees, best illustrates the cash generated by our operations when comparing periods. We define free cash flow as net cash generated from continuing operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of disposals of property, plant and equipment and excluding the cash impact of certain unusual or infrequent items that are not included in costs charged in arriving at OIBDA because they are not considered by our co-Chief Executive Officers when evaluating performance.
For additional information regarding our business segments, see Item 1, Note 18, "Segment Data" in our Form 10-Q.
While our reporting currency is the dollar, our consolidated revenues and costs are divided across a range of European currencies and CME Ltd.'s function currency is the Euro. Given the significant movement of the currencies in the markets in which we operate against the dollar, we believe that it is useful to provide percentage movements based on actual percentage movements ("% Act"), which includes the effect of foreign exchange, as well as like-for-like percentage movements ("% Lfl"). The like-for-like percentage movement references reflect the impact of applying the current period average exchange rates to the prior period revenues and costs. Since the difference between like-for-like and actual percentage movements is solely the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates, our discussion in this release includes constant currency percentage movements in order to highlight those factors influencing operational performance. The incremental impact of foreign exchange rates is presented in the tables accompanying such analysis.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. (CME) is a Bermudan media and entertainment company operating in Central and Eastern Europe. A precursor to CME, Central European Development Corporation, was co-founded by Ronald Lauder and Mark Palmer in 1991.[2] It was incorporated as CME in the Netherlands in 1991 and reincorporated when it changed its headquarters to Bermuda in 1994.[3][4] The business is managed on a geographical basis, with six operating segments, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia, which are also the main operating countries. The company is listed on NASDAQ and Prague Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CETV.[1]

History[edit]
Founding and reincorporation[edit]
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. was originally incorporated in Germany as CEDC GmbH (Central European Development Corporation) in 1991. That same year[3] it changed its name and reincorporated in the Netherlands as Central European Media Enterprises (CME). Objections brought by the Czech Republic over the legal distinguishing of the two corporations were rejected by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as irrelevant.[3]
Second reincorporation[edit]
CEDC GmbH's capital interests were all transferred to CME on July the 28th, 1994.[5] CME moved its headquarters and reincorporated in Bermuda later that year.[4]
Operations[edit]
CME is the broadcast market leader in every country where it has television stations. It started broadcasting its first channel in the Czech Republic in 1994. CME operates 36 television channels broadcasting to approximately 50 million people across its six markets. CME develops and produces content for its television channels, and its content is also consumed through subscription- and advertising-based platforms.[6]
Key shareholders[edit]
On 23 March 2009, Time Warner announced that it would invest $241.5 million, for a 31% stake, in CME.[7]
Two years later on 3 March 2011, Time Warner bought another 3.1 million shares taking its stake in CME up to 34.4% with around 47 percent of voting rights and a total of 22.1 million shares.[8]
In July 2012 CME exercised its put option and Time Warner increased its economic interest in CME to 49.9%.[9]
During the second quarter of 2013, Time Warner maintained its 49.9% voting interest during a public offering of CME Class A Shares, and additionally purchased 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in a private placement.
During a rights offering and private placement in 2014, Time Warner increased its economic ownership on a diluted basis to approximately 75%.
International financier Raymond Staples through his global investment firm, TMP Holdings, Inc. was one of the early investors in CETV stock.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founding and reincorporation[edit]
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. was originally incorporated in Germany as CEDC GmbH (Central European Development Corporation) in 1991. That same year[3] it changed its name and reincorporated in the Netherlands as Central European Media Enterprises (CME). Objections brought by the Czech Republic over the legal distinguishing of the two corporations were rejected by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as irrelevant.[3]
Second reincorporation[edit]
CEDC GmbH's capital interests were all transferred to CME on July the 28th, 1994.[5] CME moved its headquarters and reincorporated in Bermuda later that year.[4]
Operations[edit]
CME is the broadcast market leader in every country where it has television stations. It started broadcasting its first channel in the Czech Republic in 1994. CME operates 36 television channels broadcasting to approximately 50 million people across its six markets. CME develops and produces content for its television channels, and its content is also consumed through subscription- and advertising-based platforms.[6]
Key shareholders[edit]
On 23 March 2009, Time Warner announced that it would invest $241.5 million, for a 31% stake, in CME.[7]
Two years later on 3 March 2011, Time Warner bought another 3.1 million shares taking its stake in CME up to 34.4% with around 47 percent of voting rights and a total of 22.1 million shares.[8]
In July 2012 CME exercised its put option and Time Warner increased its economic interest in CME to 49.9%.[9]
During the second quarter of 2013, Time Warner maintained its 49.9% voting interest during a public offering of CME Class A Shares, and additionally purchased 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in a private placement.
During a rights offering and private placement in 2014, Time Warner increased its economic ownership on a diluted basis to approximately 75%.
International financier Raymond Staples through his global investment firm, TMP Holdings, Inc. was one of the early investors in CETV stock.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Founding and reincorporation[edit]
Central European Media Enterprises Ltd. was originally incorporated in Germany as CEDC GmbH (Central European Development Corporation) in 1991. That same year[3] it changed its name and reincorporated in the Netherlands as Central European Media Enterprises (CME). Objections brought by the Czech Republic over the legal distinguishing of the two corporations were rejected by the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce as irrelevant.[3]
Second reincorporation[edit]
CEDC GmbH's capital interests were all transferred to CME on July the 28th, 1994.[5] CME moved its headquarters and reincorporated in Bermuda later that year.[4]
Operations[edit]
CME is the broadcast market leader in every country where it has television stations. It started broadcasting its first channel in the Czech Republic in 1994. CME operates 36 television channels broadcasting to approximately 50 million people across its six markets. CME develops and produces content for its television channels, and its content is also consumed through subscription- and advertising-based platforms.[6]
Key shareholders[edit]
On 23 March 2009, Time Warner announced that it would invest $241.5 million, for a 31% stake, in CME.[7]
Two years later on 3 March 2011, Time Warner bought another 3.1 million shares taking its stake in CME up to 34.4% with around 47 percent of voting rights and a total of 22.1 million shares.[8]
In July 2012 CME exercised its put option and Time Warner increased its economic interest in CME to 49.9%.[9]
During the second quarter of 2013, Time Warner maintained its 49.9% voting interest during a public offering of CME Class A Shares, and additionally purchased 200,000 shares of Series B Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock in a private placement.
During a rights offering and private placement in 2014, Time Warner increased its economic ownership on a diluted basis to approximately 75%.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
