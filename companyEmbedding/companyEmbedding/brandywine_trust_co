Brandywine as Fiduciary




We seek to protect our assets from the destructive effects of unnecessary taxation, third party claims, poor governance, and weak investment returns.
We pursue this objective by providing stable, efficient trusteeship, and as part of that trusteeship:

Superior planning and governance solutions
Uniform access to highest-grade investment opportunities through investment pools
Tailored asset allocation through variable participation in those pools
Rigorous and unconflicted attention to the particular fiduciary needs of each client family
