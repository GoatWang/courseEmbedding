Jan van Deursen, Ph.D. - Unity Biotechnology














































 
 








Jan van Deursen, Ph.D.Professor of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at The Mayo Clinic; Professor of Pediatrics at The Mayo Clinic

Jan is passionate about basic medical research and its potential to transform human health and treatment of disease. He has a longstanding interest in questions related to cell cycle control and cellular responses to stress. He helped establish the concept that, with aging and development of age-related disease, wasteful transformed cells that cannot divide litter tissues and organs in small numbers and demonstrated that clearance of these so-called “senescent cells” extends both healthspan and lifespan. During his Ph.D. training, Jan pioneered technologies to knock down the expression of endogenous genes in mice, and these techniques have proven to be particularly useful in uncovering the physiological function of mammalian genes essential to cell division or viability. In applying these technologies to address the longstanding question as to whether aneuploidy is a cause or a consequence of cancer, Jan discovered that BubR1 (an essential mitotic checkpoint protein that ensures faithful chromosome segregation) is causally implicated in cancer, progeria and aging. Studies originating from his desire to understand these mechanisms are credited with providing the first in vivo evidence that p16-positive senescent cells drive aging and age-related disease, thus establishing cellular senescence as a promising target for therapeutic intervention. Dr. van Deursen holds a B.S. in Biology, M.S. in Molecular Biology, and Ph.D. in Cell Biology from University of Nijmegen. He is the Vita Valley Professor of Senescence at Mayo Clinic, where he chairs the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and directs research programs in the Center for Biomedical Discovery, the Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Kogod Center on Aging. He is an Honorary Professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands and serves on numerous national and international grant review panels.

Daohong Zhou, M.D.Professor of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences

Daohong’s research focuses on radiation- and chemotherapy-induced hematopoietic stem cell injury and leukemia, development of mechanism-based strategies to protect the hematopoietic system from cancer therapy-induced damage, and novel medical countermeasures against radiological/nuclear accidents or terrorism. Daohong has published more than 50 peer reviewed scientific articles and book chapters. His research is well funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID). Daohong serves on several national and international peer review panels. He is a regular member of the Radiation Therapeutics and Biology Study Section, the panel that reviews radiation-related projects submitted to the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He has been named as the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Endowed Chair for Leukemia Research at the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute. He is also an Honorary Professor of the Peking Union Medical College in China.

AGE DIFFERENT
Imagine a future in which you age, but without the diseases your parents got.  A future in which it doesn’t hurt to grow old.
At UNITY, we design therapeutics that prevent, halt, or reverse diseases of aging. Our medicines are designed to lengthen healthspan, the amount of time you live in good health.


TARGETING A ROOT CAUSE
When the world’s over-60 population doubles to two billion in 2050, one in four humans will be old.1 Historically, old age has meant arthritis, heart disease, kidney failure, loss of eyesight, and loss of hearing. We’re targeting fundamental mechanisms at the root of age-related diseases. Our medicines could make many debilitating consequences of aging as uncommon as polio.
1Ageing and health. World Health Organization. 2015 September:
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs404/en/




FROM MECHANISMS TO MEDICINES
Our initial focus at UNITY is on selectively eliminating senescent cells.
Cellular senescence is a biological “emergency brake” cells use to stop dividing.  It’s an important anti-tumor mechanism, because it prevents cells from multiplying out of control. But after this “brake” has been pulled, senescent cells remain in the body, accumulating with age. And unlike normal cells, these cells secrete inflammatory molecules that harm neighboring cells and tissues.
UNITY has demonstrated in animal models that selectively eliminating senescent cells reverses or prevents a wide range of diseases, including osteoarthritis, atherosclerosis, eye diseases, and kidney diseases.


Pipeline
Our senolytic medicines target vulnerabilities unique to senescent cells, allowing us to eliminate them from the human body while leaving normal cells unaffected. We have pre-clinical programs in inflammatory joint diseases and ophthalmology.

ResearchPre-clinicalPhase IInflammatory joint diseases Ophthalmology AtherosclerosisIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosisChronic kidney disease

A TEAM UNITED
Members of UNITY’s management team have collectively moved 91 therapeutic candidates into human clinical trials and are responsible for the creation of 13 FDA-approved medicines.
