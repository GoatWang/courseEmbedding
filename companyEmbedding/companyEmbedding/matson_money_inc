What We Do






At Matson Money, we think investing can work to help most people reach their long-term financial goals. Unfortunately, many people get mixed messages and bad advice when it comes to how to invest. We provide long-term investment strategies for Main Street investors which help bring clarity to the investing process.
We help regular clients and families connect with an independent adviser or coach who can help them navigate the sometimes confusing and overwhelming investing process. Working as a team, we can help you get on a long-term track toward reaching your financial and investing goals.
Matson Money has a strong value for education—that means we can help you understand what your portfolio is doing and why. We strive to create an environment where investors and coaches alike are excited to attend training and coaching sessions to further understand their investments and the academics and ideas they're built around.
Understanding the origins of your investment strategy is something few investors will ever do. However, this understanding will give you a greater depth of knowledge and can create confidence in uncertain market conditions. These foundations are the underpinnings that help your investment strategy work and the underlying construction of your portfolio.

Why Matson Money






Achieve more with Coaching.
The idea of meeting with a stuffy adviser in a wood-paneled office may sound intimidating or unappealing, but don’t let the Hollywood version of what a financial adviser is prevent you from getting the guidance and support you need. While many online providers claim they can create portfolios to help you for the long-term, no computer or software can hold your hand and help you deal with the scary emotions that come with investing.
The independent advisers who work with Matson Money are provided with extensive educational and training opportunities. These training programs range from understanding portfolio engineering, helping investors understand and set proper investing expectations, to implementing a lifelong investing and financial game plan.















Always in the know.
Traditional financial advice takes on a modern twist with Matson Money’s Lifelong Game Plan. This technology (powered by eMoney) allows you to see all of your investments and assets in one place, plan for the future, track your spending and saving, and set goals for the future on your own time. You have 24‑hour access from anywhere in the world to your most important financial information.









Support and be supported.
Sometimes you just want to know you’re not in it alone. With Matson Money’s independent advisers you can attend community events and coaching sessions regularly. You will have a chance to meet other investors who are working toward their personal goals. Some may have more experience than you and others may be at the same point in their investing journey as you…either way, being in this conversation together can create great support and friends you never expected.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.
