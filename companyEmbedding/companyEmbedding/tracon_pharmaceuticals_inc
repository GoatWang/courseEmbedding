Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announce Initiation of a Phase 2a Clinical Study of DE-122 in Patients with Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration
Jul 26 17
Santen Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that Santen has initiated a Phase 2a clinical study of DE-122 in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The Phase 2a study is a randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy and safety of intravitreal injections of DE-122 in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab) compared to Lucentis monotherapy in patients with wet AMD. DE-122 is the ophthalmic formulation of TRACON’s proprietary anti-endoglin antibody, TRC105. The initiation of the Phase 2a study triggers a USD 7 million milestone payment from Santen to TRACON.


TRACON Pharmaceuticals Presents Positive Clinical Data from Trc105 and Trc102 Studies
Jun 5 17
TRACON Pharmaceuticals reported positive clinical results from multiple studies with TRC105 and TRC102 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Annual Meeting in Chicago, IL. Observed Correlation of Biomarker Status with Activity of TRC105 with Votrient® (pazopanib) in Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma. In this Phase 1b trial, patients who had greater than a 10% reduction in tumor volume following treatment with TRC105 and Votrient were significantly more likely to have lower baseline levels of soluble intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) (p=0.018) and thrombospondin-2 (p=0.041). These biomarkers will be assessed separately as part of the completed 63 patient Phase 2 trial of TRC105 and Votrient in soft tissue sarcoma and in the ongoing randomized Phase 3 TAPPAS trial of TRC105 and Votrient in patients with angiosarcoma. Observed Correlation of Biomarker Status with Activity of TRC105 with Inlyta® (axitinib) in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma. In this Phase 1b trial, patients with a partial response by RECIST 1.1 following treatment with TRC105 and Inlyta were more likely to have lower levels of soluble osteopontin (p=0.026) and higher levels of soluble transforming growth factor-ß receptor III (p=0.0028). These biomarkers will also be assessed as part of the ongoing randomized Phase 2 TRAXAR study of TRC105 and Inlyta in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Data from a Phase 1/2 Trial of TRC102 with Temodar® (temozolomide) in Patients with Solid Tumors. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) reported data from a trial of TRC102 in combination with Temodar in patients with refractory solid tumors. Based on partial responses in patients with KRAS-positive colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and non-small cell lung cancer, the NCI decided to enroll expansion cohorts in each of these tumor types at the recommended Phase 2 oral dose of TRC102 of 150 mg/m2. The authors concluded that the combination of Temodar and TRC102 is active, and DNA damage response markers (Rad51, '-H2AX and/or pNbs1) were induced in 4 of 5 paired colon biopsies, indicating DNA damage following treatment.
