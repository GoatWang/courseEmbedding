Opsisporin



Opsisporin for Uveitis Uveitis is an inflammatory process affecting the iris, the ciliary body, the choroid layer or all or part of these structures of the eye. Significant vision loss can occur in up to 35% of children and adults with uveitis and total blindness as a result of uveitis accounts for 10% to 15% of all cases. Midatech is using its Q-Sphera sustained release technology to develop OpsiSporin, a sustained release cyclosporine, for use in uveitis. Current treatments for uveitis such as systemic or local immunosuppressants and corticosteroids have limited efficacy and very poor side-effect profile, has yet to be brought to market – this is the objective of OpsiSporin.
This project is anticipated to reach clinical stage in the second half of 2018, but the intention is to partner this program globally.

About Us






An international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercialising products in oncology and other therapeutic areas.
Midatech is commercialising oncology treatment and supportive care products through its US commercial organisation, Midatech Pharma US (“Midatech US”) (formerly DARA BioSciences, Inc.). In Europe, Midatech is developing a pipeline of product candidates in clinical and pre-clinical development for diseases for which there are currently few or no treatment options available. These diseases include rare cancers including brain (glioblastoma, DIPG), and liver cancer.
Midatech’s strategy is to expand its US commercial arm as well as develop its products in-house in orphan oncology and with partners in other indications, and to accelerate growth of its business through strategic acquisition of complementary products and technologies.
All of Midatech’s product candidates derive from its two multi-applicable platform technologies that can be used alone or in combination to enable the targeted delivery (‘right place’) and controlled release (‘right time’) of existing drugs.
Midatech’s core platform is a drug conjugate delivery system based on a patented form of gold nanoparticles (GNP) combined with existing drugs for the safe and targeted release of therapeutic payloads at specific organs, cells or sites of disease.
The Group’s second platform is a sustained release technology acquired with Q-Chip that involves the consistent and precise encapsulation of active drug compounds within polymer microspheres enabling their release into the body in a highly controlled manner over a prolonged period of time.
Midatech is collaborating with a number of universities, and specialty and major pharmaceutical companies to develop its platform technologies into a broad number of products in order to achieve a range of potential revenue opportunities within priority therapeutic areas.
The Group has developed a strong intellectual property base and has a wide IP portfolio of 82 granted patents, 81 applications in process and 30 patent families covering a range of technologies.
Midatech is headquartered near Oxford, UK, with a nanoparticle manufacturing operation in Bilbao, Spain and an R&D facility in Cardiff, UK.

Q-Octreotide



Q-Octreotide for Acromegaly and Carcinoid Syndrome Acromegaly is a rare condition that results from over-production of growth hormone which causes severe disfigurement and can be fatal if not treated. Octreotide, formulated as Sandostatin LAR (SLAR) for sustained release, is already available for the treatment of carcinoid syndrome that occurs as a result of carcinoid tumours (ie hormone-producing tumours).  It is also used to decrease the production of growth hormone in people suffering from acromegaly who failed to respond to, or were not suitable for, surgery. Q-Octreotide is being developed as an alternative to SLAR. The imroved sustained release formulation used in Q-Octreotide allows the use of smaller needles, which is expected to improve patient satisfaction by reducing pain vs SLAR. Similarly, quicker and simpler reconstitution will reduce the nurse/ physician time to administer. Payers will benefit from improved economics by way of a reduction in direct medical costs such as lower drug cost, less wasted dosages and a reduced administration time. This project is expected to commence a Pilot study to compare the pharmacokinetics of Q-Octreotide versus Sandostatin LAR in humans mid-2017, followed by potential regulatory filings in 2018/19 and possible market approvals in the United States and the European Union thereafter. Midatech intends to partner this program globally, prior to commercialisation, but will co-promote the Carcinoid indication in the US.

Midatech Pharma Plc: Completion of pre-clinical liver cancer programme




















July 26, 2017 07:00 ET

 | Source: Midatech Pharma PLC






26 July 2017Midatech Pharma PLC("Midatech", "Company" or "Group") Completion of pre-clinical liver cancer programme  Midatech Pharma (AIM: MTPH, Nasdaq: MTP), the international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercialising products in oncology, today announces the successful completion of its pre-clinical programme for its wholly-owned candidate MTD119 (previously MTR104) for advanced liver cancer. The pre-clinical programme included three subcutaneous or orthotopic liver cancer xenograft models treated with the active cytotoxic compound maytansine conjugated with Midatech's gold nanoparticle (GNP) technology. The studies demonstrated potent anti-tumour activity in vivo in all efficacy models. Peak reduction in tumour growth due to MTD119 was more than six-fold (mean reduction more than three-fold) compared to the current standard of care, sorafenib, and with improved overall survival. The specific targeting of maytansine to tumour cells by MTD119 also resulted in significantly improved tolerability. MTD119 is a targeted therapy treatment for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma, which accounts for most liver cancers and is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide with almost 800,000 deaths in 20151. Currently, 95% of cases are non-curable and non-operable and median survival is less than one year, with rare and short-lived successful outcomes with existing forms of chemotherapy. Sorafenib (Nexavar) has projected 2018 annual sales of almost $1.5 billion2. MTD119 will now enter formal investigational new drug (IND) application enabling studies, with completion expected in H1 2018.  This will be followed by an expected IND submission to the US Food and Drug Administration for first in human studies to commence in 2018. Commenting on the pre-clinical results, Dr Jim Phillips, CEO of Midatech, said: "This is an important milestone in moving our MTD119 compound towards the clinic as it represents Midatech's first anti-cancer product using the Company's core proprietary GNP technology platform. We are very encouraged by the results so far and are focused on completing the formal IND safety studies over the next six months and getting the product into first in human studies in 2018." 1 World Health Organization cancer fact sheet, February 2017, www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs297/en2 www.fiercepharma.com/special-report/nexavar - Ends - For more information, please contact: Midatech Pharma PLCJim Phillips, CEOTel: +44 (0)1235 841575www.midatechpharma.com Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited (Nominated Adviser and Broker)Corporate FinanceFreddy Crossley / Duncan MonteithBrokingTom SalvesenTel: +44 (0)20 7886 2500 Consilium Strategic Communications (Financial PR)Mary Jane Elliott / Ivar Milligan / Cameron StandageTel: +44 (0)20 3709 5700Email: midatech@consilium-comms.com Westwicke Partners (US Investor Relations)Chris BrinzeyTel: +1 339 970 2843Email: chris.brinzey@westwicke.com Notes for Editors About Midatech Pharma PLC Midatech is an international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on oncology and other therapeutic areas with a US commercial operation marketing four cancer care supportive products, and co-promoting two others.

Trading Update and Notice of Results
 
Midatech Pharma (AIM: MTPH, Nasdaq: MTP), the international specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercialising products in oncology, today announces a trading update and provides notice of its interim results for the six months ended 30 June 2017.
 
The Board expects total gross revenues of approximately £5.2 million, a 37% increase from the £3.8 million recorded in the six months to June 2016, and the Company remains on-track to deliver market expectations for the full year 2017. Sales for the second half of 2016 represented 59% of full year gross revenues and the Board anticipates a similar split in 2017, subject to continued sales growth at approximately the H1 2017 vs. H1 2016 rate.
 
Commenting on trading update, Dr Jim Phillips, CEO of Midatech, said: "I am pleased to report that Midatech's US commercial business has continued to grow strongly in 2017.  Looking into the second half of the year and beyond, the group remains focused on three lead research and development programmes, the first of which, Q-Octreotide, remains on-track to release important bioequivalence data in Q4 of the current year. We anticipate similar revenue growth for H2 2017 compared to the first half of the year and being able to deliver full-year revenues in line with current market expectations."
 
Midatech expects to announce its interim results in September 2017. Dr Jim Phillips, Chief Executive Officer, and Nick Robbins-Cherry, Chief Financial Officer, will host a presentation for analysts and conference call. Details of the call will be published on the day of the results. The call will be recorded and a replay will be available for 30 days.

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.
