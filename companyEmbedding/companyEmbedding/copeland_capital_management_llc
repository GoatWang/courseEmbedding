                            All investors in an alternative investments fund must 
                            be "Accredited Investors," as defined in 
                            Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933. An 
                            investment in alternative strategies is speculative 
                            and involves substantial risks. It is possible that 
                            investors may lose some or all of their investment. 
                            In general, alternative investments involve a high 
                            degree of risk, including potential loss of principal 
                            invested. These investments can be highly illiquid, 
                            charge higher fees than other investments, and typically 
                            do not grow at an even rate of return and may decline 
                            in value. In addition, past performance is not necessarily 
                            indicative of future results.

                                      Head of Compliance. Earlier in her career

                                      Lewis & Bockius and prior to that she

                                      at SEI Investments. Sofia holds a JD from

                                      and mutual fund businesses over the last 
                                      24 months and felt it was important to add 
                                      a top tier and well respected professional 
                                      like Sofia to help oversee the legal and 
                                      compliance areas of each segment of our 
                                      business," added Brown. (read

                                      our commitment to ensuring we have both 
                                      the personnel resources and operational

                                      in AUM

CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa., Jan. 9, 
                                    2014 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- Copeland Capital 
                                    Management is pleased to announce that it 
                                    has passed a significant milestone with over 
                                    $1 Billion in assets under management. 
"While today's announcement is an important 
                                    landmark in the growth of our firm, we are 
                                    really just getting started," stated 
                                    Eric Brown, Copeland's Founder and Chief Executive 
                                    Officer. "When we began our business 
                                    development efforts three years ago, we managed 
                                    just $100 million. Since then, we have had 
                                    great success in educating the marketplace 
                                    about the effectiveness of a Dividend Growth 
                                    approach to investing across clients' entire 
                                    portfolios." 
"There is a general misconception in 
                                    the marketplace that Dividend Growth is purely 
                                    a domestic, large cap phenomenon," added 
                                    Mark Giovanniello, Copeland's Chief Investment 
                                    Officer. "While we are extremely proud 
                                    of our domestic large cap product, our research 
                                    and our performance show that it pays to appreciate 
                                    the historically strong returns and lower 
                                    risk of Dividend Growth companies across all 
                                    capitalization ranges, both in the United 
                                    States and Internationally. As a result, in 
                                    recent years, we have expanded our offerings 
                                    to include small and mid cap domestic strategies, 
                                    a domestic long-short hedge fund, an international 
                                    strategy, and both domestic and international 
                                    tactical strategies." (read

Copeland 
                                    White Paper I - Dividends & Tax Rates

June 30, 2012 - As it stands 
                                    today, barring a political compromise, the 
                                    highest tax rate payable on dividends will 
                                    jump from 15.0% to 43.4% for the 2013 tax 
                                    year. That sets up two important questions 
                                    for investors in dividend-oriented strategies. 
                                    First, how will the securities of dividend 
                                    payers and dividend growers perform relative 
                                    to the market as investors are forced to share 
                                    a larger portion of their income with the 
                                    government? And second, will companies opt 
                                    to put their cashflows to alternative uses, 
                                    such as stock buybacks or M&A, rather 
                                    than grow their dividends?

Punch-Out!! 
                                    - Q2 2017

                                    A financial time capsule from 1999 would surely 
                                    contain a slew of misguided admonishments 
                                    regarding the technology bubble. The capsule 
                                    would probably include advertisements for 
                                    day-trading from home, claims that value 
                                    investing was dead, and a push to “fire 
                                    your broker and open an online account!” 
                                    Another might read: “Don’t worry 
                                    about justifying valuations, just buy large 
                                    cap tech stocks and prepare to retire.” 
                                    Depending upon how closely one had heeded 
                                    them at the time, one would either laugh or 
                                    cringe.

                                    We find similarities to that thinking today. You 
                                    can’t pick up a financial publication 
                                    without finding articles calling for the death 
                                    of active money management. Exchange Traded 
                                    Funds (ETFs) in countless flavors suiting 
                                    every supposed need could be today’s 
                                    equivalent. The prevailing plan is to 
                                    buy the cheapest or smartest beta exposure 
                                    and prepare to retire.

                                    What happens though when stock markets ultimately 
                                    decline, and investors take a “punch 
                                    in the mouth?”
