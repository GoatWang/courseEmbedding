Retailers are interpreting social data. Call centers are using it to predict customer questions and give faster answers. And a railway executive is expecting Watson to soon detect faulty sections of track.Watson digests massives amount of information, especially natural language, and “learns” by reprogramming itself as it receives more information. In May, IBM introduced the first product it expects to be rolled out in volume: the Watson Engagement Advisor. The supermarket chain Kroger is testing it in call centers; right now Watson is consuming all of Kroger’s customer information. Imagine that a customer calls in with a question about where he can use the points from his Kroger fuel rewards program. A call center employee would ordinarily have to skim the program rules, find instructions about where points can be used, and review the customer’s account. That’s hard to do in a few seconds. That’s why half of the 270 billion annual calls to call centers, according to IBM, either are unresolved or require supervisors to get on the line. Soon a Kroger call center employee will be able to hit an ASK WATSON button to provide faster, more accurate, and more helpful support. Says Kroger chief information officer Chris Hjelm: “This can make everybody an expert.”CEO Ginni Rometty believes the enterprise of the future will be defined by three characteristics:First, data will drive every decision. Take, for example, managing attrition, an area long considered as much art as science. How do you keep talented people from leaving? In 2011, IBM launched a pilot program in one division, using Watson’s technology, to answer that question. The program examined the obvious factors, including compensation, benefits, work-life balance, and opportunities for career development. But it also made connections to data that humans might not consider. For example, the software noticed that a woman working as an industry consultant was making social media connections with people who work on cloud computing. To keep her engaged, IBM assigned her a new mentor who was senior in its cloud business. “Not only did the attrition reduce by 75%,” says Rometty of the pilot, but “what we spent in the right places went down by $100 million.” (That number factors in what it would cost to recruit, replace, and train people over several years.) IBM now uses this process throughout the company.Second, Rometty predicts that companies will use their wealth of information to create new types of goods and services. To help that along, she says, IBM will open pieces of Watson’s software code to outside developers by the end of the year so they can fuse their own good ideas with it.Third, according to the CEO, the new enterprise will make a giant leap in its ability to nurture one-on-one relationships directly with consumers. Whereas today a business can slice and dice data to the point that it can target, say, a 23-year-old single female college graduate in St. Paul, the volume of data and the ability to manage it will escalate to the point that a company can target, say, Cindy Davis of 110 Maple St. in St. Paul. IBM is also collaborating with its clients and opening new possibilities for consumers. Bridget van Kralingen, head of IBM’s business consulting division, describes a smartphone app (she says it works in the lab but hasn’t yet been commercialized) that scans a grocery store’s cereal selection and tells shoppers which option is healthiest. Collaboration between consultants, researchers and customers is fueling this ongoing innovation.(via CNN Money, IBM’s massive bet on Watson - Sep. 19, 2013)

This new business is launching two new opportunity areas for IBM -- Watson Financial Services, with responsibility for strategy, solutions and operational performance in IBM's largest industry segment; and the companywide mission for blockchain solutions, spanning R&D to go to market for the technology that holds the potential to do for trusted transactions what the Internet has done for information.

She led the build-out of multiple market-leading capabilities, all at leading edge of the clients' business agenda: The landmark partnership between Apple and IBM has lifted IBM to leadership in the market for enterprise mobility; establishing IBM Interactive Experience as the industry's foremost digital agency; and launching the world's first and largest consulting practice dedicated to cognitive business.
Previously, Bridget was General Manager, IBM North America, responsible for revenue, profit and client satisfaction for the full range of IBM's business in the United States and Canada. Before that, she led Global Business Services in Northeast Europe, Middle East and Africa.
Bridget brings more than 20 years consulting experience to her current role.

She is a trained psychologist and began her career as a researcher at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Bridget is a member of the Board of Directors of the Royal Bank of Canada.
In addition, Bridget sponsors IBM’s pro-bono initiative in microfinance, which has created a cloud-based microfinance technology platform for Latin America and an open source microfinance core banking application with the Grameen Foundation. The initiative has also designed loan products and the operating model for microfinance in South Africa.
Since 2011, Bridget has been listed as one of Fortune Magazine's "50 Most Powerful Women in Business." She was named by Euromoney magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in Finance in 2005 and one of Consulting Magazine’s Top 25 Consultants for 2006.

Van Kralingen has a new gig—at IBM, that is. In late August she was named SVP of the company’s Industry Platforms group, a role that gives her responsibility over Big Blue’s blockchain strategy. Over the past few years the longtime IBMer has had her hand in many of the tech giant’s other new growth areas. She helped close acquisitions like Bluewolf Group, a leading consulting firm that helps companies use cloud-based software applications, and landed key clients like HR software provider Workday, which recently shifted to IBM’s cloud.

Q&A: Bridget van Kralingen, SVP, IBM Global Business Services | Fortune.comSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantBridget van Kralingen, SVP, IBM Global Business Services Spencer Heyfron for FortuneConnectedThis is why IBM is interested in AfricaAdam LashinskyJun 09, 2014Bridget van Kralingen runs IBM’s (ibm) 100,000-person-plus consulting business. In an expanded version of an interview in the latest issue of Fortune, van Kralingen explains IBM’s marriage of research and consulting, its new digital agency, approach to Africa, and plan for growth.On research + consultingWhat happened in the past is that you'd really co-work with research on one-off projects. But what we've identified is that some of our clients are now looking to experiment with how to engage and how to use data for engagement with their customers, how to make sure that they are actually personalizing and segmenting. A lot of the mathematical research concepts that we use, if we actually blend them and fuse them with consulting, we're able to take them and really scale them across many, many clients.So we started this concept called the customer experience lab, which we launched last year, and within three months of starting it had 90 projects going because our clients really wanted to start to experiment. And it was all sorts of interesting things, like building psychographic profiles and understanding different ways of suggesting next-step actions.It's almost an era of runaway innovation. If you're focused on innovating with speed, this is a very interesting capability for you to use as an organization.On running a digital agencyOur digital agency works with sales, with marketing, helps build campaigns and helps build beautiful designs. So if you're a golfer and you ever get onto the Master's app, or you love tennis and you go on the U.S. Open app, and those experiences you have on there, that's the design capability that we have, which is interaction and the design of the application to pull you in and engage you in the data and suggest a next-step action for you.So when I think about the way I would describe our interactive experience, it's being able to design experiences that are engaging and really pull users in and make them want to engage and involve a reciprocal interaction between our client organization and these customers and make sure that our clients can actually deliver that experience and do it in a way the design's great, it links into the backing system, so they can use the data, and that it's safe and secure.On AfricaWe really have strong long-term growth in Africa. So we announced earlier this year a $100 million investment to bring Watson to Africa. And we will basically put the very first instance of Watson in our Kenya lab. We call it Project Lucy, and we will start bringing cognitive systems to Africa. So that's a big thing. We actually already have 12 research labs in the world. We announced one in Africa early this year as well, our Kenya lab. So that's the only one in Africa. And obviously 12 is a very small number, so for us that's a very important strategic investment. We are focused in that research lab on what we call the grand challenges of the African continent. We're trying to really mine data to help find solutions to energy, water, transportation, agriculture, and health care issues in Africa. That's a very important investment for us.We also made all our software available to African users free of charge. They can experiment and build on it and play with it. And the reason we did that is partly to help build skills, and partly to get people in Africa aware and comfortable with IBM software. So that donation obviously has a long-term impact in building skills on our software, but it's a very, very key one.And then over the last couple of years we've set up offices in Angola, Mauritius, Tanzania, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, and Kenya. And then we added as well as those another 17 countries as part of a network to provide one of the continent's leading telco leaders with IT services that it gives at the present in 17 other countries around those.And then we really focus on I think some very interesting areas in Africa. So we did—actually I ended up chairing IBM's work on microfinance. We did some work with the Grameen Foundation, a lot of pro bono work. And that's led to us doing a lot of work around banking and mobile payments around Africa, cloud solutions. We work with a number of the mobile providers on mobile payments and help expand mobile-based services.On growthWe've worked hard on our portfolio, and really if you think about the portfolio as really reflecting a set of marketplace shifts and having three co-pillars: data will be the source of competitive advantage, hence the investment in analytics. Cloud will be the basis of new business models. It will be the way businesses are run. And engagement at this more personalized, real time, mobile, individualized level will be the way in which companies get and gain both customers and employees and will become everyone's expectation.So essentially if you really boil it down, those are reasons that we think and areas, and they are what drives our investment. So in some ways, we probably cut and trimmed a lot of things that don't pertain to those things. And each of these initiatives -- our analytics capability, our cloud capability, and our engagement capability -- are the agents of the investments, and those are the ones that we believe will drive both, and we've prioritized them.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

                            Blockchain’s Role in Improving Global Food Safety







            October 19, 2016 | Written by: Bridget van Kralingen

The focus on safety throughout the global food supply chain is at an all-time high, for all the wrong reasons. The numbers of people sickened by contaminated food products continues to escalate and recalls are issued with increasing frequency.
Like virtually every other complex issue in a world dominated by data and how it’s used, the complex “system of systems” that is our global network of food production, inspection and distribution is primed for improvement via more open, transparent and fluid handling of information at every point in the journey from field to fork.


Food authentication and supply chain tracking is a critical step in quickly finding and helping address sources of contamination around the world. Blockchain presents an innovative new way to work toward achieving these goals. (Credit: IBM)

It’s high time. According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 600 million –- almost 1 in 10 people in the world –- fall ill after eating contaminated food every year, and 420,000 of them die — resulting in the subtraction of 33 million healthy life years from global societies and economies. The cost to individual lives is not the only substantial expense of foodborne illnesses.
In a recent study the estimated total national cost in the U.S. has spiked to $93.2 billion a year, an astounding increase of almost 20 percent in just the last four years. One looming issue in food safety is its provenance, which has minimal existing technology used to track food from the farm to plates.
To supply the world with millions of pounds of food, much of it must pass through many people, organizations, and governments that cultivate, influence or audit how it arrives to consumers. Collaboration and trust between governments, producers and suppliers is needed to re-establish consumers’ faith in the global food supply chain.
In a recent survey, 68 percent of consumers in the U.S. said they are not provided with enough information about what is in their food and its origins. More than 90 percent of consumers reported it is somewhat or very important to know where their food is coming from. IBM is leveraging blockchain to make the global food chain more transparent, authentic and trustworthy. Blockchain is like a computer’s operating system, regulating interactions and because it creates an immutable digital record of these transactions, it is ideal for tracing the safety and authenticity of goods as they move from food suppliers to store shelves and consumers.
A recent IBM Institute for Business Value (IBV) study on blockchain in the supply chain found by digitally tracking the provenance and movement of food throughout the entire supply chain, purveyors have instant quality assurance that the products they receive and serve customers are safe. With blockchain, this information flow can be widely shared to enhance decisions at all levels of the supply chain.
For example, “ready to eat” foods – such as frozen lasagna – top the list for recalled food products by a wide margin because they involve a large supply chain with multiple parties. Ready-to-eat food, once processed, typically requires a third party such as a logistics provider to transport the food to distribution warehouses.
Sometimes another supply chain partner provides this service and then often another intermediary provider will deliver the food from the warehouse to the store. That’s not only expensive, but maintaining the quality standards set by regulators by the USDA to keep perishable products safe is also a challenge, particularly when the product contains frozen meat, vegetables or milk products.
Putting this transaction record on the blockchain can create significant savings in time, cost and transparency. Blockchain can transparently track the provenance of goods as they are passed from one organization to the next, building awareness and trust.
Scientists from IBM Research and researchers from Tsinghua University are working alongside top talent in transaction security and authentication technology from Tsinghua University and with Walmart’s expertise in supply chain, logistics and food safety, to create a new model for food traceability, supply chain transparency and auditability using IBM Blockchain based on the open source Linux Foundation Hyperledger Project fabric.
The collaboration of Walmart, IBM and Tsinghua University takes advantage of the distinctive strengths of each member of the team. Scientists from IBM Research – China are among the leading edge technologists at IBM now in the forefront of the rapid evolution of blockchain. This can help retailers like Walmart better supervise and manage the shelf life of products and reduce the risk of non-compliance in individual stores, ensuring that consumers are getting authenticated, safe products. Which is exactly the answer required.
