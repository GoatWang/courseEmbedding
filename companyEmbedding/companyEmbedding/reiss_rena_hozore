General Counsel Q&A: Meeting Evolving Business Needs Innovates the Legal Department, Says Rena Hozore Reiss, Hyatt Hotels GC

Practical Law July 26, 2017

			Topics: Client Relations, Corporate Legal, Efficiency, Legal Innovation, Practical Law




Rena Hozore Reiss, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and Interim Chief Human Resources Officer of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, recently shared her views with Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law The Journal: Transactions & Business (PLJ) on innovation within the legal department and what advice she would offer to a prospective General Counsel.
PLJ:Are there any innovative ideas your law department has adopted to further its goals?
Reiss: We are constantly working with our colleagues to meet the evolving needs of the business. While our overall structure generally remains unchanged, we continuously think about how to partner most effectively within the company. For example, as technology and IT operations become increasingly critical drivers of our business, we have deployed additional resources to support that area.
The prioritization of privacy and cybersecurity has also led to a shift of resources and the creation of virtual teams to support those efforts. Additionally, our hotel development attorneys now work not only on hotel management agreements, but also on franchise agreements, M&A deals, and real estate transactions and financings.
Rena Hozore Reiss, GC of Hyatt Hotels
PLJ:How does the law department avoid being perceived as the “office of no” while still ensuring it helps the client avoid liability?
Reiss: Every member of the Hyatt family is focused on caring for people so they can be their best, and our legal team is no exception. We are focused on advancing the work of the company, while helping our colleagues avoid “stepping on rakes.” Saying no is certainly safe, but then we might as well shut the doors to our hotels and go find something else to do. Thanks to the relationships our legal team has built, we have a reputation of understanding the needs of our customers (both outside of the company and among our internal clients) and collaborating to find ways to meet those needs.
Members of the legal team consider themselves to be a part of the fabric of the business, and we encourage people to shed the notion that there are “business decisions” for which the legal team’s input is not useful. We bring a unique perspective to problem solving and risk analysis, and at the end of the day, we are all working to achieve the best outcome for the company and for each other.
PLJ:How do you align the incentives of external law firms with the objectives of the law department?
Reiss: We believe in true partnerships with our law firms. Our best “partners” are those who work shoulder-to-shoulder with us, appreciate the value our in-house team can offer, and are able to have fun with us in the trenches while providing subject matter expertise and incremental resources to our perpetually stretched in-house team. True external partners understand that these are must-haves in light of the fees outside counsel charge. Law firms that can achieve all of this become our go-to resources.
PLJ:What one piece of advice would you give to a prospective General Counsel?
Reiss: Be comfortable not knowing answers, but know how to get them. One way to do that is to ensure that you have a great team standing with you, because you cannot do it alone.

About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions
Close ×




About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Peer Reviews




About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

General Counsel Q&A: Meeting Evolving Business Needs Innovates the Legal Department, Says Rena Hozore Reiss, Hyatt Hotels GC

Practical Law July 26, 2017

			Topics: Client Relations, Corporate Legal, Efficiency, Legal Innovation, Practical Law




Rena Hozore Reiss, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, and Interim Chief Human Resources Officer of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, recently shared her views with Thomson Reuters’ Practical Law The Journal: Transactions & Business (PLJ) on innovation within the legal department and what advice she would offer to a prospective General Counsel.
PLJ:Are there any innovative ideas your law department has adopted to further its goals?
Reiss: We are constantly working with our colleagues to meet the evolving needs of the business. While our overall structure generally remains unchanged, we continuously think about how to partner most effectively within the company. For example, as technology and IT operations become increasingly critical drivers of our business, we have deployed additional resources to support that area.
The prioritization of privacy and cybersecurity has also led to a shift of resources and the creation of virtual teams to support those efforts. Additionally, our hotel development attorneys now work not only on hotel management agreements, but also on franchise agreements, M&A deals, and real estate transactions and financings.
Rena Hozore Reiss, GC of Hyatt Hotels
PLJ:How does the law department avoid being perceived as the “office of no” while still ensuring it helps the client avoid liability?
Reiss: Every member of the Hyatt family is focused on caring for people so they can be their best, and our legal team is no exception. We are focused on advancing the work of the company, while helping our colleagues avoid “stepping on rakes.” Saying no is certainly safe, but then we might as well shut the doors to our hotels and go find something else to do. Thanks to the relationships our legal team has built, we have a reputation of understanding the needs of our customers (both outside of the company and among our internal clients) and collaborating to find ways to meet those needs.
Members of the legal team consider themselves to be a part of the fabric of the business, and we encourage people to shed the notion that there are “business decisions” for which the legal team’s input is not useful. We bring a unique perspective to problem solving and risk analysis, and at the end of the day, we are all working to achieve the best outcome for the company and for each other.
PLJ:How do you align the incentives of external law firms with the objectives of the law department?
Reiss: We believe in true partnerships with our law firms. Our best “partners” are those who work shoulder-to-shoulder with us, appreciate the value our in-house team can offer, and are able to have fun with us in the trenches while providing subject matter expertise and incremental resources to our perpetually stretched in-house team. True external partners understand that these are must-haves in light of the fees outside counsel charge. Law firms that can achieve all of this become our go-to resources.
PLJ:What one piece of advice would you give to a prospective General Counsel?
Reiss: Be comfortable not knowing answers, but know how to get them. One way to do that is to ensure that you have a great team standing with you, because you cannot do it alone.
