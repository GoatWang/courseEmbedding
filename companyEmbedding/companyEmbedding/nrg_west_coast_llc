of titles may be held by the same individual. Any delegation
pursuant to this Section 4.2(b)  may be revoked at
any time by the Majority Members.
 

4.3.        
Meetings.
 

(a)          
The Majority Members shall constitute a quorum for the transaction
of business of the Company, and except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the act of the Majority Members present at a
meeting of the Members at which a quorum is present shall be the
act of the Members.
 

(b)          
Meetings of the Members may be held at such place or places as
shall be determined from time to time by resolution of the Majority
Members. At all meetings of the Members, business shall be
transacted in such order as shall from time to time be determined
by resolution of the Majority Members. Regular meetings of the
Members shall be held at such times and places as shall be
designated from time to time by resolution of the Majority Members.
Notice of such meetings shall not be required. Special meetings of
the Members may be called by the Majority Members, and notice of
such meeting need not state the purpose or purposes of, nor the
business to be transacted at, such meeting, except as may otherwise
be required by law.
 

4.4.        
Action by Written Consent or Telephone Conference. Any
action permitted or required by the Act, the Certificate or this
Agreement to be taken at a meeting of the Members may be taken
without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action
to be taken, is signed by the Majority Members. Such consent shall
have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote at a meeting and
may be stated as such in any document or instrument filed with the
Secretary of State of Delaware, and the execution of such consent
shall constitute attendance or presence in person at a meeting of
the Members. Subject to the requirements of the Act, the

description, independently or with others (including ones in
competition with the Company) with no obligation to offer to the
Company or any other Member or officer the right to participate
therein. The Company may transact business with any Member, officer
or affiliate thereof; provided that the terms of those
transactions are no less favorable than those the Company could
obtain from unrelated third parties.
 

4.6.        
Officers.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
