Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2013-1 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust 2013-1
    





February 27, 2013 01:13 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by Volkswagen Auto Loan Enhanced Trust (VALET) 2013-1:
    

      --Class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --Class A-2 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The weighted average (WA) FICO of 763 is 
      consistent with recently issued VALET transactions and, combined with 
      the strong internal credit tier distribution, indicates a strong 
      borrower. However, the pool contains a higher concentration of extended 
      term loans, which have experienced greater losses historically.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE): 2013-1 incorporates a sequential-pay 
      structure. Initial CE is 3.10% of the initial adjusted pool balance, 
      growing to 3.50% of the initial securitization value. Annual excess 
      spread is expected to be 1.81%. CE is sufficient to cover Fitch's 
      'AAAsf' stressed loss expectation.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquency 
      levels on VCI's portfolio and prior securitizations have improved 
      dramatically from peak levels in 2007 and 2008 and stabilized at lower 
      levels.
    

      Unstable Economic Outlook: A slower recovery and potential for 
      volatility could affect delinquencies and losses. Fitch's analysis 
      accounts for this risk by including poorer performing vintages from the 
      recent recession in the base case loss analysis.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of VCI would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      Stable Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch believes VCI to be a 
      capable originator, underwriter, and servicer. These capabilities are 
      further evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency and loss 
      experience and securitization performance.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to VALET 2013-1 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one category under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The 
      notes could experience downgrades of up to three rating categories, 
      although still remaining investment grade, under Fitch's severe (2.5x 
      base case loss) scenario.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      For more information about Fitch's comprehensive subscription service 
      FitchResearch, which includes all presale reports, surveillance, and 
      credit reports on more than 20 asset classes, contact product sales at

      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

sole beneficiary of the Issuer; and upon the issuance of the Certificate, the Seller will no longer be a beneficiary of the Issuer, except to the extent that the Seller is the Certificateholder. 
SECTION 3.2. Authentication of Certificate. Concurrently with the sale of the Transferred Assets to the Issuer pursuant to the
Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Owner Trustee shall cause the Certificate to be executed on behalf of the Issuer, authenticated and delivered to or upon the written order of the Seller, signed by its chairman of the board, its president, its chief

(VALET 2013-2)


SECTION 3.5. Transfer of Certificate. (a) The Certificateholder may assign,
convey or otherwise transfer all or any of its right, title and interest in the Certificate; provided, that (i) the Owner Trustee and the Issuer receive an Opinion of Counsel stating that, in the opinion of such counsel, such transfer
will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded partnership for federal income tax purposes and (ii) the Certificate may not be acquired by or for the account of or with the assets of a Benefit Plan or any governmental, non-U.S.,
or church plan or any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is subject to a law that is substantially similar to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (Similar Law). By
accepting and holding a Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder thereof shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not, and is not purchasing the Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of, a Benefit Plan or any
governmental, non-U.S., or church or any other employee benefit plan or retirement arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to independently determine that the requirement in (ii) above is met and
shall incur no liability to any person in the event the holder of the Certificate does not comply with such restrictions. Subject to the transfer restrictions contained herein and in the Certificate, the Certificateholder may transfer all or any
portion of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied by the documents required by this Section. Such transfer may be made by the registered Certificateholder in person
or by his attorney duly authorized in writing upon surrender of the Certificate to the Owner Trustee accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and with such signature guarantees and evidence of authority of the Persons signing the instrument
of transfer as the Owner Trustee may reasonably require. Promptly upon the receipt of such documents and receipt by the Owner Trustee of the transferors Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall record the name of such transferee as a
Certificateholder and its percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer in the Certificate register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such beneficial interest in the Issuer. In the event a transferor
transfers only a portion of its beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Owner Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing such transferors new percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer. Subsequent to a
transfer and upon the issuance of the new Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such transfer. The Owner Trustee may treat, for all purposes whatsoever, the
Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the beneficial interest in the Issuer evidenced by such Certificate, and neither the Owner Trustee, nor any agent of the Owner Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.  (b) As a condition precedent to any registration of transfer under this Section 3.5, the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges required to be paid in connection with such transfer. 
(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be obligated to register any transfer of a Certificate unless each of the transferor and the
transferee have certified to the Owner Trustee that such transfer does not violate any of the transfer restrictions stated herein including, but not limited to clauses (d) and (e) of this Section 3.5. The Owner
Trustee shall not be liable to any Person for registering any transfer based on such certifications.

(VALET 2013-2)


(d) No transfer (or purported transfer) of all or any part of a
Certificateholders interest (or any economic interest therein), whether to another Certificateholder or to a person who is not a Certificateholder, shall be effective, and any such transfer (or purported transfer) shall be void ab
initio, and no person shall otherwise become a Certificateholder if, after such transfer (or purported transfer), the Issuer would have more than 95 direct or indirect holders of an interest in the Certificates. For purposes of determining
whether the Issuer will have more than 95 holders of an interest in the Certificates, each Person indirectly owning an interest through a partnership (including any entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes), a grantor trust or
an S corporation (each such entity, a flow-through entity) shall be treated as a Certificateholder unless the Seller determines in its sole and absolute discretion, after consulting with qualified tax counsel, that less than
substantially all of the value of the beneficial owners interest in the flow-through entity is attributable to the flow-through entitys interest (direct or indirect) in the Issuer. 
(e) No transfer shall be permitted if the same is effected through an established securities market or secondary market (or the
substantial equivalent thereof) within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or would make the Issuer ineligible for safe harbor treatment under Section 7704 of the Code. 
SECTION 3.6. Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or Destroyed Certificates. If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the
Owner Trustee, or (ii) the Owner Trustee receives evidence to its satisfaction that the Certificate has been destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of ownership satisfactory to the Owner Trustee together with such security or indemnity as
may be requested by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, the Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for the same percentage of beneficial interest in the Issuer as the Certificate so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen, of like
tenor and bearing a different issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section 3.6, the Issuer or Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer and the Owner
Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.  ARTICLE IV 
ACTIONS BY OWNER TRUSTEE 
SECTION 4.1. Prior Notice to Certificateholder with Respect to Certain Matters. With respect to the following matters, the Owner
Trustee shall not take action unless at least 10 days before the taking of such action (or such shorter notice acceptable to the Certificateholder), the Owner Trustee shall have notified the Certificateholder in writing of the proposed action and
the Certificateholder shall not have notified the Owner Trustee in writing prior to the 10th day (or such shorter notice acceptable to the Certificateholder) after such notice is given that the Certificateholder has withheld consent or provided
alternative direction:  (a) the amendment of the Indenture by a supplemental indenture in circumstances where the
consent of any Noteholder is required;

where the consent of any Noteholder is not required and such amendment materially adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholder; 
(c) the amendment, change or modification of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, or the Administration Agreement, except to cure
any ambiguity or defect or to amend or supplement any provision in a manner that would not materially adversely affect the interests of the Certificateholder; or 
(d) the appointment pursuant to the Indenture of a successor Indenture Trustee or the consent to the assignment by the Note
Registrar or the Indenture Trustee of its obligations under the Indenture or this Agreement, as applicable.  SECTION 4.2. Action
by Certificateholder with Respect to Certain Matters. The Owner Trustee shall not have the power, except upon the direction of the Certificateholder, to (a) except as expressly provided in the Transaction Documents, sell the Collateral
after the termination of the Indenture in accordance with its terms, (b) remove the Administrator under the Administration Agreement pursuant to Section 8 thereof or (c) appoint a successor Administrator pursuant to
Section 8 of the Administration Agreement. The Owner Trustee shall take the actions referred to in the preceding sentence only upon written instructions signed by the Certificateholder. 
SECTION 4.3. Action by Certificateholder with Respect to Bankruptcy. The Owner Trustee shall not have the power to commence a
voluntary proceeding in bankruptcy relating to the Issuer until one year and one day after the Note Balance of all Notes has been reduced to zero without the prior written approval of the Certificateholder and the delivery to the Owner Trustee by
the Certificateholder of a certificate certifying that the Certificateholder reasonably believes that the Issuer is insolvent. The Issuer Delaware Trustee shall not have the power to commence a voluntary Proceeding in bankruptcy relating to the
Issuer and no consent or approval by the Issuer Delaware Trustee shall be required with respect to a voluntary Proceeding in bankruptcy relating to the Issuer. 
SECTION 4.4. Restrictions on Certificateholders Power. The Certificateholder shall not direct either Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any obligation of the Issuer or such Trustee under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents or would be contrary to Section 2.3, nor shall such
Trustee be obligated to follow any such direction, if given.  SECTION 4.5. Majority Control. To the extent that there
is more than one Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or instructions which may be given by the Certificateholder under this Agreement may be taken by Certificateholders holding in the aggregate a percentage of the beneficial
interest in the Issuer equal to more than 50% of the beneficial interest in the Issuer at the time of such action.

of action permitted or required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this Agreement or any Transaction Document or any such provision is ambiguous as to its application, or

If the Owner Trustee shall not have received appropriate instruction within ten days of such notice (or within such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but shall

such action or inaction.  (d) The Owner Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested
in it by this Agreement, or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation, at the request, order or direction of the Certificateholder or any other Person, unless such Certificateholder or such Person has offered to the Owner Trustee security or

hereby understood and agreed by the other parties hereto that all such duties and liabilities are replaced by the duties and liabilities of the Owner Trustee expressly set forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Trust Act. Each Trustee
nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as may be necessary to discharge any Liens on any part of the Trust Estate that result from actions by, or claims against, such Trustee that are not related to

violate the provisions of this Section.  SECTION 6.7. Rights and Protections of the Issuer Delaware Trustee. The Issuer Delaware

ARTICLE X  SUCCESSOR
OWNER TRUSTEES AND ADDITIONAL  OWNER TRUSTEES

bank (i) authorized to exercise corporate trust powers, (ii) having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and (iii) subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state authorities. If such bank shall publish
reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for the purpose of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such corporation shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. The Issuer Delaware Trustee shall at all times be an institution satisfying the provisions of Section 3807(a) of the Statutory Trust Act. In case at
any time either Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 10.2. 
SECTION 10.2. Resignation or Removal of Either Trustee. Each Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trusts hereby
created by giving written notice thereof to the Seller, the Administrator, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee and the Certificateholder. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Seller and the Administrator, acting jointly, shall promptly
appoint a successor Trustee which satisfies the applicable eligibility requirements set forth in Section 10.1 by written instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to
the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee; provided, however, that such right to appoint or to petition for the appointment of any such successor shall in no event relieve the resigning Trustee from any obligations otherwise imposed on it
under the Transaction Documents until such successor has in fact assumed such appointment.  If at any time a Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the applicable provisions of Section 10.1 and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Seller or the Administrator, or if at any time such Trustee shall be legally unable to act, or shall be
adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of such Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or control of such Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, then the Seller or the Administrator may remove such Trustee. If the Seller or the Administrator shall remove a

Trustee under the authority of the immediately preceding sentence, the Seller and the Administrator, acting jointly, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the outgoing Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor Trustee and shall pay all fees owed to the outgoing Trustee. 
Any resignation or removal of a Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall not
become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee pursuant to Section 10.3 and payment of all fees and expenses owed to the outgoing Trustee. The Seller shall provide (or shall cause to be provided) notice of such
resignation or removal of the Trustee to each of the Rating Agencies.  SECTION 10.3. Successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee
appointed pursuant to Section 10.2 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Seller, the Administrator and to its predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment under this Agreement, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor under this Agreement,
with like effect as if originally named as the Trustee. The predecessor Trustee shall upon payment of its fees and expenses deliver to the successor Trustee all documents and statements and monies held by it under this Agreement; and the Seller and
the predecessor Trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations. 
No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this Section unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall
be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1.  Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee pursuant to this Section, the
Seller shall mail (or shall cause to be mailed) notice of the successor of such Trustee to the Certificateholder, Indenture Trustee, the Noteholders and each of the Rating Agencies. If the Seller shall fail to mail (or cause to be mailed) such
notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee, the successor Trustee shall cause such notice to be mailed at the expense of the Seller. Any successor Issuer Delaware Trustee appointed pursuant to this
Section 10.3 shall promptly file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware identifying the name and the principal place of business of such successor Issuer Delaware Trustee in the
State of Delaware.  SECTION 10.4. Merger or Consolidation of a Trustee. Any Person into which a Trustee may be merged or converted
or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the corporate trust business of such Trustee,
shall, without the execution or filing of any instrument or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, be the successor of such Trustee hereunder; provided, that such Person
shall be eligible pursuant to Section 10.1; and provided, further that such Trustee shall file an amendment to the Certificate of Trust of the Issuer, if required by applicable law, and mail notice of such merger or consolidation
to the Seller and the Administrator.

SECTION 10.5. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, at any time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may at the time be located, the Seller and the Owner Trustee acting jointly shall have the power
and shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee to act as co-trustee, jointly with the Owner Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the Trust Estate, and to
vest in such Person, in such capacity, such title to the Issuer, or any part thereof, and, subject to the other provisions of this Section, such powers, duties, obligations, rights and trusts as the Seller and the Owner Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. If the Seller shall not have joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to do, the Owner Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No co-trustee or separate trustee
under this Agreement shall be required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee pursuant to Section 10.1 and no notice of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee shall be required pursuant to Section
10.3.  Each separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following
provisions and conditions:  (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee
shall be conferred upon and exercised or performed by the Owner Trustee and such separate trustee or co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Owner Trustee
joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Owner Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights,
powers, duties and obligations (including the holding of title to the Issuer or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the direction of the Owner
Trustee;  (ii) no trustee under this Agreement shall be personally liable by reason of any act or omission of any other
trustee under this Agreement; and  (iii) the Seller and the Owner Trustee acting jointly may at any time accept the
resignation of or remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.  Any notice, request or other writing given to the Owner Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this
Article. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Owner Trustee or separately, as may be
provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Owner Trustee. Each such instrument
shall be filed with the Owner Trustee and copies thereof given to the Seller and the Administrator.

Any separate trustee or co-trustee may at any time appoint the Owner Trustee, its agent or
attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee or co-trustee shall become incapable of acting,
resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Owner Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor trustee. The Owner Trustee shall
have no obligation to determine whether a co-trustee or separate trustee is legally required in any jurisdiction in which any part of the Trust Estate may be located. 
ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS  SECTION
11.1. Amendments.  (a) Any term or provision of this Agreement may be amended by the Seller, the Issuer Delaware

(b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller, the Issuer Delaware Trustee and the Owner Trustee, with
the consent of the Holders of Notes evidencing not less than a majority of the aggregate principal balance of the Outstanding Notes, for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this
Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Noteholders. It will not be necessary to obtain the consent of the Noteholders to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or consent, but it will be sufficient if such consent
approves the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents (and any other consents of Noteholders provided for in this Agreement) and of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Noteholders will be subject to such
reasonable requirements as the Indenture Trustee may prescribe, including the establishment of record dates pursuant to the Note Depository Agreement.

affects such Trustees own rights, duties or immunities under this Agreement.  SECTION 11.2. No Legal Title to Trust Estate in
Certificateholder. The Certificateholder shall not have legal title to any part of the Trust Estate. The Certificateholder shall be entitled to receive distributions with respect to its undivided beneficial interest therein only in accordance
with Articles V and IX. No transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, of any right, title or interest of the Certificateholder to and in its ownership interest in the Trust Estate shall operate to terminate this Agreement or the
trusts hereunder or entitle any transferee to an accounting or to the transfer to it of legal title to any part of the Trust Estate. 
SECTION 11.3. Limitations on Rights of Others. The provisions of this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the Owner Trustee, the
Issuer Delaware Trustee, the Seller, the Administrator, the Certificateholder and, to the extent expressly provided herein, the Indenture Trustee and the Noteholders, and nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall be construed to

have been duly given, whether or not the Certificateholder receives such notice.  SECTION 11.5. Severability. Any provision of this
Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.  SECTION 11.6.
Separate Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same
instrument.  SECTION 11.7. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements contained herein shall be binding upon, and inure
to the benefit of, the Seller, the Owner Trustee and its successors, the Issuer Delaware Trustee and its successors and the Certificateholder and its successors and permitted assigns, all as herein provided. Any request, notice, direction, consent,

administrator, a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar official with respect to such Bankruptcy Remote Party or any substantial part of its property or to consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking possession
by any such official in an involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against such Bankruptcy Remote Party, or to make a general assignment for the benefit of, its creditors generally, any party hereto or any other creditor of such Bankruptcy

(b) The Sellers obligations under this Agreement are obligations solely of
the Seller and will not constitute a claim against the Seller to the extent that the Seller does not have funds sufficient to make payment of such obligations. In furtherance of and not in derogation of the foregoing, each of the Owner Trustee (in
its individual capacity and as the Owner Trustee), by entering into or accepting this agreement, each Certificateholder, by accepting a Certificate, and the Indenture Trustee and each Noteholder or Note Owner, by accepting the benefits of this

Delaware Trustee (the Issuer Delaware Trustee), a summary of certain of the pertinent provisions of which is set forth below. To the extent not otherwise defined herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned
to them in Appendix A to the Sale and Servicing Agreement, dated as of November 13, 2013, among the Seller, the Issuer, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as indenture trustee, and VW Credit, Inc., as servicer, as the same may be
amended or supplemented from time to time.  This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the
Trust Agreement, to which Trust Agreement the holder of this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such holder is bound. The provisions and conditions of the Trust Agreement are hereby incorporated by reference as
though set forth in their entirety herein.  The holder of this Certificate acknowledges and agrees that its rights to receive
distributions in respect of this Certificate are subordinated to the rights of the Noteholders as described in the Indenture, the Sale and Servicing Agreement and the Trust Agreement, as applicable. 
THIS CERTIFICATE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
