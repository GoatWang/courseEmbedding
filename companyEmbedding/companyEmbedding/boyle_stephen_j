Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Stephen J Boyle's Experience
Title: Associate Member
               Company: Greater Lehigh Valley Auto Dealers Association
Job Details
               The Greater Lehigh Valley Auto Dealers Association (GLVADA) is serving as Presenting Sponsor of Cumulus Media's "Putting the Greater Lehigh Valley Back to Work" job fair, scheduled for Tuesday, July 30th, from 11:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The job fair, being held at the ArtsQuest center at SteelStacks in Bethlehem, will include many booths, each manned by local companies looking to hire. GLVADA and its members will host an auto industry-specific career pavilion to distribute material and provide an opportunity for local dealerships to expand their talented workforce. "In 2011, GLVADA dealerships contributed 2,550 direct employment opportunities to the Greater Lehigh Valley," said Tom Kwiatek, executive director of GLVADA. "In addition, the average GLVADA dealership employed 51 people in the same year, paying more than $2.6 million for payroll and in benefits. Our dealers take pride in our role in supporting the local economy and as well as providing an opportunity for our neighbors to be gainfully employed. We are proud to extend that responsibility to this important event and look forward to participating." In January, GLVADA participated in the first Cumulus Media-led job fair of the year where organization representatives and dealership personnel spoke with more than 300 people and obtained more than 120 applications and resumes for open positions at Lehigh Valley auto dealers. In addition to GLVADA, 59 other organizations have been previous sponsors of the job fair, including the Army National Guard, Lehigh University, PPL and Sands Casino Resort, among others.
