Bonds

The bond managers handle the entire spectrum of bond investments, with a broad range of conventional and innovative solutions:Innovative and active allocation strategies are independent of conventional benchmarked approaches.Our pure directional approaches tap into the carry of asset classes (credit or inflation) without exposure to interest rates variations.A bond allocation approach with two separate and complementary performance drivers aiming to offer a highly robust solution regardless of market configuration. 







Cash management solutions

More than one third of assets managed by CPR AM are in money-market and short term funds, which focus on : optimising liquidity, risk taking that is adjustable to market conditions and daily and close monitoring of risks.
