Have fun with wall decor.If your floor space is limited, it’s important to make the most of your walls by using every inch for home decor. If your walls are looking a little barren, spice them up with colorful artwork. Your own photo collage can add a personal touch to any room, while mirrors can make a small space seem larger thanks to their reflective qualities. If storage is an issue, use shelves and stack them with fun trinkets or flowers. Don’t forget about the wall itself! Add some flavor with colorful, patterned wallpaper or go for a brightly painted accent wall. Home decorations make great table toppers.If your living room needs a lift, liven it up by adding a few thoughtful home decor accessories. Photos always make great additions, but keep them interesting by mixing and matching your frames. When lit, candles add a romantic, relaxing feel, and coffee table books about travel, home design, fashion or photography make for great conversation starters. House decorations can cozy up your floor.While floor space may be limited, there’s always room for a well-placed area rug or two. These are a great way to add texture, color and warmth to a hardwood or tile floor. Choose a traditional floral pattern or some funky chevrons to get started, then pair your  pattern with a textured Berber rug or soft shag for ultimate indulgence. Add some vibrancy to neutral-colored furniture. One of the easiest ways to punch up a look is through the fabric you display. Swap out throw pillows and blankets to liven up a dull home decor foundation, and search right here on Houzz for bold or mismatched patterns, comfy throws and cushy pillows. Don’t forget the drapes.Dress up your windows with elegant, bold or even light and airy treatments. Because of their size, floor-length curtains can make a dramatic difference and can transition a room from traditional to contemporary all by themselves.

Rugs from Amazon.comEven if your gaze is primarily towards the stars or the horizon, the laws of gravity compel us to keep our feet firmly on the ground. Throughout history, from the plush beauty of traditional Persian-style rugs to the clean, natural elegance of a bamboo or sea grass mat, we humans have been making the ground under our feet beautiful with rugs, carpets, and runners.

At Amazon.com, you can find a huge selection of rugs in a wide variety of styles and materials. You’ll find everything from braided runners to add a textured look to your hallway, to the clean and modern style of sculptured area rugs, to large and small rectangular rugs. Rugs with handmade tassels can also add a rustic and worldly feeling to any lounge or living room. Choose from a vast selection of silk, sea grass, leather, cotton, wool, acrylic, or chenille pieces.

Our sports-themed items are great for the sports lovers in the family. You can find rugs with your favorite football, baseball, basketball, or hockey team logo printed on it to create your own Fan Zone in your family room. We also have many animal-themed pieces, such as elephants, zebra stripes, or birds. A faux-fur bearskin rug makes a great addition to a man cave or a lodge-themed room.

Kids’ area rugs are another quick and easy way to cover a large amount of floor space while protecting your flooring and your little one’s hands and knees. Before you make your purchase, be sure to measure the space where you want to place your new children’s rug. Using templates or taping off floor areas can really help you visualize which kids’ rug size and shape you really want. What children’s rug material works best?Children’s rugs need to be extremely durable as well as soft and cozy. Depending on the age of your child, you may even want a rug that he or she can take a nap on. While comfort is a key consideration (think plush shags and sheepskin rugs), cleanliness and hygiene should also be of utmost concern when it comes to the textiles that will be in close contact with your child’s skin. Make sure toxic chemicals and glues aren’t present by choosing nursery rugs with a simple and unobtrusive backing. Look for a kids’ rug that is made of washable materials and has a lower pile height that won’t harbor bacteria. You might even opt for a children’s rug that’s been made for a school classroom and carefully designed for children’s safety and health. What pattern do I want on my nursery rug?If you’re having trouble deciding on a pattern for your children’s rug, consider one that’s interactive. Many kids’ rugs come with map or dollhouse design — some even come preprinted with game graphics like hopscotch, tic-tac-toe or bingo. You can even take this a step further with educational nursery rugs that feature maps, puzzles and vocabulary words. If you’re looking to complement a bedroom theme, there are many whimsical colors, patterns and characters you can choose from, too. As with any kid-related decor, try to choose a design, character or graphic that your child won’t grow out of quickly. Better yet, invite your child to sit beside you during your online shopping trip and let him or her pick out a favorite kids’ rug!United StatesUnited StatesUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndiaCOMPANYAbout HouzzIn the NewsPress InfoCareersContact UsTerms & PrivacyCopyright & TrademarkEXPLORE HOUZZButtons & BadgesMobile AppsAdvertiseFor ProfessionalsSell on HouzzWrite a ReviewFAQsCONNECT WITH USHouzz BlogTwitterFacebookGoogle+YouTubeRSSUnited KingdomAustraliaDeutschlandFranceРоссия日本ItaliaEspañaDanmarkSverigeIrelandSingaporeNew ZealandIndia© 2017 Houzz Inc.

Because rugs take up a lot of surface space, finding a design that enhances your current design is key. Whether you're looking for a kitchen rug, textured sisal rug or an outdoor rug, there is something out there for everyone. As you browse potential new    rugs, here's what you should consider: More

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat size   rug works best for my space?There are a lot of traditional rules when it comes to the correct rug size, but most designers today will encourage you to break those rules. It's your call, but keep in mind what is both functional and aesthetically pleasing. Look to your furniture to determine the size; in a living room,   rugs should offer plenty of coverage from one sofa to the next. After all, if there are too many gaps, its small size will be easy to notice. You should also keep in mind architectural cues. One near the front door is often just large enough to slightly surpass the door frame, while a narrow hallway requires equally narrow runner rugs. In the end, your space and furniture will dictate the size more than anything else.What material should my   rug be made of?Some rugs are more durable than others, so before you pick out your favorite  pattern, determine how much traffic the space is going to get. For a high-traffic entryway, jute rugs and sisal rugs can be good choices, since they tend to hide dirt and show less wear and tear. Cotton, synthetic and wool rugs work well for larger areas in bedrooms and living rooms — they come in fun  colors and offer more cushion. If you love luxury more than practicality, you can always opt for silk or fur options. Regardless, be sure you keep your family in mind as well; silk and fur don't mesh well with little kids or family pets. And don't forget rug pads — these handy additions help you avoid creating an accidental slip and slide.What style   accent rug should I look for?Because it's one of the largest decorative pieces in your space, it should accurately reflect your style. For those with traditional tastes,   Persian rugs and floral patterns are go-to options, while geometric patterns and bright colors are trendier and more contemporary. In the end, it's great to mix and match   rugs and decor, but avoid conflicting patterns and colors.
