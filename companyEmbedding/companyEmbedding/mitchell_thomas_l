How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Mitchell Thomas L carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Mitchell Thomas L currently holds license 0031609 (Certified General Contractor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Mitchell Thomas L



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Mitchell Thomas L



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Mitchell Thomas L



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Mitchell, Thomas Livingston - botanical collector










        Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria
          Australian National Herbarium
Biographical Notes





Home 
  > CANBR | CHAH > Collectors & Illustrators > Biography 


Mitchell,
 Thomas Livingston (Sir) (1792 - 1855)
Born in Stirlingshire, Scotland, on 15 June 1792, died in Darling Point,
New South Wales, on 5 October 1855.

After a military career, Mitchell arrived in Sydney, New South Wales,
in 1827 to take up the position of Deputy Surveyor-General. On Oxley's
death in 1828 he became Surveyor-General, and held the position until 1855.
He led four major expeditions, to north-western New South Wales in 1831,
to Bourke and down the Darling River in 1835, along the Lachlan River to
the Murrumbidgee and Murray Rivers and into western, central and north-eastern
Victoria in 1836, and to mid-western Queensland in 1845-1847. Botanists
accompanied him in 1835 (Richard Cunningham,
killed early in the expedition), 1836 (John
Richardson) and 1845-1847 (William Stephenson). The first three
expeditions were described in Three Expeditions into the Interior of
Eastern Australia (1838), in which John
Lindley described 77 new species of plants. Mitchell's collections
are at BM (specimens sent to Brown, and others donated later by Mitchell),
CGE (those sent to Lindley) and K (specimens sent to W.Hooker).
A few are also at E, GH, L, MEL, NSW, TCD and W. Mitchell also presented
a collection to the Australian Museum, later transferred to the Sydney
Botanic Gardens, New South Wales, and rediscovered in a dilapidated state
in 1896 (Gilbert, 1986).

Mitchell, Thomas L
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Washington:













Does Mitchell, Thomas L carry a valid contracting license?



Any work that impacts the value of real estate in Washington, requires a licensed contractor.
Mitchell, Thomas L currently holds license 4132 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Washington?



The Washington State Department of Labor & Industries requires licensees to maintain a bond and liability insurance for the protection of consumers.











Your liability risk when hiring Mitchell, Thomas L



Licensed contractors in Washington are required to maintain general liability coverage that includes a $50,000 property damage policy and $200,000 public liability policy; or $250,000 combined single limit policy.











Financial recourse when hiring Mitchell, Thomas L



Licensed general contractors in Washington are required to maintain a $12,000 bond and specialty contractors are required to maintain a $6,000 bond. This provides consumers with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The standard board recommendation is to get at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
