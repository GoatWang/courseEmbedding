Connecting PartsThe reasonable variety of the easylift connecting parts knows only one measure... your daily experience!
 





 

For precise and controlled force development, connecting parts that guarantee movement and force transfer in an ideal way are a necessity. Our comprehensive range of hinge eyes, clevises, elbow joints, ball joints, and metal fittings will fit nearly every mounting requirement.
 
In regards to connecting parts, there will be new requirements from time to time for our easylift® system. Rest assured, if the prospective application can be solved with easylift® gas springs, we will also solve any issues regarding connecting parts and end fittings.
 
Please note that the length of gas springs will change depending on your choice of end fitting. The length of easylift® gas springs is calculated as follows:
 

From mid-boring to mid-boring for hinge eyes, clevises, and hinge heads.
From mid-ball to mid-ball for elbow joints. Note: Without connectors, the thread length is not included.

 
Please see the following pages for technical data and dimensions of standardized connecting parts of the Bansbach easylift® system.

THOMASVILLE, Ga., Nov. 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The board of directors of Flowers Foods (NYSE:   FLO) announced today it has elected two new board members: Rhonda O. Gass, vice president and chief information officer of Stanley Black & Decker, and Richard Lan, retired chief operating officer of Maple Leaf Food Group and chief executive officer of its former Canada Bread subsidiary. Gass and Lan will join Flowers Foods' board of directors effective January 3, 2016. 
"The elections of Mrs. Gass and Mr. Lan are in keeping with Flowers' long-term board succession plan," said George E. Deese, chairman of the board of Flowers Foods, "and their respective experiences and expertise nicely complement the current capabilities of the board."
Commenting on the board members' election, Allen L. Shiver, Flowers' president and chief operating officer, said, "Mr. Lan's experience in the food and baking industries enhances the composition of our board. Mrs. Gass' expertise in information technology and strategic planning also strengthens the board's depth. We look forward to their contributions as the board guides Flowers Foods' development and growth strategy."   
Gass has served as vice president and chief information officer for Stanley Black & Decker since 2012 and was named an executive officer of the company the same year. She is responsible for Stanley Black & Decker's comprehensive and cross business unit IT strategy, delivery and support, and security infrastructure. She also leads the functional transformation activities for the company, focusing on effectiveness and efficiency. Previously, she was vice president of strategy, technology, and governance for Dell, where she worked for 12 years in positions of increasing scope and responsibility. She holds an undergraduate degree in computer science and a master's in business administration from the University of South Carolina.
Lan spent 20 years with Maple Leaf Foods/Canada Bread Ltd., Canada's largest food processing company. He was chief operating officer of Maple Leaf Food Group, which included both Maple Leaf's animal protein and bakery businesses. Lan also served as chief executive officer of Canada Bread Ltd., which was publicly traded and 90% owned by Maple Leaf Foods until it was sold in 2014. Prior to his career with Maple Leaf, Lan held management positions at other food and beverage companies, including Dell Products Corp. and McCain Foods, Ltd. He holds a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Rhode Island.
