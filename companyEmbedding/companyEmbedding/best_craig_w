How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Pennsylvania:













Does Craig W Craig carry a valid contracting license?



Anyone who owns or operates a home improvement business or who offers, performs, or agrees to perform home improvements in Pennsylvania must register with the Office of Attorney General. New home builders do not have to register and are exempt from the regulation but must meet all applicaple building codes.
Craig W Craig currently holds license PA063675 (Carpentry), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Pennsylvania?



Contractors in Pennsylvania do not have to take an exam prior to registering as home improvement contractors. 











Your liability risk when hiring Craig W Craig



Registered home improvement contractors in Pennsylvania must show proof of general liability insurance with minimum coverage of $50,000, workers' compensation insurance is not required. It is a good idea to only hire contractors with current general liability and workers' compensation policies. Be sure to request copies of insurance certificates for each before any work begins. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Pennsylvania, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

THANK GOD!  This was both a Personal Injury and Workman’s Comp case.  Where do I start?  ALL of his staff is AMAZING!  I worked with both Craig Kenny and Leon Symanski personally and the level of representation was beyond anything I could ever comprehend.  I didn't have to worry about a thing.  They offered to come to my house for my initial consultation.  Free.  I had a neurosurgeon that I didn't feel 100% comfortable with.  To change doctors in a WC case can be difficult.  They were able to change my doctors twice (per my request).  Not only did they handle this, but they were concerned about the level of care I was receiving from my doctor and Leon Symanski PERSONALLY met me at my doctor’s appointment to ensure I was receiving the level of care he felt I was entitled to.  What attorney does this?  Seriously.  Mr. Symanski did this again on one other occasion.  I have had many problems with my Workman’s Comp case worker and my attorneys and their staff always handled any problems I had with him.  This includes getting authorizations to have procedures done, calling to find out where my disability check was (and this would get corrected immediately), getting appointments approved and always kept the process moving.  I never felt like an inconvenience, always a priority.  I always received a call back the same day I called or when they would say they would call back.  My case was approximately 2 ½ years in length (due to procedures and surgeries I needed).  The settlement process was easy and I was very happy with the outcome.  They always kept me informed and explained everything going on with my case in detail the entire time (and they were also kind enough to translate legal “lingo” into the English language).  Mr. Kenny met with me personally on numerous occasions and ALWAYS made me feel like he truly personally cared about me.  He answers his phone if he’s in the office (and available) and if I left a voicemail he ALWAYS called me back the SAME day.  No joke!  He is amazing!  I couldn't ask for a better experience during such a trying time in my life.  It was one of the most difficult times I have ever been through.  Not only for me but also for my children.  I felt like I had a second family at CPK & Associates who were always there to assist me with whatever I needed.  What it comes down to is if you are in need of a Personal Injury and/or Workman’s Comp attorney and you want one that truly cares about YOU and your well-being, this is who you need to call.  I even received a traffic ticket and it was handled in a jiffy.  So I have had the pleasure of experiencing CPK's traffic services as well.  What it comes down to is I promise you will be nothing but thankful you called here.  I hope I won't need to go through another ordeal like this again, but if I do, this will ALWAYS been the man I call.  THANK YOU Craig Kenny, Leon Symanski and all of your staff!  You sincerely and truly changed my life!Law Offices of Kenneth G FrizzellColleen J. ratedI will write how Kenneth  Frizzell helped  me and a male veteran's soon to be ex wife from Thailand. 1st Eva's American veteran husband was divorcing her.  He was pulling in after federal taxes: example: $8,596 a month with his USAF pension, City pension, VA medical pension, Social Secuirty.  Eva was only going to get about example: $750.00 a month from her social Secuirty.  George was going to stick her will all the bills.  I bought her to Kenneth in 8/2013.  Eva agreed to hired Kenneth as her divorce attorney. He had her signed a moral contract.  The 1st part is what his guidelines will be as your attorney.  The 2nd part is what your guidelines are as his client.  In the contract he explains his fees are ala carte which for a certain amount he will do this.  They both signed.  Kenneth told Eva do not lived with your ex husband or talked to him while you are divorcing him which took only 60 days.  Do not break the law and be honest with your attorney.  The bills were split 50/50.  Eva received her social Secuirty amount: whatever it truely is:  plus a fair alimony from her ex husband after 27 years of marriage.  When Kenneth moved from his old office to is new office,  I was happy to find out some of his old office employees left his law firm.  They were not nice, lied to the clients and were rude to a few female veterans. Business is business.  I have no idea if it is in writing how much you will be charge for your case, how anyone can claimed they were rip off.    All attorneys charge a basic fee.  As the case goes on you will have to handle additional cost to your attorney.  Most attorney are suppose to tell you in writing if there are additional costs. Ala carte is better one price you get this.  If you need another issue this is the cost.  Time is money so you are paying for their time. Civil/criminal cases can drag on for months & there are additional court cost as well.  It is a signed contract.  It is in writing how to behave while he is handling a court case which means do not get into trouble if you are going to court.  That would impact your current case.  Listen to your attorney becuz isn't that why you hired him to handle your case.? Let's be honest if you get a DUI in Nevada you will not always walked with a parking ticket. If an attorney can promise he can make it disappear, he will disappear with your money!!   This is Nevada kinda consider "Good Old Boy State".   If Kenneth tells you to go to traffic school for the DUI/traffic ticket.  Go!!  An attorney is a person you hired you help you out of a screw up but they are not fairies who have a magical wand to make it like it never happened.I was dealing with an ex boyfriend who is in law enforcement.  Let's be honest.  If a cop does not want an attorney to help you,  it does not matter how much money  you are willing to pay.  Most attorneys will not give you the time of day.  Kenneth told me I could go to court or he could write a letter of intent for a smaller fee.  I hired him for the letter.  I managed to get back from my ex boyfriend, items my foster mother left  me.A Fresh Start Lawchristopherr289 ratedI called around to several lawyers to get prices on how much a bankruptcy would cost me. A Fresh Start was one of the first places I called & attorney Dorothy Bunce candidly told me she did not have the cheapest price in town, so I kept calling until I found someone who gave me a really good price. Bit mistake! First off, the price I was quoted wasn’t the price I got after the attorney added in all the extras. Second, I got no face time with the attorney beyond the first 5 minutes of the "free consultation." Third, I had to practically do the bankruptcy myself - the paralegal gave me more than 20 pages of paperwork to fill out, and every time I had a question, I couldn’t ask the attorney for an answer, I had to ask the paralegal. Who knows if the advice she gave me was correct or not? Finally, at the courthouse, my attorney and the Fresh Start Attorney, Dorothy Bunce, sit next to each other. Dorothy is laughing and talking to the Judge and the court staff, while my attorney is playing games on his tablet. Dorothy’s cases get called first, and her clients have no problems. They leave the courtroom smiling and happy. My case gets called and the Judge tells my attorney that I have to come back because he hasn’t provided my pay stubs, bank records, and tax returns. My attorney blames me for not giving him these documents, which is a total lie! So I have to take off work again in two weeks and drop off another copy of my pay stubs, bank records, and tax returns to the paralegal. So I had to ask myself how much did I really save by using that cheap attorney? So I called A Fresh Start and asked Dorothy what her fees were. The price I was quoted included the court fees, the credit report, and the credit counseling, and Dorothy didn't try to hide what all the expenses involved were. The total amount she charged turned out to be less than what I paid my cheap attorney after having to pay for the cost of correcting all his mistakes. There might be some good cheap attorneys out there, but next time I need an attorney, I will look for one that doesn’t focus on providing cheap service.A Fresh Start Lawaamanda639 ratedLast week I called Attorney Dorothy at A Fresh Start 5 times - 4 times she picked up the phone herself, and the 5th time she returned my call within a couple of hours.  After meeting with her, I was sad to learn that she wasn't able to take my case, but she certainly gave me a lot of useful advice. Dorothy Bunce met me at 7 am on a Saturday morning since I work very long hours.  I needed advice for my Dad, whose house has gone into foreclosure. I have never met with a lawyer for any reason before & was very surprised that Dorothy explained 4 different ways that Dad could save his house - and 3 of those ways did not involve hiring her!  This attorney truly puts helping people before making money. We recently moved to Las Vegas after being driven out of our small hometown by the bank that foreclosed on our business.  We filed bankruptcy with attorney Dorothy Bunce.  Before Court, Dorothy described a gossipy conversation she had with the bank's lawyer, the one that had been so mean to us, saying how much heat the bank got because of how badly they treated us.  Apparently our friends & neighbors raised quite a stink & complained loudly.  Many even took their business elsewhere.  At hearing this news, which that attorney never would have told us, my wife started sobbing with emotion at knowing how much people care for us.  I can't think of another lawyer that would have broken down the bank's attorney like Dorothy did & gotten him to tell her this secret information.  The fact that Dorothy understood how much it means to both of us to know that people do not despise us for having had a business failure & not paying our bills makes her a one in a million.  Thank God we found her to take our case!A Fresh Start LawDale E. ratedAfter losing my marriage and a job, I was drowning in debt.  I had actually considered suicide.  I know that sounds overly dramatic, but it's the truth.  Finally getting up the nerve to seek legal advice, I saw two other attorneys in town.  I left their offices hopeless and in tears.  I then found Dorothy.  My self esteem was already through the floor, but Dorothy made me feel that everything was not my fault.  We discussed my situation and possible solutions over a cup of coffee at her office.  I immediately felt like I was talking with a trusted old friend.  She never made me feel bad or questioned how I got myself into such a financial pickle!  And don't be fooled by her niceness - she knows what she's doing!  She outlined everything that was going to happen with a Chapter 7.  We discussed all the options available to my situation.  I left her office with a folder containing not only all her contact information, but helpful articles, documents and timelines.  After the process got rolling, she communicated everything with me, coaching me as to what paperwork was due now, what the next step would be, etc.  When we finally got to the 341 meeting, I was prepared, calm and collected.  How much is that worth?  The whole process went through in about 4 months, smooth as silk, just as Dorothy said it would.  And all this for one fixed price.  I cannot give Dorothy enough praise or higher recommendations.  Do yourself a favor.   Hire this woman.  You will not be disappointed.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

						When Pierce Brosnan quit as 007, I stopped caring about James Bond.

I've run out of movies to watch, but im still in a 007 mood. Knowing that the Daniel Craig Bond movies aren't as good, I need to know... what is the best one to watch?

						They are both better than the Brosnan movies.  I say Casino Royale is better than Quantum of Solace though.

						Yeah, I think we can all agree "Goldeneye" and "The World Is Not Enough" are the pinacle of the entire series.

I will agree that Goldeneye was easily the best of the Bond movies up to Brosnan's end and I don't dislike any of Brosnan's films, but Craig's movies feel like completely different movies.  More Bourne than Bond so I think that makes them feel like more serious movies.

Is Judi Dench still playing 'M'?

That's a big selling point for me, I just d/l'ed Casino Royale... I'd like to see SOME familar faces (I think Casino Royale is the first movie without 'Q')

						Casino Royale and Golden Eye are both great Bond films. It's just that they're two different types of films with two different types of Bond. I can see why some would not like one or the other but I think they're both great.

Yes Judi Dench is still M which is something that honestly bugged me.  They went to the point of rebooting everything and getting rid of Q, Moneypenny and most of the Bond fixtures but retained the same person playing M.

						Casino Royale is loads better than any of the Brosnan films, and Quantium i'd put on the level of say a Thunderball or Diamonds are Forever. So all of them i'd put over any and all Roger Moore films. 
And for some reason starting with Casino Royale they made Alex and now Moneypenny black and now Q is 31 in the current one they're filming .

						Watch 'Layer Cake' with Daniel Craig.  Excellent flick.

It's not a Bond movie.

Felix Leiter is also being played by Jeffery Wright.  I like that they kept him as Leiter from Casino to Quantum allowing some continuity and keeping a relationship with Bond.

Also, yes Layer Cake is quite good as well.  It's the movie Guy Ritchie should have kept making.

Depends. How do you define pinnacle? Because if you are saying that those two are the best movies in the entire pre-Craig franchise, better than any of Connery's work, you are wrong. I'm still very fond of the first four.

And Daniel Craig wasn't in Milk. However, he is the one with the most impressive pre-Bond/Bond-era resume out of all the Bonds.

						Goldeneye is the best Bond film overall. I'd be hard pressed to even name a close second. Casino Royale is the better of the two Craig movies, but you'd be better served watching one of the "Bourne" movies, all of which are better than the Craig Bonds they inspired.

I was able to sit through Quantum of Solace despite being completely disappointed with Casino Royale when I saw it in the theater.  Last week I tried to rewatch Casino Royale for the first time since, but turned it off after the credits.  If you're a fan of Bond films, then you know that the credits sequences used to be amazing pieces of work in their own right; done primarily with practical special effects.  Now it is one long shitty cgi sequence.  What makes Bond "Bond" is not present in the Daniel Craig movies - though Quantum of Solace did remind me of some of the misdirection present in License to Kill.

						I'll have to watch QOS again.  I saw it in theaters and didn't love it.  I really really enjoyed Casino Royale mainly because it was the polar opposite of Die Another Day which I feel is the worst since AVTAK.  

Best by actor:
Connery - Goldfinger
Lazenby - duh
Moore - Spy Who Loved Me
Dalton - License to Kill
Brosnan - GoldenEye
Craig - Casino Royale

Worst by actor:
Connery - Diamonds Are Forever
Moore - A View to a Kill
Dalton - Living Daylights
Brosnan - Die Another Day

Die Another Day was like a science fiction movie.  It was such a departure from the entire series I saw nowhere else for Bond to go.  As far as the best by series I've just rewatched all the movies this month and can't disagree with the best for the different Bond's but for Connery's I think it's hard to pick Goldfinger above equally good Dr. No and From Russia With Love.

						I think From Russia with Love is my favorite Bond movie.

And QoS had horrible CGI. It's why the only scene people remember from the movie was the opera scene.

Which was the Roger Moore movie that had Bond dressed as a clown? And I haven't seen these in awhile but was AVTAK worse than Moonraker? I remember that one being pretty rank.

Octopussy was the one where he dressed as a Clown.  That's probably Moore's 2nd best.  Moonraker was easily Moore's worst film, but there isn't much positive to say about AVATK.

2017's 10 “Top Rated” Diet Pills


#1 Apidren

Apidren has jumped to the top of the ratings in just about every category as the #1 diet pill! Recognized by ConsumerPriceWatch as the most powerful diet pill on the market for close to a decade, this all-natural formula makes controlling your appetite and regaining your confidence as easy as possible. With the results users are seeing from Apidren, we were not surprised to see Apidren has the highest re-order rate. Apidren has dominated the effectiveness and ingredient ratings because of its unique ingredients. They are clinically proven to reduce BMI, decrease body fat, shrink waistline and deliver significant weight loss.
There’s never been a better formula to help you reach your weight loss goals with patented, clinically-proven and all-natural ingredients.

#2 Fenphedra









Overall Value:

97/100


Effectiveness:

99/100


Speed of Results:

99/100


Product Safety:

89/100


Ingredients:

95/100


Long-Term Results:

98/100


Guarantee: 90 Days






Suggested Retail Price: $129.95
Lowest Price Online: $69.95
Money Back Guarantee: 90 Days
Lowest Price Online »




We see Fenphedra as the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill we have ever reviewed. Fenphedra notoriously claims to have revealed the secret to lasting weight loss. While such claims have yet to be verified, we know the science behind leptin and NPY to be solid.  The fat loss potential of these two chemical processes is mind-boggling and may be the focus of future weight loss research!
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain Chromax. Fenphedra combines Green Coffee Bean and Caffeine, which have been shown to significantly reduce body fat,  BMI and trigger fat oxidation. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More

Fenphedra is the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill for women we have ever reviewed. It stimulates what is known in the scientific community as CART, inhibiting NPY. The fat loss results of these two chemical processes are mind-boggling.
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill for women  if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine and prescription-strength pain relievers. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain phenylethylamine. Often referred to as the “Love Drug,” phenylethylamine is extracted from cocoa and responsible for the “chocolate high” sensation. Fenphedra also contains Green Coffee Bean, Chromax and Dicaffeine Malate, which dramatically burn fat, suppress appetite, and increase energy. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market like banned diet pills for women. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More

OxySelect Pink is an advanced thermogenic and is the only diet pill specifically formulated to enhance the curves of a woman’s body. While other products contain stimulants and huge quantities of dubious fillers and preservatives, OxySelect Pink uses clinically-tested, all-natural extracts designed to help you lose weight. OxySelect Pink is one of the best choices for women looking to get leaner.
As women age, the #1 reason for weight gain is hormonal imbalance. In fact, hormonal imbalance can lead to unwanted weight gain, adult acne, loss of sexual desire and sagging breasts. When you correct this imbalance, you begin to lose body fat, overcome acne, naturally lift and enhance breast tissue, and improve libido! OxySelect Pink was formulated for women by women, and the results are incredible and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee! Read More

We see Fenphedra as the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill we have ever reviewed. Fenphedra notoriously claims to have revealed the secret to lasting weight loss. While such claims have yet to be verified, we know the science behind leptin and NPY to be solid.  The fat loss potential of these two chemical processes is mind-boggling and may be the focus of future weight loss research!
Fenphedra could have easily been our #1 rated diet pill if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain Chromax. Fenphedra combines Green Coffee Bean and Caffeine, which have been shown to significantly reduce body fat,  BMI and trigger fat oxidation. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More

Fenphedra is the most “controversial” and powerful diet pill for men we have ever reviewed. It stimulates what is known in the scientific community as CART, inhibiting NPY. The fat loss results of these two chemical processes are mind-boggling.
Fenphedra could have easily been our 1# rated diet pill for men  if not for its safety concerns. There have been rumors Fenphedra contains phentermine and prescription-strength pain relievers. Any rumors of such claims are completely false, but Fenphedra does contain phenylethylamine. Often referred to as the “Love Drug,” phenylethylamine is extracted from cocoa and responsible for the “chocolate high” sensation. Fenphedra also contains Green Coffee Bean, Chromax and Dicaffeine Malate, which dramatically burn fat, suppress appetite, and increase energy. Finding bottles of Fenphedra in the U.S. can be difficult because rumors are flourishing that it may be taken off the market like banned diet pills for men. Fenphedra retails for $130 per bottle and comes with a 100% money-back guarantee. The cheapest place to buy online occasionally has bottles available for as low as $69.95. Read More
