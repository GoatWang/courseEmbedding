                133The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

                681The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or “star rating”, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange–traded funds, closed–end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three–year history. Exchange–traded funds and open–ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk–Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product′s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three–, five–, and 10–year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three–year rating for 36–59 months of total returns, 60% five–year rating⁄40% three–year rating for 60–119 months of total returns, and 50% 10–year rating⁄30% five–year rating⁄20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Stylebox†

At Dimensional, our investment approach is based on a belief in markets.

Rather than relying on futile forecasting or trying to outguess others, we draw information about expected returns from the market itself—letting the collective knowledge of its millions of buyers and sellers set security prices.

Letting markets do what they do best—drive information into prices—frees us to spend time where we believe we have an advantage, namely in how we interpret the research, how we design and manage portfolios, and how we service our clients. It means we take a less subjective, more systematic approach to investing—an approach we can implement consistently and investors can understand and stick with, even in challenging market environments.

Only 18% of equity and fixed income funds that were around at the start of 2002 beat their Morningstar Category index, 15 years later.

 Breakthroughs in Modern Finance 








1966Efficient Market Hypothesis
 






Efficient Market Hypothesis
Eugene Fama
                  Nobel laureate, 2013
                  Professor, University of Chicago

Eugene Fama’s efficient market hypothesis marks a pivotal moment for modern finance. The essence of the argument can be described by the simple statement that security prices reflect all available information.









1973Intertemporal CAPM
 


 



Intertemporal CAPM
Robert Merton
                    Nobel laureate, 1997
                    Professor, MIT

The ICAPM set up a theoretical framework for how multiple sources of risk could arise. It expanded on the one-period CAPM model where the only priced risk was market beta.

Today
 


 












 Dimensional’s Research and Investment teams draw insight from academia, but what sets us apart is how we interpret, test, and apply that research to practical investment solutions for our clients. 




Tomorrow
...
 


 Dimensional was built around a set of ideas bigger than the firm itself. With a confidence in markets, deep connections to the academic community, and a focus on implementation, we go where the science leads, and continue to pursue new insights, both large and small, that can benefit our clients. 

















 Eugene Fama and Kenneth French are members of the Board of Directors for and provide consulting services to Dimensional Fund Advisors LP. Robert Merton and Robert Novy-Marx provide consulting services to Dimensional Fund Advisors LP. 


 








Dimensional’s investment approach is grounded in economic theory and backed by decades of empirical research.


Our internal team of researchers works closely with leading financial economists to better understand where returns come from.


Research has shown that securities that offer higher expected returns share certain characteristics, which we call dimensions. To be considered a dimension, these characteristics must be sensible, persistent over time, pervasive across markets, and cost-effective to capture.

                            “We’re very careful in looking at new research that comes along and making sure it’s robust.”

Understanding what drives returns is the starting point. From here, we focus on fine-tuning our method of capturing them.


We structure broadly diversified portfolios that emphasize the dimensions of higher expected returns, while addressing the tradeoffs that arise when executing portfolios.


Every day our portfolio managers and traders seek to balance costs against expected returns and diversification. We work for the slightest expected gain, as every incremental improvement can add up over time.

TO OUR CLIENTS









                The Global Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath 
            

                A key to a good long-term investment experience is being able to stay with your investment philosophy, even during tough times. During the rocky 2008–2012 period, many investors sold their equity funds. Dimensional’s equity funds had inflows throughout the period, which could suggest that in aggregate investors were prepared to withstand the market’s movements in order to pursue long-term results.

Industry net new cash flow data provided by Investment Company Institute© based on the approximately 4,600 US-domiciled equity (domestic and international) mutual funds reported on an aggregate level to the Investment Company Institute©. This includes information on Dimensional’s US-domiciled funds during this period. For illustrative purposes only.
        












Dimensional Investing is about providing a successful investment experience.


That means more than considering investment returns. It means offering peace of mind knowing that a transparent approach backed by decades of research is powering every decision.


Markets go up and they go down. The goal of Dimensional Investing is to help people be prepared, so they can stick with their plan.

Dimensional has a unique way of working with financial advisors. 


We want to build deep, working relationships with advisors who share our desire to pursue better financial outcomes for their clients. We believe that client-focused advice and efficient, value-added access to the capital markets can be a successful combination for both advisors and their clients. 

We have seen many advisors thrive with this approach by reorienting their business around the client experience. These firms focus on offering guidance to help investors think differently about investing, so they may pursue long-term goals without the daily worry.
