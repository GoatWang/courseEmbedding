Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreHow do you tackle this mess of home electronics? It’s time to get organized at home, with the smallest things getting resolved and tidied up first — in comes cord and cable management systems to save the day.Corral cords and cables. For cords and cables that are used infrequently or need to be easily portable, consider cable spools or corrals to keep them organized and accessible for the next time you need them. There is nothing worse than rummaging around for a digital camera connector just to see that it has been shoved to the back of your desk, now a tangled and knotted mess.Create your own charging station for bundling everyday electronics.Charging stations are great for bundling smaller and more portable home electronics like cell phones, iPods and other MP3 players or smart phones. Instead of spreading the devices and cords all over the house, create one central command charging station that can really take control of the clutter at its core.Use cable boxes to organize even the messiest of power strips.Power strips are a great way to get all of your cords and cables in one easy and accessible place, but the issue of managing countless tangled cables is still not resolved. Cable boxes can be a quick and painless solution. Simply pop the cover over the surge protector or power strip, and instantly conceal and protect the cords and plugs of your prized home electronics.Find a desk designed for cable management.These days, there are desks and desktops devoted to keeping you and your cables and workspace organized. Complete with USB hubs and AC adaptors, all electronic and technological requirements have slots and slats integrated right into the furniture. Technology and practicality are designed to a perfect union, and now, you can stop wasting time untangling your headphones and get back to work.

While the frame is often an afterthought to the art or photograph it’s encompassing, having a proper   picture frame is just as important as the piece itself. Good photo frames become a part of the arrangement, often enhancing the subject matter, so a poor choice in style or incorrect size can make your artwork stand out, and not in a good way. Here are some things to consider when you looking through various    picture frames for sale: More

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreWhat size   picture frame should I buy?As you pick your size, you need to decide whether or not you want to include a mat or not. Matting often helps your art or photo stand out, though it can also cut off the image if the   picture frame is not sized to accommodate it. Make sure you factor it in when making your purchase; if you opt to go without a mat, your photo or artwork should be the exact size of the interior opening of your   frame — you don’t want to have any of the unattractive cardboard backing showing, or have to trim any of the art itself. What style   photo frames should I look for?When it comes to style, think about what is going to be inside the   frame. Make sure the style of the art or photograph complements the style of the frame itself. Consider texture, colors and material. You want your   picture frame and artwork to work well together, so pick one that serves to enhance the art, not detract from its beauty. Try an option with minimal design details to make your art stand out, or try a bold   frame with a bit of interest to contrast the piece.

Your coffee table is the perfect spot to really make a literary, artistic or photographic statement. No matter the subject, coffee table books are a great way to share your love of Yves Saint Laurent, Annie Leibovitz, modern art or all things vintage. They can entertain guests while you whip up a quick concoction, or serve as an additional design element. More

Sell on Houzz - Learn MoreDon’t feel like your coffee table book selection is limited to famous artists and designers only. If you’re a huge antique car fanatic, look for books on that topic. If theater or history gets you excited, select some books on Shakespeare or notable historical figures like Winston Churchill. Vintage books can bring to mind nostalgic memories of family members, whereas photography books can remind you of places you’ve traveled to or dreamed of. Art books can range from modern to traditional, fashion to home décor and architecture. Whatever subject (or subjects) you choose, coffee tables are an easy way to add a meaningful layer of color and interest to your living room.

World Globes

 1,085 World Globes
Globes are a fantastic way to learn about the earth and its continents, countries and cities. An interactive globe is a great tool for teaching children about the diversity of our world. Even an old-fashioned spinning globe can be fun when you give it a spin, close your eyes and place your finger in a random location you’ll supposedly travel to or live in a few years down the line. You can also use a world globe map to show young learners where current events are taking place, or even find them easily yourself. More

Photo albums can also be decorative or customized, though usually to a lesser extent. Most, however, provide a layer of protection for your photos, which ensures you’ll have access to these captured moments for years to come.
