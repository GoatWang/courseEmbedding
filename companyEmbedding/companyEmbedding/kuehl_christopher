Meet Christopher Kuehl









Date

15
May. 2014



May 15th, 2014






Christopher Kuehl is a new partner at Mindbox Studios that is passionate about product design, entrepreneurship, and bold startups. In this interview you’ll hear more about his story, his views on technology, startups, and the Denver, CO scene.



 

Joshua Johnson is CEO of Mindbox Studios. Over the past 10 years he's helped launch over 100 companies with founders all over the country from dozens of industries. 

Joshua started his journey in the internet of things as a visual designer for web experiences, but it was the art of building great internet companies that attracted him to develop his career in technology.

He enjoys living as minimally as possible (with a family of 6), leather boots, and his BMW 650GS motorcycle. Joshua and his wife, Rebekah, have four beautiful daughters and live in Northern California–even though he still visits the Cincinnati and Eugene offices several times throughout the year.

About Us
Founded by Keith Prather and Chris Kuehl in January of 2001, Armada began as a competitive intelligence firm, grounded in the discipline of gathering, analyzing, and disseminating intelligence.  Today, Armada executives function as trusted strategic advisors to business executives, merging our fundamental roots in  corporate intelligence gathering, economic forecasting and strategy development.

Armada focuses on the market forces bearing down on organizations. We provide a pipeline for intelligence that is focused on helping senior executives quickly navigate through complex market situations to assess risk and growth opportunities.
To that end, we have developed a proprietary system of briefings for Senior Business Leaders called the Armada Executive Intelligence Briefing System.  It is comprised of 10 different types of intelligence briefings which collectively provide a complete view of the global macro marketplace for executives.
The briefings themselves are written in a manner that is direct and to the point and very similar in format to the daily written brief prepared for the President of the United States. Instituted in 1960 for President Kennedy, the President’s Daily Brief (PDB) is a tool that the nation’s Chief Executive uses to understand the dynamics of the world they face. Arguably, the briefings themselves are considered to be among the most top secret documents in the Federal Government. Our proprietary briefing system is patterned after the PDB – but designed for the Business Executive for use in understanding the  macro dynamics of the economy, environment, and the political decisions / events that will affect business decisions and add risk.  If an event doesn’t have an impact on business, we don’t write about it.
We also forecast where we think particular events are going – using a fact-based scenario testing methodology we have developed. Executives tell us that they may not always like what we have to report, but they always appreciate it.
Our vision is to create a closely-kept community of corporate executives from around the world sharing insights and intelligence on economics, emerging / growth markets, risks, and other elements critical to running a corporation in an environment that is respectful, professional, and as confidential as a member wants it to be.  We will start by priming the pump and downloading everything we know, can collect, and analyze about the global business environment in one of the ten different briefing elements.  Everything else is just value-added benefits of being a member.
As an offshoot of this system, we also prepare private briefings specifically for executives of corporations – focused on specific markets and elements of their business, competition, environment, and other dimensions that they self-select as being important to them. Designed as an “Officer of the Watch Report”, it is truly more like the PDB for a single executive than anything else on the market. For more about the “Officer of the Watch Report”, click here.

Christopher Kuhl

























































Welcome!I’m Christopher Kuhl, a poet, and I welcome you to my website. I hope you find it informative and interesting. Please visit my contact page if you would like to send me an e-mail, and you may also leave comments on my blog at the end of each individual post.
Let me tell you a little about myself. I was born in northern New York, although I now reside an hour (depending on the traffic) west of Chicago. I earned a B.A. in philosophy, and a B.Mus. in composition at SUNY Potsdam; an M.M. in composition, as well as an M.M. in music history at Bowling Green State University; and a Ph.D. in interdisciplinary arts at Ohio University.
I’ve been writing seriously as a poet since high school, learning my craft from my own efforts and the work of other poets; my mentor was the late Kay Kasberger. She would read my work and respond to it; but she never said, “This is good; this is terrible.” Rather, she would put a red asterisk by the things she liked and talk to me about why. Then she would leave me to revise, study, and write more. This was also the time of Simon and Garfunkel, whose work fascinated me: By studying their lyrics, I learned more about the craft of poetry—for that is truly what Simon’s work is: intelligent, thoughtful, wide-ranging, rich; truly poetry set to music. Kay encouraged me to study song lyrics since they appealed to me, and I did.
By the time I got to college, I was writing daily, learning and practicing my craft; this daily effort continues to this day. Prior to the middle of 2013, I published some poems but not very often. From the middle of 2013 to the present, I have been publishing, on average, one to two poems a month. The content and form of my poetry are wide-ranging, as are the journals that have taken them. For a list of my publishing credits, see my poetry page. You can also read some samples of my published works to gain a sense of who I am as a writer.
Finally, although writing is my life, my being…I have other interests as well. I read widely: poetry to literary fiction to history and philosophy; take art classes (dry media right now); study Hebrew; and work out regularly (I actually like it). And some of what I encounter in the world around me finds its way into my work. (I think that’s probably true of every writer.)
I hope you feel like you know me a little better now; I certainly look forward to meeting you.
Again, welcome to my website!

Thursday, October 20th at 7:00PM CST:
Christopher Kuhl will be the featured reader at the Culture Stock, located at 43 E Galena Blvd, Aurora, IL 60505
