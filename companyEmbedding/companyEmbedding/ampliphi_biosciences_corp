AmpliPhi Biosciences to Present at Bacteriophage Therapy Workshop Sponsored by the FDA and NIH | Business Wire
























































AmpliPhi Biosciences to Present at Bacteriophage Therapy Workshop 
      Sponsored by the FDA and NIH






July 05, 2017 06:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AmpliPhi 
      Biosciences Corporation (NYSE MKT: APHB), a global leader in the 
      development of therapies to treat drug-resistant infections using 
      bacteriophage-based technology, announces that it has been invited to 
      present at a workshop entitled “Bacteriophage Therapy: Scientific and 
      Regulatory Issues” being held July 10-11, 2017 in Rockville, MD. This 
      workshop is being organized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s 
      (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and the National 
      Institutes of Health’s (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and 
      Infectious Diseases. Further information on the workshop is available 
      from the FDA’s website, here.
    


      This public workshop is expected to bring together an international 
      group of government agencies, academia, industry and other stakeholders 
      involved in research, development and regulation of bacteriophages 
      intended for therapeutic use in humans. The aims of the workshop are to 
      discuss the scientific and regulatory considerations for bacteriophage 
      therapies and to provide a forum for the exchange of information and 
      perspectives, with the ultimate goal of facilitating development and 
      rigorous clinical assessment of bacteriophage therapy products. AmpliPhi 
      also participated in the NIH’s first workshop on bacteriophage therapy 
      in July 2015.
    

      AmpliPhi’s Senior Scientist Susan Lehman, Ph.D., will deliver a 
      presentation entitled “Getting from lab bench to clinic: CMC and 
      practical considerations for phage products” on July 10, 2017, as part 
      of an afternoon session focused on the principal regulatory issues 
      affecting the development of bacteriophage therapy. Dr. Lehman’s 
      presentation will be available following the workshop under the 
      company’s Events 
      & Presentation page.
    

About Bacteriophages


      Bacteriophages, or more simply “phages,” are the natural predators of 
      bacteria and are thought to be the most abundant life form on earth. 
      Phages have evolved an incredible diversity of strains that typically 
      prey upon just a few closely related strains or species of bacteria, 
      enabling phage therapies to precisely target pathogenic bacteria while 
      sparing the beneficial microbiota. Phages can infect and kill bacteria, 
      whether they are antibiotic-resistant or not, and even when they have 
      formed protective biofilms.
    

About AmpliPhi Biosciences


      AmpliPhi Biosciences Corporation is a biotechnology company pioneering 
      the development of therapies for antibiotic-resistant infections using 
      bacteriophage-based technology. In May 2017, AmpliPhi announced an 
      additional near-term strategic emphasis on developing precisely targeted 
      and personalized bacteriophage therapies for patients with serious or 
      life-threatening antibiotic-resistant infections. AmpliPhi has reported 
      results from two Phase 1 clinical trials of AB-SA01, one for the 
      treatment of Staphylococcus aureus in patients with chronic 
      rhinosinusitis (safety and preliminary efficacy) and one to evaluate the 
      safety of AB-SA01 when administered topically to the intact skin of 
      healthy adults. AmpliPhi has additional bacteriophage-based preclinical 
      products in development, including for the treatment of Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa infections. AmpliPhi has received positive feedback from 
      the FDA and UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
      Agency (MHRA) on its development plans.
    

      In May 2017, AmpliPhi announced the completion of an underwritten public 
      offering of common stock and common warrants resulting in net proceeds 
      to AmpliPhi of approximately $9.1 million.

	Dear Vitacost.com Customer:
We regret to inform you that Burt’s Bees, which is owned by parent company Clorox, has decided to stop selling their products through Vitacost.com. Neither Clorox nor Burt’s Bees offered an explanation for this change, other than saying that selling through our website is not “consistent” with their current strategy.
	We find it unfortunate that you will no longer be able to benefit from the convenience of online delivery of this product, as well as Vitacost.com’s competitive pricing.

New Chapter Combines Nature’s Wisdom & Science for Supplements You Can Trust

If you’re familiar with New Chapter, the Vermont-based vitamin and supplement company that was founded in 1982, you probably know their remarkable dedication to sourcing the best ingredients for health in environmentally responsible ways.
New Chapter believes the best way to deliver the healing wisdom of nature is through effective, high-quality products that acknowledge not only the latest science, but are also inspired by time-tested herbal tradition. New Chapter has vowed to only introduce products that will make meaningful contributions-products that are new chapters for holistic health.
Inspired by nature, validated by science
New Chapter’s uncompromising dedication to quality and Mother Earth goes all the way back to their roots. New Chapter® was founded in 1982 by Paul and Barbi Schulick out of a desire to bring the remarkable value of nature’s botanicals into people’s lives. From the beginning, Paul and Barbi made a firm commitment to utilizing each whole plant in its pure, unadulterated form.
Nature, in its wholeness, offers a profound opportunity for supporting well-being!
What sets New Chapter apart
Sourcing the ideal ingredients is key in the production of New Chapter supplements. The company travels the globe for herbs, vegetables, mushrooms and fruits that meet strict standards for purity, potency and especially sustainable sourcing. And these ingredients are bursting with nourishment-organic turmeric from India in Turmeric Force™, wild-caught salmon from Alaska’s clean waters in Wholemega™, 10 potent herbs in clinically studied Zyflamend™ Whole Body and sustainably harvested plant calcium from Iceland in Bone Strength Take Care™. 
New Chapter is also a fermentation pioneer. In 1986 they began creating fermented multivitamins that are easily digestible and gentle on the stomach. Their proven, two-step fermentation method uses the power of clinically studied probiotics to bring vitality to each nutrient and unlock its health benefits. Fermentation creates a nutritious fermentate and unleashes Nature’s immune-boosters called beta glucans. Today, New Chapter makes holistic multivitamins for every stage of life, including prenatal and postnatal support.
 Plus New Chapter became a Certified B Corporation in 2014. B Corps are a vibrant new kind of business that define success not just in terms of profit, but in terms of people and planet.
Discover the New Chapter difference
Just as you might check foods for organic and non-GMO labeling, you can confirm the credentials of New Chapter vitamins and supplements the same way. New Chapter multivitamins are made with third-party certified organic vegetables and herbs, and they’re verified by the Non-GMO Project. You can find the Non-GMO Project Verified seal on Zyflamend™ Whole Body, on all New Chapter herbals and herbal blends, on LifeShield™ mushrooms and on their plant calcium, too.
Paul and Barbi’s mission today remains still the same: to deliver the wisdom of nature to all those seeking natural wellness. Check out New Chapter’s whole family of products and experience your own new chapter in holistic health!
