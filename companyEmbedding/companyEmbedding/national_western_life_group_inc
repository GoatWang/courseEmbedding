Annuity Basics
In today’s world, an annuity a popular tool used by consumers to protect their savings and plan for retirement.
When considering whether to purchase an annuity, it’s important to understand how the value of the annuity is determined, 
                                        the liquidity options available to you, as well as any tax benefits or implications of placing retirement savings in an annuity. 
                                        Before you decide to purchase an annuity, ask yourself the following questions:
“How much annuity income will I need and for how long?”
“When will I need access to the funds?”
“Do I have an emergency fund set aside to meet my other obligations?”
What is an annuity?
    An annuity is a financial product that accumulates interest on a tax-deferred basis. 
                                         An annuity is typically used for saving for a long term goal – such as retirement – and is not appropriate for short-term purposes. An annuity is not an investment product or a savings account. 
                                         It is designed to provide systematic payouts over a period of time based on various retirement or other planned income schedules. 
                                        Much of the attractiveness of annuities is due to the favorable tax treatment. 
                                        Unlike interest on savings accounts and dividends from stocks and mutual funds which are taxable in the year earned, interest credited on a deferred annuity is not taxed until funds are withdrawn.
                                    
 Types of Annuities
    Annuity contracts can vary in a number of ways. Described below are some of the ways annuities differ and are commonly categorized.
                                    
When benefits are received
  Annuities may be either immediate or deferred. Immediate annuities provide income payments that start shortly after you pay the premium, typically within a year. Deferred annuities provide income payments that start at a later date. The primary reason for buying an immediate annuity is to obtain an immediate income, frequently during retirement, for those who want to receive a set amount on a recurring basis. In contrast, a deferred annuity accumulates money on a tax-deferred basis until it is eventually dispersed, either as a lump sum or as a series of recurring payments at a later date.
                                    
How premiums are paid
Annuities may be either single premium or flexible premium. Single premium annuity contracts allow only a one- time premium payment to the Company for deposit into your annuity.
                                         Flexible premium annuity contracts are designed to allow multiple premium payments-you pay as much as you wish whenever you wish, within specified Company limits (varies by product).
How interest is credited
Annuities are also categorized by how interest is credited, referred to as either "fixed" or "variable".
                                          Fixed annuities have a guaranteed rate of interest for a specified term, providing predictable future contract value. 
                                        Another type of fixed annuity is a fixed indexed annuity, which provides the option of having interest accumulation based on a formula that is linked in part to growth in the equity market as measured by an index such as the S&P 500®. 
                                         Subject to fixed minimum guarantees, the value of a fixed indexed annuity will never decline due to index movement alone. 
                                         Conversely, variable annuities offer a variety of investment options, typically mutual funds. 
                                         The value and growth of the variable annuity is dependent on the performance (whether positive or negative) of the underlying investments. 
                                         National Western Life does not offer variable annuities.

Benefits
National Western Life Insurance Company offers a competitive benefit package to its employees and their families. The goal of our benefits plan is to offer financial protection in the event of illness or injury, provide a means for building a retirement income, and allow reasonable time off. The following is just an overview. New employees become eligible for most benefits on the first day of the month following 60 days of employment.
Health and Welfare: National Western Life offers 2 different medical plans through United Healthcare - a traditional PPO plan with deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance; and a high-deductible health plan with a health savings account (HSA) feature. The HSA plan is designed for lower premiums that still offer protection in case of a serious illness or injury. Prescription drugs are included with either plan. National Western Life subsidizes the cost of both medical plans. Group dental and vision plans are also offered as voluntary elections. Company provides you with life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) policies of 1.5x your annual base salary, which you can supplement with additional voluntary life. By enrolling in voluntary life/AD&D, you can also elect voluntary coverage for your spouse and/or children. Short-term and Long-term Disability plans are provided as well at no cost to you. LTD eligibility begins one year after your hire date.
Wellness: National Western Life provides employees the resources to manage their own health and wellness routine. Through various programs, employees gain knowledge and increase their ability to prevent disease and manage their health. Some examples are: weight watchers, gym membership discounts with payroll deductions, free on-site aerobic classes, lunch and learn sessions and friendly competitions that include great prizes!
Retirement: As with many companies today, National Western Life has a 401(k) savings plan designed to help you put away money through tax deferred payroll deductions. Enrollment is automatic with the default deferral election starting at 3%. You of course may change your elective deferral rate or opt out of the plan altogether. In addition to your contributions, National Western Life will match your deposit dollar for dollar up to 3% each pay period.
Flex Time: National Western Life believes in the work/life balance. Therefore, our weekly schedule is 37.50 hours instead of the regular 40 hours. This allows employees the flexibility of make-up time, shorter/longer lunch breaks and the ability to miss some of the rush hour traffic.
Time Off:  All new employees will be credited from 2-10 sick days, depending on the time of year, for use during the rest of the calendar year. Each January, all employees are credited with 10 sick days and 2 personal days. After 6 months, you will then earn 5 vacation days and another 5 days after 1 year. Each year thereafter on your anniversary date, you will be credited with additional vacation days based on years of service.
National Western Life Credit Union: All new employees are eligible for membership to our very own on-site credit union. The credit union is a convenient way to save and borrow money right where you work! Take advantage of some of the benefits such as competitive interest rates and loan protection insurance. Discount movie and theme park tickets are also available. 

This is just an overview of the benefit program at NWL. Other services include a flexible spending account plan, voluntary cancer plan, discounted National Western Life products, tuition reimbursement and on-site check cashing. For more details, please ask your HR recruiter for National Western Life.

Life Insurance Basics
Life insurance is the first step in protecting your loved ones in the event of an untimely death.  Life insurance can provide an income tax-free death benefit to help secure your family’s financial security.
When purchasing life insurance, there are two basic initial questions to consider:

"What kind of life insurance do I need?"
                                            "How much life insurance do I need?"

Types of Life Insurance 
Most life insurance products can be categorized into two basic groups: term insurance and permanent insurance.  You should purchase life insurance that is based on your specific needs and fits within your budget. 
What is term insurance?
Term insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time -- normally in increments of 10, 15, 20 or even 30 years.  Term insurance is generally less expensive than permanent insurance because most term policies do not contain a cash value component. With term insurance, you pay premiums only for as long as you need insurance coverage.
What is permanent insurance?
Permanent insurance provides coverage for the lifetime of the insured.  Generally, permanent insurance is more expensive than term insurance because of the accumulation of cash value within the policy.  Cash value accumulation growth is determined by the type of permanent insurance policy purchased.  Some of the most common types of permanent insurance include whole life insurance, universal life insurance, and indexed universal life insurance.  An important benefit to cash value policies is that the cash value account grows tax-deferred and may be withdrawn or borrowed from the policy*.
How much life insurance do I need? 
Each family or business has different needs at the time of a death. While there are several ways of saving for this contingency, life insurance may be the best solution for covering long-term financial needs.  Life insurance proceeds may help pay for final expenses or burial costs, replace income, provide a college fund, pay outstanding bills, cover business expenses, or even pay for estate taxes (if applicable). 
Applying for Life Insurance
Following the receipt of a life insurance application, most life insurance companies conduct a brief evaluation of the applicant through a process known in the industry as underwriting.  National Western Life offers products with both traditional underwriting and simplified underwriting. 
Traditional underwriting typically has several requirements including completion of a physical examination by a medical professional. Generally, traditional underwriting is more in depth and may take several weeks to complete.   
By contrast, simplified underwriting is based upon the insured’s answers to certain medical questions and shared medical information via the MIB (Medical Information Bureau).  Simplified underwriting is designed to take less time than traditional underwriting – perfectly suited for today’s fast paced world.  
National Western Life Insurance does not market or solicit life insurance in the state of New York.
*Cash value accumulation may incur additional tax consequences under certain circumstances. Please consult your own tax, accounting, or legal professional before making any decisions. Any outstanding loans or withdrawals may be subtracted from the death benefit.

About the Company
National Western Life Insurance Company is chartered by the State of Colorado and a wholly owned subsidiary of National Western Life Group, Inc. National Western’s domestic operations extend to forty-nine states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. territories. The Company is also licensed in Haiti and accepts applications at its Home Office in Austin, Texas from – and issues policies to – non-U.S. residents. National Western operations extend globally to domestic and foreign markets.  Our mission is to provide high quality insurance products on a global basis to meet the financial security needs of well-defined market segments. We provide professional and friendly service to our policyholders and agents and are responsive to the needs of our employees, shareholders and the community.

Independent Ratings of NWL
Most life insurance companies obtain one or more ratings from various independent rating agencies. These ratings help policyholders, agents, investors, and others evaluate the financial strength and stability of insurance companies.
National Western's ratings are:

 "A" (Excellent) by A.M. Best, and
 "A" (Strong) by Standard & Poor's.

	A.M. Best's ratings are based on specific factors related to the  overall performance of an insurance company.  An A.M. Best rating is indicative of the Company's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. Ratings range from A++ (superior) to F (in liquidation). The "A" rating identifies companies which have, on average, demonstrated excellent financial strength, operating performance, and market profile when compared to the industry standards established by A.M. Best. In the opinion of A.M. Best, an “A” – rated company has a strong ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders.
	Standard & Poor's ratings are an opinion of the financial security characteristics of an insurance organization with respect to its ability to pay out its insurance policies and contracts in accordance with their terms. Ratings range from “AAA” (extremely strong), to “CC” (extremely weak), and “R” (regulatory action regarding solvency).

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
