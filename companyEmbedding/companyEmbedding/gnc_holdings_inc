History[edit]




A GNC store at Promenade


In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small health food store, Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He only made USD $35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the Ohio River flooded on St. Patrick's Day. Both of his stores were wiped out. However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941. The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII. During the health food craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to General Nutrition Center. He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE)in the 1980s. Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC. The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death. The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold. In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.[3] GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s. Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and Numico acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to Apollo Management in 2003. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Ares Management bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.
Retail stores[edit]




GNC store, Ypsilanti Twp., MI


GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.
GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 store-within-a-store locations within Rite Aid, as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.
Business model[edit]
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and franchised stores; 950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban shopping malls and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on drugstore.com.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.[4] An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.[5] The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for. The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.[6]
In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients picamilon and BMPEA, which are banned by the FDA.[7][8][9]
On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.[10][11][12]

History[edit]




A GNC store at Promenade


In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small health food store, Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He only made USD $35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the Ohio River flooded on St. Patrick's Day. Both of his stores were wiped out. However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941. The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII. During the health food craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to General Nutrition Center. He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE)in the 1980s. Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC. The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death. The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold. In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.[3] GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s. Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and Numico acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to Apollo Management in 2003. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Ares Management bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.
Retail stores[edit]




GNC store, Ypsilanti Twp., MI


GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.
GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 store-within-a-store locations within Rite Aid, as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.
Business model[edit]
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and franchised stores; 950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban shopping malls and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on drugstore.com.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.[4] An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.[5] The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for. The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.[6]
In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients picamilon and BMPEA, which are banned by the FDA.[7][8][9]
On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.[10][11][12]

History[edit]




A GNC store at Promenade


In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small health food store, Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He only made USD $35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the Ohio River flooded on St. Patrick's Day. Both of his stores were wiped out. However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941. The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII. During the health food craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to General Nutrition Center. He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE)in the 1980s. Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC. The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death. The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold. In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.[3] GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s. Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and Numico acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to Apollo Management in 2003. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Ares Management bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.
Retail stores[edit]




GNC store, Ypsilanti Twp., MI


GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.
GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 store-within-a-store locations within Rite Aid, as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.
Business model[edit]
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and franchised stores; 950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban shopping malls and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on drugstore.com.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.[4] An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.[5] The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for. The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.[6]
In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients picamilon and BMPEA, which are banned by the FDA.[7][8][9]
On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.[10][11][12]

History[edit]




A GNC store at Promenade


In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small health food store, Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh. He only made USD $35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the Ohio River flooded on St. Patrick's Day. Both of his stores were wiped out. However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941. The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII. During the health food craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to General Nutrition Center. He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE)in the 1980s. Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC. The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death. The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold. In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in Downtown Pittsburgh.[3] GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s. Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and Numico acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to Apollo Management in 2003. Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Ares Management bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.
Retail stores[edit]




GNC store, Ypsilanti Twp., MI


GNC stores typically stock a wide range of weight loss, bodybuilding, nutritional supplements, vitamins, natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.
GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 store-within-a-store locations within Rite Aid, as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.
Business model[edit]
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and franchised stores; 950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban shopping malls and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on drugstore.com.
Lawsuits[edit]
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.[4] An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.[5] The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for. The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.[6]
In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients picamilon and BMPEA, which are banned by the FDA.[7][8][9]
On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the Fox Broadcasting Company for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during Super Bowl LI. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the National Football League because of GNC's placement on an NFLPA blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.[10][11][12]

PITTSBURGH, July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- GNC Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:    GNC) (the "Company") reported consolidated revenue of $641.0 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared with consolidated revenue of $673.2 million for the second quarter of 2016. 
Same store sales decreased 0.9% in domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) in the second quarter of 2017. In domestic franchise locations, same store sales decreased 1.1%. 








For the second quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $15.7 million compared with $64.0 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was $0.23 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $0.94 in the prior year quarter. Excluding non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges in the current quarter and gains on refranchising in the prior year quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.41 and $0.79 in the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
"We made good progress in the second quarter, and our investments in pricing, loyalty and improving the customer experience continued to deliver positive results," said interim CEO, Bob Moran. "For the second quarter in a row, we saw meaningful transaction growth, improvement in our dot.com business and increased enrollment in our loyalty programs. We believe this business is headed in the right direction, and we remain focused on execution and sales growth."
Update on One New GNC

Transaction growth continued in the second quarter, up 12.3%, resulting in sequential quarterly improvement in same store sales. 
As of the end of the second quarter of 2017, 7.3 million consumers had joined the myGNC Rewards Program and there were approximately 237,000 PRO Access members. 
As an element of the Company's omnichannel strategy, early in 2017, the Company launched a GNC storefront on Amazon which continues to exceed the Company's expectations. 

Long-Lived Asset Impairments
During the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets associated with its Lucky Vitamin e-commerce business totaling $19.4 million. Combined with the related tax benefit of $7.2 million, the resulting net after tax impact was $12.2 million, a reduction of $0.18 per diluted share in the current quarter.
Segment Operating Performance
U.S. & Canada
Revenues in the U.S. and Canada segment decreased $27.5 million, or 4.8%, to $543.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $570.9 million in the prior year quarter. E-commerce sales were approximately 9.5% of U.S. and Canada revenue in each of the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in revenue compared with the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $15.1 million decrease associated with the discontinuation of the Gold Card Member Pricing program in domestic corporate and franchise stores and the introduction of the Company's new loyalty programs and a decrease of $6.3 million due to the timing of shipments from our annual franchise conference, which occurred later in June compared with the prior year quarter.  In addition, the impact of negative same store sales for company-owned stores, GNC.com, franchise locations and Canada contributed to the decrease in revenue in the current quarter.
Operating income decreased $72.0 million to $32.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $104.5 million for the same period in 2016. Excluding the non-cash impairment charges of $19.4 million in the current quarter described above and gains on refranchising in the prior year quarter of $16.9 million, operating income was $51.9 million in the current quarter or 9.5% of segment revenue compared with $87.7 million in the prior year quarter or 15.4% of segment revenue. The decrease compared with the prior year quarter was primarily due to lower domestic retail product margin rate resulting from the impact of pricing and loyalty program changes associated with the One New GNC, the latter of which includes the impact of the discontinuation of the Gold Card Member Pricing program in the U.S., partially offset by higher vendor funding. Also contributing to the decrease was higher marketing expense of $4.2 million related to incremental online advertising, higher salaries and benefits of $5.2 million and expense deleverage associated with negative same store sales.
International
Revenues in the International segment increased $0.5 million, or 1.3%, to $43.6 million in the current quarter compared with $43.1 million in the prior year quarter. Revenues from the China business increased by $3.6 million in the current quarter compared with the prior year quarter, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from international franchisees of $3.1 million.  The decrease in revenue from international franchisees in the current quarter was primarily due to the impact of a decrease in retail same store sales of 1.9% and $4.0 million of sales recognized in the prior year quarter associated with the timing of shipments resulting from the annual franchise conference. 
Operating income increased $2.0 million, or 14.3%, to $15.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $13.6 million in the prior year quarter. Operating income was 35.8% of segment revenue in the current quarter compared with 31.7% in the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income rate was due to an increase in product margin rate primarily associated with a higher mix of proprietary sales as well as the comparative effect of a bad debt allowance associated with a franchisee that was recorded in the prior year quarter.
Manufacturing / Wholesale
Revenues in the Manufacturing / Wholesale segment, excluding intersegment sales, decreased $5.3 million, or 8.9%, to $53.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $59.2 million in the prior year quarter. Third-party contract manufacturing sales decreased $1.0 million, or 3.0%, to $32.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $33.7 million in the prior year quarter. Sales to wholesale partners decreased $4.3 million, or 16.6% from $25.5 million in the prior year quarter to $21.2 million in the current quarter. Intersegment sales decreased $0.6 million from $56.6 million in the prior year quarter to $56.0 million in the current quarter. 
Operating income was $17.9 million in each of the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and as a percentage of segment revenue was 16.3% and 15.5%, respectively. 
Year-to-Date Performance
For the first six months of 2017, the Company reported consolidated revenue of $1,285.8 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared with consolidated revenue of $1,342.1 million for the first six months of 2016. Revenue in the U.S. & Canada segment decreased 4.3%, revenue in the International segment increased 3.9%, and revenue in the Manufacturing / Wholesale segment decreased 8.8%, excluding intersegment sales. 
For the first six months of 2017, the Company reported net income of $39.5 million, compared with net income of $114.8 million for the first six months of 2016. EPS was $0.58 for the first six months of 2017, compared with $1.62 in the first six months of 2016. Excluding long-lived asset impairment charges and a legal charge in the current year period and gains on refranchising in the current and prior year periods, adjusted EPS was $0.77 in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $1.48 in the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Operating Metrics
As of June 30, 2017, the Company had 3,506 corporate stores in the U.S. and Canada, 1,138 domestic franchise locations, 2,378 Rite Aid franchise store-within-a-store locations and 1,946 international locations. The Company now has 8,968 store locations worldwide. 
For the first six months of 2017, the Company generated net cash from operating activities of $72.9 million and invested $20.4 million in capital expenditures. The Company generated free cash flow of $54.2 million (which it defines as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities excluding acquisitions except for store acquisitions). As of June 30, 2017, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were $52.0 million, long-term debt was $1.5 billion and the Company had $163.1 million available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

Forward-Looking Statements Involving Known and Unknown Risks and Uncertainties
This release contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the Company's financial condition, results of operations and business that is not historical information. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as "subject to," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends," "estimates," "projects," "may," "will," "should," "can," the negatives thereof, variations thereon and similar expressions, or by discussions regarding dividend, share repurchase plan, strategy and outlook. While GNC believes there is a reasonable basis for its expectations and beliefs, they are inherently uncertain. The Company may not realize its expectations and its beliefs may not prove correct. Many factors could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements, including but not limited to unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the Company's products; costs of compliance and any failure on management's part to comply with new and existing governmental regulations governing our products; limitations of or disruptions in the manufacturing system or losses of manufacturing certifications; disruptions in the distribution network; or failure to successfully execute the Company's growth strategy, including any inability to expand franchise operations or attract new franchisees, any inability to expand company-owned retail operations, any inability to grow the international footprint, any inability to expand the e-commerce businesses, or any inability to successfully integrate businesses that are acquired.

Same store sales for company-owned stores include point-of-sale retail sales from all domestic stores which have been operating for twelve full months following the opening period. The Company is an omnichannel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store and through e-commerce channels which include its wholly-owned website GNC.com and third party websites (the sales from which are included in the GNC.com business unit) where product assortment and price are controlled by the Company, in which purchases are fulfilled by direct shipment to the customer from one of the Company's distribution facilities as well as third party e-commerce vendors. In-store sales are reduced by sales originally consummated online or through mobile devices and subsequently returned in-store. Sales of membership programs, including the new PRO Access loyalty program and former Gold Card program, which is no longer offered in the U.S., as well as the net change in the deferred points liability associated with the myGNC Rewards program, are excluded from same store sales.
Same store sales are calculated on a daily basis for each store and exclude the net sales of a store for any period if the store was not open during the same period of the prior year. When a store's square footage has been changed as a result of reconfiguration or relocation in the same mall or shopping center, the store continues to be treated as a same store. If, during the period presented, a store was closed, relocated to a different mall or shopping center, or converted to a franchise store or a company-owned store, sales from that store up to and including the closing day or the day immediately preceding the relocation or conversion are included as same store sales as long as the store was open during the same period of the prior year. Corporate stores are included in same store sales after the thirteenth month following a relocation or conversion to a company-owned stores.
The Company also provides retail comparable same stores sales of its franchisees as well as its Canada business if meaningful to current results. While retail sales of franchisees are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements, the metric serves as a key performance indicator for its franchisees, which ultimately impacts wholesale sales and royalties and fees received from franchisees. The Company computes same store sales for its franchisees and Canada business consistent with the description of corporate same store sales above. Same store sales for international franchisees and Canada exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate changes relative to the U.S. dollar.
Management has included non-GAAP financial measures in this press release because it believes they represent an effective supplemental means by which to measure the Company's operating performance. Management believes that net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude impairment charges on long-lived assets, gains on refranchising and certain other expenses as reflected in this release, and free cash flow are useful to investors as they enable the Company and its investors to evaluate and compare the Company's results from operations in a more meaningful and consistent manner by excluding specific items which are not reflective of ongoing operating results. However, these measures are not measurements of the Company's performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to earnings per share, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to GAAP cash flow from operating activities, or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity.  For more information, see the attached reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.

(GNC) (the "Company") reported consolidated revenue of $641.0 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared with consolidated revenue of $673.2 million for the second quarter of 2016.GNC Logo. (PRNewsFoto/GNC Holdings, Inc.)MoreSame store sales decreased 0.9% in domestic company-owned stores (including GNC.com sales) in the second quarter of 2017. In domestic franchise locations, same store sales decreased 1.1%.For the second quarter of 2017, the Company reported net income of $15.7 million compared with $64.0 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share ("EPS") was $0.23 for the second quarter of 2017 compared with $0.94 in the prior year quarter. Excluding non-cash long-lived asset impairment charges in the current quarter and gains on refranchising in the prior year quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.41 and $0.79 in the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively."We made good progress in the second quarter, and our investments in pricing, loyalty and improving the customer experience continued to deliver positive results," said interim CEO, Bob Moran. "For the second quarter in a row, we saw meaningful transaction growth, improvement in our dot.com business and increased enrollment in our loyalty programs. We believe this business is headed in the right direction, and we remain focused on execution and sales growth."Update on One New GNCTransaction growth continued in the second quarter, up 12.3%, resulting in sequential quarterly improvement in same store sales. As of the end of the second quarter of 2017, 7.3 million consumers had joined the myGNC Rewards Program and there were approximately 237,000 PRO Access members. As an element of the Company's omnichannel strategy, early in 2017, the Company launched a GNC storefront on Amazon which continues to exceed the Company's expectations. Long-Lived Asset ImpairmentsDuring the quarter, the Company recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets associated with its Lucky Vitamin e-commerce business totaling $19.4 million. Combined with the related tax benefit of $7.2 million, the resulting net after tax impact was $12.2 million, a reduction of $0.18 per diluted share in the current quarter.Segment Operating PerformanceU.S. & CanadaRevenues in the U.S. and Canada segment decreased $27.5 million, or 4.8%, to $543.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $570.9 million in the prior year quarter. E-commerce sales were approximately 9.5% of U.S. and Canada revenue in each of the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in revenue compared with the prior year quarter was primarily due to a $15.1 million decrease associated with the discontinuation of the Gold Card Member Pricing program in domestic corporate and franchise stores and the introduction of the Company's new loyalty programs and a decrease of $6.3 million due to the timing of shipments from our annual franchise conference, which occurred later in June compared with the prior year quarter.  In addition, the impact of negative same store sales for company-owned stores, GNC.com, franchise locations and Canada contributed to the decrease in revenue in the current quarter.Operating income decreased $72.0 million to $32.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $104.5 million for the same period in 2016. Excluding the non-cash impairment charges of $19.4 million in the current quarter described above and gains on refranchising in the prior year quarter of $16.9 million, operating income was $51.9 million in the current quarter or 9.5% of segment revenue compared with $87.7 million in the prior year quarter or 15.4% of segment revenue. The decrease compared with the prior year quarter was primarily due to lower domestic retail product margin rate resulting from the impact of pricing and loyalty program changes associated with the One New GNC, the latter of which includes the impact of the discontinuation of the Gold Card Member Pricing program in the U.S., partially offset by higher vendor funding. Also contributing to the decrease was higher marketing expense of $4.2 million related to incremental online advertising, higher salaries and benefits of $5.2 million and expense deleverage associated with negative same store sales.Read MoreInternationalRevenues in the International segment increased $0.5 million, or 1.3%, to $43.6 million in the current quarter compared with $43.1 million in the prior year quarter. Revenues from the China business increased by $3.6 million in the current quarter compared with the prior year quarter, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from international franchisees of $3.1 million.  The decrease in revenue from international franchisees in the current quarter was primarily due to the impact of a decrease in retail same store sales of 1.9% and $4.0 million of sales recognized in the prior year quarter associated with the timing of shipments resulting from the annual franchise conference.Operating income increased $2.0 million, or 14.3%, to $15.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $13.6 million in the prior year quarter. Operating income was 35.8% of segment revenue in the current quarter compared with 31.7% in the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income rate was due to an increase in product margin rate primarily associated with a higher mix of proprietary sales as well as the comparative effect of a bad debt allowance associated with a franchisee that was recorded in the prior year quarter.Manufacturing / WholesaleRevenues in the Manufacturing / Wholesale segment, excluding intersegment sales, decreased $5.3 million, or 8.9%, to $53.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $59.2 million in the prior year quarter. Third-party contract manufacturing sales decreased $1.0 million, or 3.0%, to $32.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $33.7 million in the prior year quarter. Sales to wholesale partners decreased $4.3 million, or 16.6% from $25.5 million in the prior year quarter to $21.2 million in the current quarter. Intersegment sales decreased $0.6 million from $56.6 million in the prior year quarter to $56.0 million in the current quarter.Operating income was $17.9 million in each of the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and as a percentage of segment revenue was 16.3% and 15.5%, respectively.Year-to-Date PerformanceFor the first six months of 2017, the Company reported consolidated revenue of $1,285.8 million, a decrease of 4.2% compared with consolidated revenue of $1,342.1 million for the first six months of 2016. Revenue in the U.S. & Canada segment decreased 4.3%, revenue in the International segment increased 3.9%, and revenue in the Manufacturing / Wholesale segment decreased 8.8%, excluding intersegment sales.For the first six months of 2017, the Company reported net income of $39.5 million, compared with net income of $114.8 million for the first six months of 2016. EPS was $0.58 for the first six months of 2017, compared with $1.62 in the first six months of 2016. Excluding long-lived asset impairment charges and a legal charge in the current year period and gains on refranchising in the current and prior year periods, adjusted EPS was $0.77 in the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared with $1.48 in the six months ended June 30, 2016.Operating MetricsAs of June 30, 2017, the Company had 3,506 corporate stores in the U.S. and Canada, 1,138 domestic franchise locations, 2,378 Rite Aid franchise store-within-a-store locations and 1,946 international locations.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as "subject to," "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "intends," "estimates," "projects," "may," "will," "should," "can," the negatives thereof, variations thereon and similar expressions, or by discussions regarding dividend, share repurchase plan, strategy and outlook. While GNC believes there is a reasonable basis for its expectations and beliefs, they are inherently uncertain. The Company may not realize its expectations and its beliefs may not prove correct. Many factors could affect future performance and cause actual results to differ materially from those matters expressed in or implied by forward-looking statements, including but not limited to unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the Company's products; costs of compliance and any failure on management's part to comply with new and existing governmental regulations governing our products; limitations of or disruptions in the manufacturing system or losses of manufacturing certifications; disruptions in the distribution network; or failure to successfully execute the Company's growth strategy, including any inability to expand franchise operations or attract new franchisees, any inability to expand company-owned retail operations, any inability to grow the international footprint, any inability to expand the e-commerce businesses, or any inability to successfully integrate businesses that are acquired. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Actual results could differ materially from those described or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a listing of factors that may materially affect such forward-looking statements, please refer to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.Same store sales for company-owned stores include point-of-sale retail sales from all domestic stores which have been operating for twelve full months following the opening period. The Company is an omnichannel retailer with capabilities that allow a customer to use more than one channel when making a purchase, including in-store and through e-commerce channels which include its wholly-owned website GNC.com and third party websites (the sales from which are included in the GNC.com business unit) where product assortment and price are controlled by the Company, in which purchases are fulfilled by direct shipment to the customer from one of the Company's distribution facilities as well as third party e-commerce vendors. In-store sales are reduced by sales originally consummated online or through mobile devices and subsequently returned in-store. Sales of membership programs, including the new PRO Access loyalty program and former Gold Card program, which is no longer offered in the U.S., as well as the net change in the deferred points liability associated with the myGNC Rewards program, are excluded from same store sales.Same store sales are calculated on a daily basis for each store and exclude the net sales of a store for any period if the store was not open during the same period of the prior year. When a store's square footage has been changed as a result of reconfiguration or relocation in the same mall or shopping center, the store continues to be treated as a same store. If, during the period presented, a store was closed, relocated to a different mall or shopping center, or converted to a franchise store or a company-owned store, sales from that store up to and including the closing day or the day immediately preceding the relocation or conversion are included as same store sales as long as the store was open during the same period of the prior year. Corporate stores are included in same store sales after the thirteenth month following a relocation or conversion to a company-owned stores.The Company also provides retail comparable same stores sales of its franchisees as well as its Canada business if meaningful to current results. While retail sales of franchisees are not included in the Company's consolidated financial statements, the metric serves as a key performance indicator for its franchisees, which ultimately impacts wholesale sales and royalties and fees received from franchisees. The Company computes same store sales for its franchisees and Canada business consistent with the description of corporate same store sales above. Same store sales for international franchisees and Canada exclude the impact of foreign exchange rate changes relative to the U.S. dollar.Management has included non-GAAP financial measures in this press release because it believes they represent an effective supplemental means by which to measure the Company's operating performance. Management believes that net income and earnings per share, adjusted to exclude impairment charges on long-lived assets, gains on refranchising and certain other expenses as reflected in this release, and free cash flow are useful to investors as they enable the Company and its investors to evaluate and compare the Company's results from operations in a more meaningful and consistent manner by excluding specific items which are not reflective of ongoing operating results. However, these measures are not measurements of the Company's performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to earnings per share, net income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as an alternative to GAAP cash flow from operating activities, or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity.  For more information, see the attached reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.   GNC HOLDINGS, INC.

Style Scores:



A Value | A Growth | D Momentum | A VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
