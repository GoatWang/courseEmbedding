Summaries from the California Bar Journal are based on discipline orders but are not the official records. Not all discipline actions have associated CBJ summaries. Copies of official attorney discipline records are available upon request.

August 9, 2012
MARK STEPHEN SMITH, 53, of Long Beach was suspended for three years, stayed, placed on five years of probation with a two-year actual suspension and until he proves his rehabilitation, and he was ordered to take the MPRE and comply with rule 9.20 of the California Rules of Court. The order took effect Aug. 9, 2012.Smith stipulated to five acts of misconduct in two matters.In the first, he kept funds from client settlements to pay medical liens, but his personal use of the trust accounts depleted the funds before medical providers could be paid. He stipulated that he commingled funds in his client trust account, failed to maintain client funds in a trust account and misappropriated client funds that were meant to pay medical liens.In a personal injury matter, Smith filed a lawsuit and settled the case for $15,000. He gave the client $8,000 but should have kept $3,750 in his trust account to pay his client’s medical liens. He allowed the balance in the account to fall to $224. Smith eventually paid of $4,327.30 in medical liens. He stipulated that he misappropriated $1,000 and failed to maintain at least that amount in his client trust account.Smith was privately reproved in 2001 for failing to perform legal services competently. In mitigation, he cooperated with the bar’s investigation and demonstrated remorse.
