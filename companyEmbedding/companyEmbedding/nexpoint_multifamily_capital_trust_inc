(3) The annualized distribution rate is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated above without compounding), divided by the price quote per share as of the date indicated above. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. As of the quarter ending December 31, 2016, 100% of distributions were paid from net investment income from operations.

Significant portions of these distributions were not based on our investment performance and such waivers and reimbursements by NexPoint Advisors may not continue in the future. If NexPoint Advisors does not agree to reimburse certain of our expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or borrowings.

Hey, multifamily industry, say hello to NexPoint Residential Trust Inc., a new real estate investment trust. Its strategy is pursuing investments in Class A and B multifamily properties with a value-add component where they can invest capital to provide “lifestyle” amenities to “workforce” housing. MHN chatted with Matt McGraner, executive vice president and chief investment officer at NexPoint and managing director of real estate at Highland Capital Management, to learn the story of the growing company.
MHN: How did the company get started?
McGraner: We got started in 2013 as a REIT underneath a closed-end fund. James Dondero, our president and founder, was searching for yield uncorrelated to the public, debt and equity markets, and he was managing a fund called NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (NHF) and didn’t like anything he was seeing in the marketplace so he looked to real estate and really liked owning real estate directly but couldn’t do it in the closed-end fund so, to our knowledge, we were the first people to ever come up with the idea of forming a private REIT under the closed-end fund. We did that in early 2013.
We bought our first multifamily deal in October 2013 and saw a lot of opportunity in the marketplace, liked the story and the strategy of the middle-income workforce housing Class B multifamily strategy. We were growing that rapidly – we did about 40 transactions over the course of 2013 and 2014. It got to the point where it was becoming such a large part of the parent fund that we had to do something with it. We looked for a number of ways to get value for the shareholders, one of which was taking it public and listing the shares on the New York Stock Exchange. That was the original route we chose to do to get value. It was a fairly unique structure and it had never been done before.
MHN: Why did you choose to get involved with workforce housing specifically?
McGraner: We like it for a number of reasons – we like the Class B workforce housing strategy because it’s recession-proof. We really only need $750 in rent per unit to make a 6 percent yield in our markets which is really attractive. You contrast that to a Class A building in our market that earns $1,500 per unit to make a four percent yield. Particularly where the markets are today, cap rates being at historic lows for multifamily, we think when interest rates do rise cap rates will hurt the Class A building more than they’ll hurt the Class B building given that there’s such a delta between the $750 in rent we need to achieve our yields versus the nicer luxury properties and/or single-family housing. Our typical tenant is renter by necessity and has been a renter all their life so what we try to do is buy assets at great spaces, significant discount to replacement cost and go in and invest anywhere from $4,000-$10,000 per unit to improve the living spaces for the middle income renters.
For example, take a two- to three-story garden apartment complex that hasn’t been touched in the last decade or two, we’ll come in and add 2015 amenities you might see at a luxury building and put them in place at a 1985 construction building. We’ll add resort-style pools, cabanas, outdoor furniture, an outdoor kitchen, outdoor grills, update the leasing centers from the tired, old furniture and tile flooring to more of a Starbucks-style café, and put a few Apple computers in there and make it more of an interactive space. On the interiors we’ll spend anywhere from $3,000-$7,000 per unit removing carpet and installing hardwood floors, removing old blinds and put in two-inch blinds, put in California Closets, upgrading the appliance packages from a white to a black or stainless, and removing vinyl countertops and installing granite. Once we’re done with the improvements we typically see a rental increase of $90 or 25 percent more so it’s a good business on the one hand, we’re making great returns and on the other hand, we’re providing an upgraded space for the tenants.
Left: Office before Right: Office after
MHN: Since 2013, what has been your biggest struggle?
McGraner: In early 2013, it was trying to be competitive in the marketplace and buy assets that made sense for our underwriting. The way we got around that was we started buying portfolios at wholesale discounts and we teamed up with our property manager/operating partner out of Des Moines, Iowa, BH Management Services. They’re one of the largest privately owned operators of garden-style multifamily middle-income apartments that we like to purchase and we are their largest client to date so they were a great asset in helping us overcome winning deals. Fast forward to today, even though we’re a billion dollars in assets, we’re still very small when it comes to publicly traded REIT so we didn’t do a traditional style IPO where you had bankers lead in underwriting and have research coverage day one so we’re trying to overcome the fact that we’re small and no one really knows who we are.
That being said, we’ve reached out to a number of investors and done hundreds of calls, hundreds of meetings with investors and tried to tell a story. Everyone that listens to this story is interested, we’re doing the same thing the larger private equity firms are doing in the private markets, we’re just taking it to the public markets and we’re really the only pure play value-add operator that’s traded in the public markets in the U.S. So, getting the story out has been hard to do without having an investment bank research analyst in our corner. We are optimistic that we’ll get research coverage in the next month or two so that’ll help. Getting our name out there and making sure people know who we are has been the biggest challenge and the only thing we can do is continue executing on the strategy and driving performance and at some point hopefully people take notice.
MHN: What’s in the pipeline for NexPoint?
McGraner: We’re excited to be fully public for a year and have a track record of four full consecutive quarters of earnings and leases. That’ll be in March we’ll look forward to that. At the same time, we become shelf eligible, which means we can have a registration statement that’s filed on the shelf with the SEC, so that we can raise capital in a pretty quick manner. You have to be a year public to do that so that’s a big milestone it helps a company like ours grow. We’ve looked at a few deals and we just purchased a couple in Phoenix last week that we’re really excited about and that’s a new market for us.
We’re looking forward to seeing a full turn of the fruits of our labor and the cap X, both in terms of across the portfolio the numbers and the results of having 41 upgraded deals with brand new leasing centers, pools and turned units. That’ll be cool once we get the full portfolio running and seeing how that fresh product out there is received by people of all ages, especially the millennial age group.
Left: Pool before Right: Pool after
MHN: Where do you see the future of workforce housing going based on your experience so far?
McGraner: I think the workforce Class B strategy has become more in vogue, we’re seeing a lot of new entrants into the market. I’m still optimistic that there’s room to grow rents and provide these affordable spaces without pricing ourselves out of the market and having our tenants move on to something that might be a newer asset like 2005 or 2010 build. That’ll always be on our minds and challenging but as long as Fannie and Freddie are in the market, which we don’t see that GSE disappearing anytime soon, and as long as you can still buy apartments that have been well-maintained and occupied for 20 plus years at decent yields at 5.5 to 6.5 percent yields I think it’s still going to be a very liquid, highly transactional, very exciting space to be.
You couple that with technology and the building products of today that are being implemented into these older properties, you’re taking the obsolescence out of these deals and taking a product that’s pretty sleepy and we all think of as maybe our first apartment or something we might not otherwise want to live in and you’re walking into a unit of a 1985 construction deal and having a very modern white cabinetry with brush nickel finishes, stainless steel, granite countertops and hardwood floors. I think that as long as people continue to put money in the deals and upgrade the spaces, you’re changing neighborhoods; you’re pouring capital into pockets of cities that might otherwise not have seen it so it’s really changing and upgrading the face of the neighborhood too.
MHN: What else should our readers know?
McGraner: We’re new but we’re not new to investing. Highland’s been around since 1993. We’re a solid pedigree in investing, especially in conjunction with our partner BH. We have 22 billion assets across the firm so we have the capabilities to grow the company and perform.
We’re really the only workforce housing pure play multifamily REIT in the space. Most other multifamily REITS are focusing on the same thing – upgrading their portfolios, buying newer deals, buying lower yielding assets on the coastal markets – so we’ve always been contrarian in zigging while others are zagging. If you want a 3-percent yield and you want a Class A luxury multifamily REIT on the coast there’s 10 or 12 to choose from, but if you want something different, a little higher yield with a recession-proof strategy, I think it’s important to take a look at our company.
We own 15 percent of the stock of the company and I know we’re small but I’m still not sure any other REIT owns as much of their company as we do so it’s aligning ourselves with our shareholders. It’s a big positive and we’re continuously supporting the stock and the story and we’ll continue to do so because we believe in it.

NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund Announces Multifamily REIT Spin-Off | Business Wire


























































NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund Announces Multifamily REIT Spin-Off






September 29, 2014 07:01 AM Eastern Daylight Time



DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--NexPoint 
      Credit Strategies Fund (NYSE: NHF) announced today a plan to 
      separate its business into two separate and independent publicly traded 
      companies:
    



        NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (“NHF”), which will continue to 
        operate as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company; and
      

        NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (“NXRT”), which will acquire, own, 
        operate and selectively develop multifamily real property.
      


      NHF plans to effect the separation through a spin-off in which it will 
      distribute all of the outstanding shares of NXRT common stock to NHF’s 
      shareholders on a pro rata basis. At the time of the spin-off, 
      NXRT, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of NHF, will hold all 
      or a majority interest in all of the multifamily properties that NHF 
      holds interests in through its subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC prior to the 
      spin-off.
    

      NXRT intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate 
      investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 
      commencing with its first taxable year of operations as a separate 
      public company. NXRT intends to file an application to list its shares 
      on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NXRT.”
    

      NXRT will be externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P., 
      an affiliate of NexPoint Advisors, the advisor for NHF, and Highland 
      Capital Management, L.P., a leading global alternative asset manager 
      and an SEC-registered investment advisor which, together with its 
      affiliates, has approximately $19 billion in assets under management as 
      of June 30, 2014. NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. will conduct 
      substantially all of NXRT’s operations and manage NXRT’s real estate 
      investments. The members of the management team of NexPoint Real Estate 
      Advisors, L.P. are expected to be James Dondero, Scott Ellington, Brian 
      Mitts, Matt McGraner, and Matthew Goetz. The management team has 
      significant experience across real estate investing, private lending, 
      and private equity.
    

      “We believe the spin-off of NXRT from NHF allows us to continue 
      developing and optimizing our real estate portfolio as a standalone 
      product,” said Brian Mitts, Chief Operating Officer of NexPoint Advisors.
    

      NXRT has filed a registration statement on Form 10 relating to the 
      spin-off with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The spin-off is 
      subject to customary conditions, including effectiveness of the 
      registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, execution of inter-company agreements and final approval by 
      NHF’s board of trustees. NHF anticipates that the spin-off will be 
      completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, but there can be no assurances 
      regarding the final terms and structure of the spin-off or that it will 
      be completed. In addition, NHF management affirmed that NHF does not 
      intend to “stand still” or otherwise abate its acquisition program 
      during the pendency of the transaction, and references to the property 
      counts, capitalization or financial condition of either NHF or NXRT and 
      similar statements may change as a result of acquisitions, expenditures 
      or other changes made prior to the effective date of the spin-off.
    

      “Our experienced and dedicated real estate team continues to see 
      attractive investments in multifamily properties in Texas and the 
      Southeastern United States. This spin-off offers a more flexible and 
      efficient platform to invest in these opportunities,” said Matt 
      McGraner, Managing Director of Real Estate at Highland Capital 
      Management.
    

      Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. will be serving as financial 
      advisor to NHF in connection with the spin-off. Jones Day is serving as 
      legal advisor to NXRT. Dechert LLP is serving as legal advisor to NHF.
    

About NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund


      NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund is a closed-end fund managed by NexPoint 
      Advisors, L.P. NHF’s investment objectives are to provide both current 
      income and capital appreciation. NHF is invested primarily in below 
      investment grade debt and equity securities and has the ability to hedge 
      risk. The manager attempts to exceed the return of the Dow Jones Credit 
      Suisse Hedge Fund Index in a transparent, registered fund format with 
      monthly dividends. An investment in NHF is not appropriate for all 
      investors. No assurance can be given that NHF will achieve its 
      investment objectives.
    

      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      to net asset value. The price of NHF’s shares is determined by a number 
      of factors, several of which are beyond the control of NHF. Therefore, 
      NHF cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net 
      asset value. Past performance does not guarantee future results. More 
      information about NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund is available at www.nexpointadvisors.com.

      management’s current expectations, assumptions and beliefs about its 
      business, financial performance, operating results, the industry in 
      which it operates and other future events. Forward-looking statements 
      can often be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” 
      “intends,” “plans,” “predicts,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “may,” 
      “will,” “should,” “would,” “could,” “potential,” “continue,” “ongoing,” 
      similar expressions, and variations or negatives of these words. These 
      forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements 
      regarding the anticipated timing, structure, benefits and tax treatment 
      of the proposed separation of NHF’s multifamily real estate assets and 
      its other investments, and future financing plans, growth prospects and 
      operating and financial performance. They are not guarantees of future 
      results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that 
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in 
      any forward-looking statement.
    

      Risks and uncertainties related to the proposed spin-off include: NHF’s 
      and NXRT’s ability to obtain all necessary consents and approvals and 
      satisfy all conditions to the spin-off; the ability to expand the real 
      estate business following the spin-off; and the potential diversion of 
      management’s attention from traditional business concerns. Other risks 
      and uncertainties relate to NXRT’s business, its industry and its common 
      shares and include: investment risk; changes in interest rates; risks 
      associated with investing in high multifamily properties; risks 
      associated with NXRT’s use of leverage; and market risks generally. 
      Readers should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking 
      statements and are encouraged to review NXRT’s Form 10 registration 
      statement, including its preliminary information statement, filed with 
      the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 29, 2014, 
      for a more complete discussion of the risks and other factors that could 
      affect NXRT’s business, prospects and any forward-looking statements. 
      Except as required by the federal securities laws, NXRT does not 
      undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events, changing circumstances or any other reason after the date 
      of this press release.

Investment Strategy



NexPoint Residential Trust

NXRT intends to employ a value-add component at a majority of its acquisitions in an attempt to improve rental rates and the net operating income at its properties. Our value-add program will be implemented by BH Management Services, LLC (“BH”), our property manager, at the direction and supervision of NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. (“Adviser”). We seek to own and operate multifamily properties in areas that have:

Major employment centers, parks and schools nearby;
A stable work force, combined with positive net population growth;
Well-paying jobs provided by a diverse mix of employers;
A favorable cost of living;
Reduced competition from larger multifamily REITs and large institutional real estate investors who tend to focus on select coastal and gateway markets; and
A limited supply of new affordable housing.

We may also allocate up to approximately 30% of our portfolio to investments in real estate-related debt, mezzanine and preferred equity and other securities in situations where the risk-return profile is more attractive than investments in common equity. This strategy would be designed to minimize potential losses during market downturns and maximize risk adjusted total returns to our stockholders in all market cycles.


Delivering Value To Our Investors
NXRT invests in multifamily properties with a value-add component in markets with some of the strongest population and employment growth in the United States. We target undercapitalized or mismanaged multifamily real property where we can invest capital and asset management resources to deliver same store NOI growth that is historically atypical of publicly-traded multifamily REITs. We believe our strategy provides investors with development-like total returns without taking development risk.

Delivering Value To Our Residents
Our value-add programs seek to provide “life-style” amenities to “work force” housing while maintaining a reasonable cost of living for our residents. Typical upgrades at each of our properties include interior improvements such as black or stainless steel appliances, new kitchen cabinets and lighting fixtures, and faux-wood floors throughout living areas. We also invest a significant amount of capital improving community amenities such as: renovating and updating the leasing office and clubhouse, adding or upgrading fitness centers, building dog parks, and updating pool areas.

Our Portfolio
As of March 31, 2017, NXRT owns all or a majority interest in a portfolio of multifamily properties, or the Portfolio, primarily located in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States consisting of 40 multifamily properties encompassing 13,225 units of apartment space. For more information on the properties we own all or a majority interest in, please see our most recent quarterly filing.
Our Adviser
Under the Advisory Agreement we are externally managed by our Adviser, which will conduct substantially all of our operations and provide asset management for our real estate investments. We will not have any employees while the Advisory Agreement is in effect.

All investment decisions will be made by the Adviser, subject to general oversight by the Adviser’s investment committee and the Board of Directors of NXRT (the “NXRT Board”). The members of the Adviser’s management team are James Dondero, Brian Mitts, Matt McGraner, Matthew Goetz and Scott Ellington. The management team has significant experience across real estate investing, private lending and private equity. See “Our Adviser, the Advisory Agreement and Our Property Manager” for more information on the members of the management team and their backgrounds. The NXRT Board, which is comprised of a majority of directors who are independent for NYSE purposes and who would not constitute “interested persons” as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), will oversee and monitor the investment performance of NXRT. Our Adviser will be responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on prospective investments, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments on an ongoing basis.

Our Property Manager
We have entered into management agreements with BH Management Services, LLC (“BH”), the Company’s property manager, who manages the Company’s properties and supervises the implementation of the Company’s value-add program. BH is an affiliate of the noncontrolling interest member of the Company by virtue of ownership in certain VIEs through BH’s affiliates. The property management fee is approximately 3% of the monthly gross income from each property managed. Currently BH manages all of our properties. Additionally, the Company may pay BH certain other fees, including one-time setup and inspection fees and construction supervision fees. See latest filings for additional information on fees paid to our property manager.

BH has significant experience operating and leasing multifamily properties, having begun business in 1993 and currently operating and leasing approximately 60,000 multifamily units across the country. 

Our Sponsor
Highland Capital Management, L.P. (“Highland”) is an SEC-registered investment adviser which, together with its affiliates, had approximately $13.4 billion in assets under management as of May 31, 2017. Highland is one of the largest and most experienced global alternative credit managers. The firm specializes in credit strategies, such as credit hedge funds, long-only funds and separate accounts, distressed-for-control private equity, collateralized loan obligations, mutual funds, closed-end funds, ETFs and non-traded products. Highland also offers alternative investments, including emerging markets, long/short equities, real estate and natural resources. The members of Highland’s real estate team, both during their tenure at Highland and in their previous roles before joining Highland, and BH have a long history of investing in real estate and debt related to real estate properties.
