Announces Expansion of U.S. Distribution for RAMP(R) Cardiovascular ProductsMarketwireJanuary 3, 2013ReblogShareTweetShareVANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwire - Jan 3, 2013) -  Response Biomedical Corp. (RBM.TO)(RPBIF) today announced that it has entered into a distribution agreement with Laboratory Supply Company, Inc. (LABSCO), a leading distributor of innovative diagnostic technologies and laboratory products to hospitals, physician office laboratories and alternate healthcare settings with principal offices in Louisville, KY, USA to distribute its Cardiovascular portfolio of RAMP® products in the U.S. exclusively to hospitals with less than 150 beds.The U.S. Point of Care Testing (POCT) market is projected to be approximately $3.1B in 2013, representing the second largest In Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) category in the U.S. It is expected to continue to grow at 7.0% per year over the next several years1.1 Trimark Publications, April 2011 Volume: TMRPOC11-0401The distribution agreement was entered into between Response Biomedical''s newly formed, wholly owned U.S. subsidiary Response Point of Care Inc. and LABSCO for an initial term of three years and is renewable annually thereafter upon mutual agreement. LABSCO will initially market Response''s cardiovascular POC test panels on the RAMP® Reader in all settings and on the RAMP® 200 reader in laboratory settings. Response will continue to market the cardiovascular POC test panel on both the RAMP® 200 reader and RAMP® Reader outside the US, and the RAMP® Flu A+B Assay and RAMP® RSV Assay on the RAMP® 200 reader globally where approved for sale by relevant regulatory authorities."This is a very important agreement for Response as it marks a significant step into the U.S. market for POCT in the cardiovascular arena which is one of the largest markets in the world. The RAMP® technology has been extremely well-received globally and we look forward to expanding this acceptance to U.S. based hospitals and laboratories. We believe that LABSCO has the experience and reputation to maximize our efforts to gain traction and to help us penetrate a market that we believe will greatly enhance our growth in the near term and beyond," commented Tim Shannon, Senior Vice President of World Wide Sales and Marketing for Response Biomedical Corp.The RAMP® enabling platform is a portable scanning fluorescence quantitative analysis platform for near patient testing that enables rapid and robust quantitative results. The platform includes easy software upgrades, data management capabilities and unique interface options. The RAMP® Reader features a small footprint and attractive ease of use for moderate throughput settings. The RAMP® 200 Reader has innovative design features, including the multi-port capability to run up to 12 tests per hour on one module and up to 36 tests per hour, using three modules. This allows tests to be run on multiple patients simultaneously or multiple assays to be run for one patient. More information on the proprietary RAMP® technology can be found at www.responsebio.com."Our new agreement with Response Biomedical is very exciting. LABSCO is in a strong strategic position to reach out to hospitals of under 150 beds, regional reference labs and physician labs on behalf of our important new partner," says Hank Struik, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of LABSCO. "With our team of laboratory experts and specialists, we look forward to advancing the representation of Response Biomedical''s cardiac markers in an ever-changing, competitive market."About Response Biomedical Corp.Response develops, manufactures and markets rapid on-site diagnostic tests for use with its RAMP® platform for clinical and environmental applications.

By eliminating the need for all to have health insurance, the insurance companies know that costs will spiral out of control.  People who think they are healthy (now) and short on cash will bail.  Sicker people will remain, so costs will go up.  Other people who think they are healthy (now) and who can't afford the higher costs will drop out.  Costs will go up.  

While this affects me (as a self-employed person), you may think it doesn't affect you and your employer-based insurance.  Oops.  With none of the ACA cost constraints, prices will return to 6% or 8% annual increases (increases are currently about 4%).  Your salary will only increase about 2% yearly.  After 10 years your insurance costs will double, while your salary will go up about 25%.  Oops.Join the Conversation1 / 52k

Response Biomedical Corp. Receives Final Clearance To Launch Its Lead Clinical Product Line To Assist In The Rapid Detection Of Heart Attacks

Tue, May 25, 2004

 Vancouver, British Columbia, May 25, 2004 - Response Biomedical Corp. (TSX-V: RBM), today announced that it has received regulatory clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market its RAMP* Cardiac Marker Test for detecting CK-MB to assist in the rapid diagnosis of heart attack or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Last week, the Company received FDA clearance of its high sensitivity RAMP test for detecting troponin I, broadly recognized as the cardiac marker of choice allowing increased sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing AMI. The Company has now received FDA 510(k) regulatory clearance for its fluorescence-based RAMP Reader for general clinical use, and three RAMP Cardiac Marker Tests for detecting myoglobin, troponin I and CK-MB.   "FDA clearance to commercially introduce the lead RAMP clinical product line into the US medical market will enable the Company to aggressively expand its international marketing and distribution network over the coming months," states Bill Radvak, President and CEO. "Based on the performance during multi-center US clinical trials, the Company is confident the RAMP Cardiac Marker Tests will receive strong market adoption, as we pursue further clinical applications in stroke, oncology and infectious disease testing."    Rapid diagnosis of AMI is critical to patient outcomes. Every minute that passes after the occurrence of a heart attack without medical treatment reduces the patient's chance of survival. Cardiac markers are proteins released in the blood following damage to heart tissue, which may represent a heart attack.  RAMP provides a quantitative result in approximately 15 minutes, compared to several hours turnaround time for traditional laboratory testing.    "The RAMP System will facilitate improved patient care by providing physicians with lab-quality information in a matter of minutes to quickly and accurately diagnose heart attacks at the point-of-care (POC).  At the same time, RAMP has the capability to significantly reduce health care costs associated with unnecessary hospital admissions of patients with symptoms often mistaken for cardiac arrest," adds Radvak.    The US market alone for POC cardiac marker tests in 2004 is estimated to be approximately US$150 million. The world cardiac rapid assay market is expected to achieve an average annual growth rate of 20 - 25 percent for the near future. Each year in the United States, approximately eight million Americans are admitted to emergency rooms for severe chest pain associated with suspected AMI.  The total cost of unnecessary admissions and misdiagnosis is over US$4 billion.  The global POC market generated revenues worth $3.3 billion in 2002 and is expected to reach $5.5 billion in 2009. This market is growing faster than the total in vitro diagnostics market.    About Response Biomedical:     Response Biomedical develops, manufactures and markets rapid on-site diagnostic tests for use with its RAMP System for clinical and environmental applications, providing reliable information in minutes anywhere, every time. RAMP represents a new paradigm in diagnostic testing, with the potential to be adapted to more than 250 medical an non-medical tests currently performed in laboratories. The RAMP System consists of a portable fluorescent Reader and single-use, disposable Test Cartridges. RAMP tests are commercially available for the early detection of heart attack, environmental detection of West Nile virus, and biodefense applications including the rapid on-site detection of anthrax, smallpox, ricin and botulinum toxin. The Company has achieved CE Mark and its Quality Management System is registered to ISO 13485: 1996. Response Biomedical is a publicly traded company, listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the trading symbol "RBM".
