Visa® Commercial Credit Card

 Reward Your Business  with a Versatile Card
 Whether you need a business or purchasing credit card for everyday expenses or travel and entertainment, a City National Visa Commercial Card with  City National Rewards® makes  it easier for you to handle your business needs.*
An Everyday Resource  for You and Your Employees
 You and your employees can use a City National Visa Commercial Card to  purchase goods, services, or obtain cash advances. Your  City National Visa Commercial Card is more convenient than writing checks and  safer than carrying cash.
 Use Anywhere Visa is Accepted
 Your City National Visa Commercial Card can be used at millions of merchants worldwide, including business supply stores, online  merchants, restaurants, airlines, hotels, and more.


    Features
  


Secure and Easy Web Access
You can access your account    online to review transaction data, produce reports and monitor your business    expenses, all through a secure, easy-to-use Web-browser interface. 


Flexibility
Define and control access to your account    information so you use only the features and functions that meet your business    needs.


Keeping Track
Manage accounts, including transaction    and expense data. Generate reports on all cards issued to your employees.


Set Employee Allowances,    Limits & Restrictions
Manage your expenses, set individual employee credit limits, review    transactions, and restrict or allow the business establishments where the    card may be used (e.g., office supply stores, gas stations, etc.) and review    transactions at-a-glance. 


Manage Accounts & Statements Online
Make payments from several different    accounts or just one.  You have the    option to select statement amount, other amount or current balance. 



Auto    Debit
Set up automatic    payments to pay your City National  Visa Commercial Card.



View & Download Transaction Data
View transactions for each account holder    or by the entire unit. Detailed information includes date of transaction,    date of posting, merchant, and amount. You can view and print statements from    the last 18 months. 


Transfer Data to Accounting    Programs
Easily download transactions    into Excel, MS Money and QuickBooks, or tab-delimited files. 


Authorizations / Declines
View authorizations and declines as they happen. If a cardholder    is declined at the point of sale, you can review an account to see the reason    why the purchase was declined.  Reasons    vary from lack of available credit to incorrect expiration date or CVV    (security) code.


Create Accounts 
You can create new credit card accounts via the online system. Your business    will receive the new card in 7-10 days from submission. If a rush is required    please call City National to expedite your request.


Real Time Credit Line Adjustments
Instantly adjust the credit lines for any cardholder.



Additional Options

Create Specialized or Standard Reports - Instead of downloading transactions per account holder, you can download all    transactions for all accounts using one report. There are many standard    reports already created like transaction reports, merchant reports and    cardholder profile reports. 
Complete & Manage Expense Reports Online - 
      Employees can complete expense reports online and    email the reports to various approvers. Expense Management provides    account holders, approving managers, and program administrators with the    following capabilities: transaction viewing, splitting, editing, approval workflow,    data export capabilities, allocation logic, and the ability to enter    out-of-pocket expenses. This feature eliminates paper and streamlines the    expense report process. 
Attach Allocation Codes: GL codes, cost centers and    other allocation strings can be attached to each transaction to facilitate    better reporting.

In addition to the optional online    management tool, you receive the following Visa benefits:1


    Benefits
  


Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver
Provides reimbursement for damage due to collision or theft up to    the actual cash value of most rental vehicles.


Travel &    Emergency Assistance Services
Puts the cardholder in touch with the appropriate emergency services should    the need arise. 


$100,000 Travel    & Accident Insurance Coverage
Automatically insures the cardholder against accidental loss of life, limb,    sight, speech or hearing while riding as a passenger, in any licensed common    carrier, provided the entire cost of the passenger(s) fare has been charged    to the Visa credit card. 



Rewards
Plus, City National Rewards can be a feature of your City National  Visa Commercial Card.

Points    - All purchases made on any    City National Commercial Card registered to your business will    automatically earn your company Points. Earn one Point per $1 spent on Commercial Card purchases.2
No    Cap or Expiration - There is no annual cap on Points and Points do not expire as long as    your Commercial Card account remains open.3
Using    Points - Points can be redeemed for a variety of  items such as gift cards,    merchandise, airfare, hotels, cruises, rental cars, experiential awards, and other    exclusive offers. 
Combined    Points - Points from all of your City National Credit Cards    (business and personal) with City National Rewards may be combined into one Rewards account.4
Travel    without Blackout Dates - We offer premier-quality    awards designed for City National clients. Use Points to    purchase airline tickets on most national and international carriers--with no    blackout dates. 


Learn more about City National    Rewards Program Terms, Conditions and Program Rules.

Commercial Card Points Redemption. Obtain form

Report a Lost or  Stolen Card

Don't  Want Rewards?

Getting Started 
 To learn more, call us Monday through Thursday

* Subject to credit approval.

Certain restrictions,  limitations and exclusions apply. Ask  for details.
Points are earned on net purchases only (purchases less returns and  credits).  PIN-based and ATM transactions  do not earn Points.
As long as your Commercial  Card account is open and the Rewards Program has not ended, your Points do not  expire. If, however, your Commercial Card account is closed, any unredeemed  Points remaining on the date of account closure are forfeited and expire. If  the Rewards Program is terminated for any reason, you will be notified, in  which event you will have at least 60 days to redeem your Points. After this  redemption period, any unredeemed Points will expire.
Certain restrictions apply for combining Points from business and  personal City National Visa Credit Cards that come with City National Rewards.  See City National Rewards Householding Program Rules for details.

As a corporate trustee, City National can offer you benefits beyond those of an individual trustee, including objectivity and continuity of service.

If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

Trade Services Products
Import-Related Products
Import Letters of Credit
Let our Letters of Credit, whether denominated in U.S. dollars or a foreign currency, provide certainty of payment to your foreign supplier. Your credit lines can be structured to allow for the issuance of sight, usance or deferred payment letters of credit, depending on the terms negotiated with your vendor. And now City National offers you the convenience of initiating and tracking your Letters of Credit online.  
Bankers' Acceptance Financing of Imports
We also offer Bankers' Acceptances in a wide range of maturities to match your sales cycles. You can request City National Bank to issue a term Letter of Credit (i.e., payable 30-180 days after sight), thus postponing the debit to your account until maturity. We can still pay the exporter at sight, however, since the transaction can be financed at a rate (the discount rate) less than a traditional credit facility. Why? Banks are not required to provide reserves for financing such transactions, and since acceptances are extremely liquid, the bank readily has access to a lower-cost source of funds.
Incoming Documentary Collections
Our proven capability in documentary collections ensures you and your supplier control over the shipping and financial documents that will result in more efficient, predictable payment. Import collections are most secure when both buyer and seller have developed a comfortable level of mutual trust and understanding. The importer will be required to either pay (D/P) or accept (D/A) the draft in order to take possession of the goods, thereby avoiding tie-up of valuable credit lines.
Foreign Draft
Mailing payments overseas? City National Bank drafts are drawn on major banks in the country of the currency and cleared through local channels. We provide more than 25 currencies, with no minimum amount required. We also arrange delivery via regular mail, same-day delivery or overseas courier. By paying in local currency via draft, you avoid the risk of short-changing or overpaying your foreign vendors/suppliers with a U.S. dollar payment whose value has changed from point of initiation to point of conversion.
Foreign Currency Wire
Save time, save money. Move your funds electronically by wiring foreign currency to your overseas vendors/suppliers. The foreign currency is delivered to their bank in their local currency in one-to-two business days.
Payment Guarantee for Trade Transactions
Let our Standby Letters of Credit act as a payment guarantee for your trade transactions. Here the Standby Letters of Credit cover the risk of your nonperformance, thus helping you establish an "open account" relationship with a new supplier. Standby Letters of Credit can also act as bid bonds, performance guarantees and warrantee bonds when you are bidding on a contract. They also are commonly used by importers who must comply with an exporter-required "advance payment" clause.
International Banking Online
Intuitive and simple to use, our integrated online platform supports the international banking needs of business and personal clients. A Foreign Exchange (FX) module streamlines international payments, and supports Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts and other foreign exchange needs. A Trade Services module provides support for trade transactions including Letters of Credit, Documentary Collections, and financing requests. The two modules are available individually or together for a complete online international banking solution.

Export-Related Products
Incoming Foreign Currency Wire
Don't wait for the "check in the mail!" Reduce the time and cost of receiving payment, and guarantee that you have received good funds in your account. City National Bank will convert your foreign currency using our current rates and credit your CNB account directly.
Export Letter of Credit
One of the highest degrees of payment protection. Eliminate the credit risk of your foreign customer by substituting that of their foreign banker. By having City National Bank confirm the Export Letter of Credit, we can also take your risk if you are not being paid on the letter of credit as a result of foreign bank default and country risk.
Collection of Foreign Check Payments
Let us expedite the collection of your funds on overseas drafts and checks to assure you receive quick, accurate credit. We can also provide you with immediate credit to your account at the current exchange rate for items denominated in foreign currencies.
Outgoing Documentary Collections
If you are exporting abroad, you need assurance of payment. Given that it is often difficult to procure cash in advance for your larger shipments, an export documentary collection may be the answer. An export documentary collection offers an economical avenue to maintain control of your goods until payment is made. Moreover, with export collections, the risk of losing title to goods is mitigated. Although there is no bank obligation or undertaking to pay, title documents are released by the bank only upon the buyer's payment (D/P) or acceptance (D/A) of the draft.
Transferable Letters of Credit
A terrific financing tool for small company exporters with limited borrowing capability of their own, or for companies with large single-sale transactions. This mechanism essentially transfers the payment in the letter of credit to a third party - your supplier. In so doing, it enables you to use the first buyer's credit and buy the goods without using your credit line. It is important to note that the wording in the letter of credit itself must expressly state or be designated as transferable.
Assignments of Export Letter of Credit Proceeds
When your vendor asks for more assurance of payment for supplies or materials that are used in your export shipment, offer an assignment of proceeds from your Letter of Credit. Immediately upon our receipt of payment from your Letter of Credit, we will directly pay your vendor the portion you assigned.
Bankers' Acceptance Financing of Exports
Let City National help you take control of your business cash outflow with a negotiable instrument that is drawn on, and accepted by, a bank to finance a trade-related or domestic commercial transaction. Bankers' Acceptance financing of exports is versatile and beneficial to both exporters and importers alike. Under an issuance Letter of Credit (i.e., 30-180 days after shipment), the exporter does not necessarily have to wait until maturity for payment. The exporter can request that City National discount or cash out the Letter of Credit at the time of negotiation (at sight). The benefit is improved cash flow, while still granting the buyer's terms.
Foreign Bank Standby Letters of Credit
Your customer wants to have an "open account" relationship, but you're not comfortable with the risk. Consider accepting a Standby Letter of Credit from your customer's overseas banker. A foreign bank Standby Letter of Credit can guarantee payment to you if your customer defaults on his or her "open account" terms.
Foreign Credit Information
Accessing up-to-date information, and the ability to act upon it, is a key resource in making sound financial decisions. Yet it is often difficult to secure accurate and detailed credit information when conducting business abroad. We can provide access to the in-depth foreign credit information you need to trade confidently and securely through our arrangements with international credit reporting agencies.
Government-Guaranteed Export Lending and Insurance Programs
Eximbank, an agency of the U.S. Government, was established in 1934. The bank's mandate is to support the export sector of U.S. goods and services. The Eximbank Working Capital Guarantee program has been established to help banks and finance companies extend credit to U.S. exporters in need of pre-export credit support. By actively providing a conduit of working capital accessibility for export purposes, the Eximbank of the United States fulfills its mandate to increase and sustain jobs by supporting the export sales of U.S. goods and services. City National Bank expedites the processing of Eximbank 90% guaranteed loans up to $5 million through its Delegated Authority (D/A) status.
Export Working Capital Loans
If you are a U.S. exporter in need of a working capital loan to finance labor, material, assembly, or to buy product for export, our Trade Finance specialists would be pleased to develop a specific Eximbank financing package. In so doing, you will benefit by enhancing cash flow, funding marketing activities, and possibly improving financing costs.
Accounts Receivable Insurance
By employing the Eximbank short-term Export Credit Insurance program, you develop and expand your export sales by protecting against loss in case of a foreign buyer default. With insured receivables you can increase cash flow by borrowing against your foreign receivables, secured by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Indeed, up to a 90% advance is available for export-related accounts receivable. With insurance receivables, you can enhance foreign sales opportunities by arranging more attractive financing and offering more favorable credit terms to your customers.
Medium-term Loans to Foreign Buyers
Eximbank issues guarantees and/or insurance to commercial lenders, providing repayment protection for loans to creditworthy foreign buyers of U.S. exports. City National Bank can extend medium-term credit to the foreign buyer, thereby giving you the competitive edge, particularly in countries where local interest rates are high.
Support for Finance and Contract Performance
Standby Letters of Credit
A Standby Letter of Credit serves to assure the performance of a contractual obligation. They are often used instead of cash deposits, or as performance or bid bonds in both domestic and international transactions. Should the exporter fail to ship, the buyer may recover the advance payment by drawing upon the standby credit issued in his or her favor.
An additional, common need for a standby credit is the buyer's concern regarding the quality/specifications compliance of the product and/or a shipping schedule compliance. Here the Standby Letter of Credit covers the seller's nonperformance. Let our Standby Letters of Credit act as a payment guarantee for trade transactions to help you establish an "open account" relationship with a new supplier. Standby Letters of Credit can also act as bid bonds, performance guarantees and warrantee bonds when you are bidding on a contract, or they can provide financial reimbursement in the event of default. When you are receiving money up front for start-up costs or materials, a Standby Letter of Credit may be required as an advance payments bond to assure that the payment can be recovered in case you default on the contract.
If you wish to offer "open account" terms to your foreign clients, consider obtaining a foreign bank Standby Letter of Credit from their banker to mitigate your risk.

Visa® Commercial Credit Card

 Reward Your Business  with a Versatile Card
 Whether you need a business or purchasing credit card for everyday expenses or travel and entertainment, a City National Visa Commercial Card with  City National Rewards® makes  it easier for you to handle your business needs.*
An Everyday Resource  for You and Your Employees
 You and your employees can use a City National Visa Commercial Card to  purchase goods, services, or obtain cash advances. Your  City National Visa Commercial Card is more convenient than writing checks and  safer than carrying cash.
 Use Anywhere Visa is Accepted
 Your City National Visa Commercial Card can be used at millions of merchants worldwide, including business supply stores, online  merchants, restaurants, airlines, hotels, and more.


    Features
  


Secure and Easy Web Access
You can access your account    online to review transaction data, produce reports and monitor your business    expenses, all through a secure, easy-to-use Web-browser interface. 


Flexibility
Define and control access to your account    information so you use only the features and functions that meet your business    needs.


Keeping Track
Manage accounts, including transaction    and expense data. Generate reports on all cards issued to your employees.


Set Employee Allowances,    Limits & Restrictions
Manage your expenses, set individual employee credit limits, review    transactions, and restrict or allow the business establishments where the    card may be used (e.g., office supply stores, gas stations, etc.) and review    transactions at-a-glance. 


Manage Accounts & Statements Online
Make payments from several different    accounts or just one.  You have the    option to select statement amount, other amount or current balance. 



Auto    Debit
Set up automatic    payments to pay your City National  Visa Commercial Card.



View & Download Transaction Data
View transactions for each account holder    or by the entire unit. Detailed information includes date of transaction,    date of posting, merchant, and amount. You can view and print statements from    the last 18 months. 


Transfer Data to Accounting    Programs
Easily download transactions    into Excel, MS Money and QuickBooks, or tab-delimited files. 


Authorizations / Declines
View authorizations and declines as they happen. If a cardholder    is declined at the point of sale, you can review an account to see the reason    why the purchase was declined.  Reasons    vary from lack of available credit to incorrect expiration date or CVV    (security) code.


Create Accounts 
You can create new credit card accounts via the online system. Your business    will receive the new card in 7-10 days from submission. If a rush is required    please call City National to expedite your request.


Real Time Credit Line Adjustments
Instantly adjust the credit lines for any cardholder.



Additional Options

Create Specialized or Standard Reports - Instead of downloading transactions per account holder, you can download all    transactions for all accounts using one report. There are many standard    reports already created like transaction reports, merchant reports and    cardholder profile reports. 
Complete & Manage Expense Reports Online - 
      Employees can complete expense reports online and    email the reports to various approvers. Expense Management provides    account holders, approving managers, and program administrators with the    following capabilities: transaction viewing, splitting, editing, approval workflow,    data export capabilities, allocation logic, and the ability to enter    out-of-pocket expenses. This feature eliminates paper and streamlines the    expense report process. 
Attach Allocation Codes: GL codes, cost centers and    other allocation strings can be attached to each transaction to facilitate    better reporting.

In addition to the optional online    management tool, you receive the following Visa benefits:1


    Benefits
  


Auto Rental Collision Damage Waiver
Provides reimbursement for damage due to collision or theft up to    the actual cash value of most rental vehicles.


Travel &    Emergency Assistance Services
Puts the cardholder in touch with the appropriate emergency services should    the need arise. 


$100,000 Travel    & Accident Insurance Coverage
Automatically insures the cardholder against accidental loss of life, limb,    sight, speech or hearing while riding as a passenger, in any licensed common    carrier, provided the entire cost of the passenger(s) fare has been charged    to the Visa credit card. 



Rewards
Plus, City National Rewards can be a feature of your City National  Visa Commercial Card.

Points    - All purchases made on any    City National Commercial Card registered to your business will    automatically earn your company Points. Earn one Point per $1 spent on Commercial Card purchases.2
No    Cap or Expiration - There is no annual cap on Points and Points do not expire as long as    your Commercial Card account remains open.3
Using    Points - Points can be redeemed for a variety of  items such as gift cards,    merchandise, airfare, hotels, cruises, rental cars, experiential awards, and other    exclusive offers. 
Combined    Points - Points from all of your City National Credit Cards    (business and personal) with City National Rewards may be combined into one Rewards account.4
Travel    without Blackout Dates - We offer premier-quality    awards designed for City National clients. Use Points to    purchase airline tickets on most national and international carriers--with no    blackout dates.

* Subject to credit approval.

Certain restrictions,  limitations and exclusions apply. Ask  for details.
Points are earned on net purchases only (purchases less returns and  credits).  PIN-based and ATM transactions  do not earn Points.
As long as your Commercial  Card account is open and the Rewards Program has not ended, your Points do not  expire.

If  the Rewards Program is terminated for any reason, you will be notified, in  which event you will have at least 60 days to redeem your Points. After this  redemption period, any unredeemed Points will expire.
Certain restrictions apply for combining Points from business and  personal City National Visa Credit Cards that come with City National Rewards.  See City National Rewards Householding Program Rules for details.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.
