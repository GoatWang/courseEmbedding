Recently I noticed I had trouble seeing the score in the Wildcat games on TV (and I have a big TV!!), not that the scores were anything to brag about right then.I noticed that my good eye seemed to be getting more achey and tired as time went on. Both eyes would water when I tried to squint at the TV – and no, it wasn’t  because of the score!I was petrified about eye surgery, but knew I couldn’t keep straining my eyes any longer, so I finally pulled up my big boy pants and called to schedule the appointment for the initial consultation (which was free by the way!).  Dr Dudee evaluated me and  he was thorough and patient in explaining to me the condition of my eye, my options, etc.  He never seemed rushed or uninterested.  He talked to me in detail to make sure my expectations were realistic.  The really bad eye needed PRK and my other eye was OK for LASIK. I knew immediately that I wanted to go ahead with the surgery and that he was the doctor to do it.  I had both procedures on the same day. The PRK eye took a bit longer to get its proper vision but the final outcome was mindblowing!  I saw things I never knew I wasn’t seeing before! ,A  few weeks after the surgery I got my corrective lenses restriction taken of my driver license.   Jitander Dudee MD, Medical Visionkevindewitt ratedI did my research- both on the internet and talking to some doctor friends and short listed a few places (including Dr. Dudee).  A few weeks later a friend told me she just had her eyelids done by Dr Dudee and she looked great, so I decided to seize the day and went in to have my LASIK evaluation when she had her post-op visit.I honestly didn’t know there was so much information to take in about the procedure (I am type A and like to be fully informed). I watched the video and read the fine print very carefully. Jennifer the lasik nurse was very thorough and friendly. She ran a number of tests, questioned history, etc.  Then I met Dr Dudee and he continued the same but explained the two different options between PRK and Lasik.  Fast forward a week later - the actual procedure was very short and easy.  Dr Dudee and his staff made everything wonderfully efficient and NOT scary. I now have a 20/20 vision - I know because I check it at home (Did I tell you I was type A?)  I'm so grateful for it! Thanks Dr Dudee& staffJitander Dudee MD, Medical Visionkevindewitt ratedI truly appreciate the professionalism the office offers and will be sending anyone and everyone to Dr Dudee’s office for their vision correction needs.  If you are looking to get LASIK eye surgery, your search stops here! After so many years of wearing glasses and contacts, I'm finally free and all thanks to him. He made the entire process feel very comfortable and everyone in his staff is wonderful.  My mom had cataract surgery by Dr Dudee, my husband had PRK and my procedure was a couple weeks later with Lasik. I’m usually too busy (or lazy) to do reviews but your vision is important so if your eyes are in trouble and you need real expertise, this is the place to go!Dudde, Jitander, MDkevindewitt ratedI had been thinking about LASIK but putting it off for years and years even though my eyes were in horrible shape. I had BIG TIME astigmatism in both eyes and my eyes have always been soooo DRY.  I couldn’t even wear the daily disposable contacts.  I admit I had abused them when I was young and foolish thru my  20's  but still didn't look into Lasik until my mid 30's due to fear!  Dr Dudee and his staff really took me by the hand and treated me gently. Boy do I wish I’d done it earlier!  It was quick and painless and now I have wonderful vision – especially for night driving, something that my job depends on! I feel a whole lot better, much safer and am so thankful!Woods Robert Dr.Pamula D. ratedI went to this doctor twice because I thought the first time he was just having a bad day the second time I went there he literally had me in tears he told me in a stern voice to be quiet that he did not like people that ask too many questions, I do not know how doctors are allowed to practice that are so rude, and how do they know what's going on with the patient un less  The patient and Dr. have communication , if you must see this doctor for any reason please do not let him treat you in a negative way stand up to him, because that is exactly what I wish I had doneDudde, Jitander, MDashleywhite ratedI got my procedure done about a year ago as a Valentines gift.The procedure itself took about 5 mins I want to say. The doctor is friendly; he has a good personality and answers all your questions. He explains everything as he is doing it, which is really helpful. Right after the procedure you do not see 20/20 (I didn't at least). I remember my eyes started stinging like I was cutting onions but I couldn't touch my eyes.  When I got home I went to sleep for 4 hrs and when I woke up things were still a bit foggy but I could see!  My boyfriend still looks hot! LOL!!Mazloomdoost, Camellia S, MDLinda M. ratedI have been a patient of Dr. Danesh Mazloomdoost for over a year.  My previous doctor recommend that I go on disability.  Dr. Danesh worked so hard on my behalf. The treatment he did for my pain saved me. I can never thank him enough for helping me. I would recommend him for anyone that needs help with pain management. I now have a drastically changed better quality of life.Tobin, Stuart, MDmyluckyspirit ratedI have been with Dr. Stuart Tobin for a while and I will recommend his office very highly him and his associate are very interested in what you got to say they are very interested in you and your health are caring and helpful so I give them 5* for a job well doneAouad, Rony, MDRosetta T. ratedI would recommend Dr Aouad to anyone needing an Ears Nose Throat Dr. He is awsome very skilled knowledgeable and passionate about what he does for a living. Consider Dr Rony Aouad for your care you wont be disappointed.Marshall Lifestyle Medicine, PscDeon H. ratedDR. FOSTER and his staff are the best. They do everything humanly possible for their patients. My fiance and I have had nothing but a great experience with everyone working here.Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.

                                "Sarah Bishop" This short story was one of the best I've ever read. It had me on the edge of my seat until the very last word.  Jennifer  www.jennswritings.com and www.lulu.com/JStires

"Sarah is an entertaining blast of a story/morality play" Sarah Bishop grabbed me from the preview. The obnoxious 20 year young egomaniac Ryan Mathers is someone we've all met before in our own lives. Ryan relishes his own youth and revels in his ability to seduce young women, even jail-bait young women like his 16 year old amour Laura who he knocks up by mistake and then dumps. The poor girl waxes psychotic over dashing Ryan, and it's the dark, enigmatic Sarah Bishop who enters the scene.  Sometimes transparent, the storyline becomes obvious when Sarah takes Ryan for a ride in her car and there is a pacifier sitting on the passenger seat. I would have preferred a more subtle foreshadowing. But the strength of the story is that it is fast-paced and fun, like a lost episode of Tales From the Crypt or an old Twilight Zone.  I think that this story begs to be in a collection of short horror stories or a series of Sarah Bishop tales. It's a fun PDF read that is worth the buck...

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.
