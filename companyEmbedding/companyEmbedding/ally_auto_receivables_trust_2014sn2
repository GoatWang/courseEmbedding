CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to Ally Auto 
      Receivables Trust 2014-SN2:
    

      --$240,000,000 class A-1 asset-backed notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$109,000,000 class A-2A asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$391,000,000 class A-2B asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$275,000,000 class A-3 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      --$91,900,000 class A-4 asset-backed notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: The pool consists of strong quality leases 
      with a weighted average (WA) FICO score of 762, seasoning of 11.2 months 
      and a diversified residual value (RV) maturity schedule.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement (CE) Structure: 2014-SN2 incorporates a 
      sequential-pay structure. Initial CE to the class A notes is 18.75%, 
      building to 21.75%. Available CE is sufficient to support Fitch's 
      'AAAsf' stressed credit and residual loss assumptions of 4.25% and 
      29.45%, respectively.
    

      Unhedged Floating-Rate Note: The class A-2b notes are expected to pay 
      interest on a floating-rate basis, while the assets pay a fixed rate and 
      will not be hedged. As such, Fitch has stressed the transaction 
      structure using its 'AAA' LIBOR-up stressed assumptions.
    

      Improved Loss Performance: Credit and residual losses on Ally's 
      portfolio have declined significantly from the elevated levels seen in 
      2008 and 2009. This is a result of strong obligor credit quality and a 
      recently solid wholesale used vehicle market, leading to higher recovery 
      rates and residual realization.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates Ally Financial, the parent of Ally, 
      the originator and servicer, 'BB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Fitch 
      believes Ally Financial to be a capable originator, underwriter and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical performance of its managed 
      portfolio and prior securitizations.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch evaluated 
      the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Ally Auto Receivables Trust 
      2014-SN2 to increased credit and residual losses over the life of the 
      transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      relatively little sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, 
      showing downgrades of only one rating category even under Fitch's severe 
      (2.5 times base case loss) scenario. The transaction shows significantly 
      more sensitivity to residual loss volatility, although, even under 
      Fitch's severe scenario, the class A notes would be expected to retain 
      an investment grade rating.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Oct. 10, 2014. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      'Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2014-SN2 - Appendix'. This R&W is compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
