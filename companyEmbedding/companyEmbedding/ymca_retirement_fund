Summary Plan Description


Plan Document: Retirement Plan






 Eligibility Before you can be enrolled in the Retirement Plan, you must meet certain age and service requirements. Read more…   Plan Contributions Contributions to the Plan are based on your salary. Your Y chooses a total contribution rate of 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, or 8%. Within that contribution rate, your Y also determines whether they will require you to save in the Plan.     How Contributions Work Suppose your Y has chosen a 12% contribution rate and your paycheck is $2,500. If your Y makes the entire contribution, $300 will be sent to your YMCA Account after every payroll.    If your Y has chosen to pay 7% and requires you to pay 5%, your Y will send $175 to your YMCA Account and $125 will be deducted from your paycheck for your Personal Account.     Contribution Rate = 12%             Your Paycheck = $2,500    When your Y              Pays All    When You              Pay Some     YMCA Account Contribution  $300   $175     Personal Account Contribution  $0   $125     Total Contribution Each Payroll  $300   $300        Tax Issues Contributions made to your YMCA Account, and the interest credited to that account, are not taxed until you take a withdrawal from your accounts.    If your Y requires you to make contributions to your Personal Account, your contributions have already been taxed. Because your contributions are after-tax, only the interest credited to those contribu­tions is taxed when you take a withdrawal.

How the Fund Works


 

                                                What is a church pension plan?

A church pension plan is a plan that serves the employees of an organization that is either a church or is associated with (and shares common religious bonds with) churches or associations of churches.  On December 21, 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill into law which clarified that plans of the YMCA Retirement Fund are church plans.

                                                How is the YMCA Retirement Fund different from other retirement plans? 

As an administrator of church plans, the Fund can offer retirement income accounts, commingle assets for investment purposes and provide annuities without paying an insurance company. Church plans also provide the annuities themselves at a better rate and lower cost. This is one of the primary benefits of a church plan, and provides a much better benefit to employees. In addition, the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan have a unique plan design. Unlike a typical 401(k) retirement account, retirement savings at the YMCA Retirement Fund are protected during stormy economic times as a result of this unique structure of the plans. Not once in the Fund's 90-year history have account balances ever gone down.

                                                Is the money in the Fund insured by the federal government?

The YMCA Retirement Fund’s plans, like defined contribution plans, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, etc., are not insured by the government.
Print


 

                                                Is money saved in the Fund safe?

Yes. The safety of the Fund is in its highly diversified portfolio, managed by professionals and a dedicated Board of Trustees. Not once in the history of the Fund have account balances ever gone down nor have annuity payments ever been missed. The Fund’s plans are designed in such a way that minimizes the risk of investment loss to the participant.

                                                What is ERISA and does the YMCA Retirement Plan follow the ERISA rules?

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) was passed to protect employee pensions in response to some spectacular company failures in the 1960's, most notably the Studebaker automobile company. They had failed to put aside sufficient money to pay pensions if they went out of business and, when they did, all their retirees lost their pensions. This federal law requires certain standards for participation, enrollment, vesting and benefit payments. It also requires that the people who manage a pension plan (fiduciaries) meet certain standards.  The law generally classifies pension plans into three groups: company plans, government plans and church plans. There are different rules for each of these. It also classifies plans as defined benefit (formula) or defined contribution (individual account). Plans created before ERISA was enacted may not fall clearly into one of these categories.  Although church pension plans are not subject to ERISA, the YMCA Retirement Plan elected to become subject to ERISA in connection with the 2004 legislation confirming its status as a church pension plan.

                                                Who reviews the Fund's operation?

The Fund's financial statements are audited annually by an independent CPA firm. The Fund reports to the New York State Department of Financial Services, viewed by many as the toughest state insurance department in the country. The Fund also reports to the IRS and the Department of Labor.

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

The Fund offers retirement benefits to Y employees who become permanently and totally disabled. That means if an individual is incapable of working for a living, and their condition is not expected to improve, they may be eligible to receive an annuity from the Fund. To qualify for this benefit, the employee must:   be under age 60    have had at least five full years of participation in the Retirement Plan   have become disabled while working for a participating Y   have not taken a withdrawal from their YMCA Account and Personal Account (for Ys that require employee contributions) since leaving a Y   apply for benefits within six months after terminating Y employment    As the Fund’s total & permanent disability claims administrator, Liberty Mutual Group reviews all applications and renders a decision on claims.

                                                What happens if a participant dies while still working for a Y?

Their beneficiary will receive the greater of $10,000 or the sum of the amounts in their Personal Account, YMCA Account (Legacy) and YMCA Account. Any voluntary accounts they have will be paid to their beneficiary as well. All benefits will be paid as either a withdrawal or an annuity.

Beneficiaries


 

                                                Why is it important to designate a beneficiary?

Designating a beneficiary means telling the Fund how to pay out death benefits. It is important that all Fund participants keep their beneficiary designations up-to-date so that their benefits are paid according to their wishes. To designate or update beneficiaries, a participant can either log onto their account and make the change online, or submit a Designation of Beneficiary form to the Fund. If at any time there is a major change in a participant’s life, such as marriage, birth of a child, widowhood or a divorce, they should review their beneficiary designation and make any necessary changes. If a participant dies before retirement without designating a beneficiary, as long as they have been married one year or longer, their surviving spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of their pre-retirement benefit unless she/he decides to waive this benefit. (If a spouse of an active participant waived this benefit prior to the participant attaining age 35, a new waiver must be submitted to the Fund. Otherwise, the spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of the pre-retirement death benefit.)  The remaining pre-retirement benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the participant, then to each of them in equal shares.

                                                What happens if a retiree does not designate a beneficiary?

If a retiree dies without designating a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary they named predeceased them and they did not submit a new Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit form to designate another, their Retired Death Benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the retiree, then to each of them in equal shares. 
Print


 

                                                How does a participant change their beneficiary?

Participants can change their beneficiary at any time. Those who have not yet started their annuity can designate and update their beneficiaries online.  They may also designate their beneficiaries by submitting the proper form to the Fund. The form they use depends on whether or not they still work for the Y. The Designation of Beneficiary—for current Y Employees must be either notarized or signed by HR. The Designation of Beneficiary—for former Y Employees must be notarized.  For participants who have already started their annuity, the Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit must be notarized and mailed in. (Contact the Fund if an annuity has been started under the Principal Guarantee Annuity Option.)  NOTE: Federal law imposes strict rules for married employees designating beneficiaries other than their spouses. The employee must have notarized consent from their spouse if the spouse is not the only beneficiary. 
Print


 

                                                Who can be named as a beneficiary?

Anyone or any entity can be named as a beneficiary. Generally, all people named as beneficiaries get the same choices regarding benefits. However, since estates, trusts, Ys and other organizations do not have a life expectancy, they may only take a withdrawal and are not entitled to an annuity.  Married participants need notarized consent from their spouse if they do not name their spouse as their only primary beneficiary.

                                                If the primary beneficiary predeceases the participant, who will receive the death benefit?

If a participant’s primary beneficiary(ies) predecease(s) them and they do not designate another, their benefits are paid based on how they designated contingent beneficiaries. If the participant did not name any contingent beneficiaries, benefits will be paid to the estate or next of kin. In general, each beneficiary will make a decision to take a withdrawal or an annuity (if amount is $5,000+).

                                                If a participant has accounts in the Retirement Plan and Saving Plan, can they designate different beneficiaries for each plan?

Before retirement, a participant’s beneficiary designation will apply to both plans.   At retirement, they have the option to separately annuitize the plans. A beneficiary designation is necessary for the plan that is left at the Fund. If the Savings Plan is left at the Fund and the Retirement Plan is annuitized, they can designate beneficiaries for the Savings Plan and select separate beneficiaries for the Retirement Plan’s Retired Death Benefit.    Also, if they decide to annuitize the plans separately, they may designate different survivors (if they select the Joint & Survivor Annuity options) for each plan.

Eligibility & Enrollment


 

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

                                                What if an employee moves from one Y to another, or works at multiple Ys?

Ys must take into account all of the employee’s prior and concurrent service at participating Ys when establishing eligibility to be enrolled in the Retirement Plan.  If there is no break in Y employment, or a minimal break in Y employment (less than 12 months), employees who have completed the service and age requirements will be enrolled on the first day of the month following their original anniversary date, even if by that time they are employed by a participating Y other than the one that first hired them. (If their original anniversary date has already passed when they begin employment with the new Y, they will be immediately enrolled.)  Example: Mary, age 23, was hired on July 31, 2014. On January 1, 2015, she was hired part-time at a second participating Y. During each of the 12-month periods beginning on July 31, 2014 and July 31, 2015, she accumulated well over 1,000 hours between her two Y jobs. She was enrolled in the Retirement Plan on August 1, 2016.  Example: Nick, age 36, was hired on February 15, 2015. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on February 15, 2015. From February 15, 2016 to November 30, 2016 he completed another 1,000 hours before leaving his Y. On December 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y. Because Nick had met the eligibility and age requirements already, his new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 2017, the first of the month following his original date of hire.  Example: Gary, age 50, was hired on May 15, 2014. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on May 15, 2014. From May 15, 2015 to August 31, 2015, he worked 500 hours before leaving his Y. On January 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y and worked 500 hours from January 1 to May 14, 2016. His new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on June 1, 2016, the first of the month following his original date of hire. Example: Lydia, age 39, was hired on July 1, 2014. She worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2014. From July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 she completed another 1,000 hours before leaving her Y. On September 1, 2016, she was hired by another participating Y. Because Lydia had met the eligibility and age requirements already, her new Y employer enrolled her immediately in the Retirement Plan (her original date of hire had already passed).

                                                What if an employee believes they have achieved eligibility, but the Y did not enroll them in the Retirement Plan?

Participants should first approach the local plan administrator at their Y and ask them to recheck their eligibility calculations. Participants may also call the YMCA Retirement Fund. If the matter is not resolved to their satisfaction, they may make a written request for a review of the matter in accordance with the claims procedures for the Retirement Plan.

Take a Withdrawal


 

                                                Can a former Y employee who took a withdrawal from the Fund return to work at a Y? 

It is inappropriate and not in the spirit of the existing law to engage in a pre-arranged strategy to collect retirement benefits while still employed. This is a violation of the Fund’s Retirement Plan rules as well as federal tax law.  Whether a participant is hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the participant and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal options prior to taking any action.   YMCA Retirement Plan document:  Section 5.1 &"A Participant’s eligibility to receive benefits under the Retirement Plan... must be the first day of a month subsequent to the cessation of Compensation and the severance from YMCA employment.”  Section 6.3 &"In no event shall any Participant who is employed by a Participating YMCA have the right to a withdrawal of his/her Accumulated Basic Participant Contributions or his/her YMCA Account Balance.”   Treasury Regulations:  Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) &"In order for a pension plan to be a qualified plan under section 401(a), the plan must be established and maintained by an employer primarily to provide systematically for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to its employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or attainment of normal retirement age.”  IRS Rev. Rul. 74-254 &"Revenue Ruling 56-693, as modified by Rev. Rul. 60-323, holds that a pension plan fails to meet the requirements for qualification under section 401(a) of the Code if it permits employees to withdraw prior to normal retirement any part of the funds accumulated on their behalf, which consist of employer contributions or increments thereon prior to the severance of employment or the termination of the plan. Therefore, a pension plan does not qualify if it permits distributions prior to normal retirement and prior to termination of employment or termination of the plan.”

Saving


 

                                                Can a participant contribute money that is not from their Y paycheck?

The only way this can be done is if a participant rolls over money from an eligible pension account. 
Print


 

                                                Are there limits on the amounts a participant can save for retirement?

The federal government sets limits on the total amount of retirement contributions an employee and their employer can make each year, and on the amounts someone can contribute annually to their 403(b) Smart Account.

Retirement


 

                                                Are annuities guaranteed?

The YMCA Retirement Fund can state with the greatest certainty that every retiree and beneficiary will get every penny of the retirement annuity promised to them.  Our actuary reviews and monitors the Plan each year to determine the amount of reserves required to pay all future benefits. The assets of the Fund are invested and closely monitored by Fund management and Trustees in order to provide the highest level of return while protecting the value of the assets.

                                                If a participant stops working for the Y, is it possible to postpone the start of annuity payments?

Yes. As long as the participant is at least age 55 and no longer working for the Y, they can choose to begin their lifetime annuity at any time, regardless of how long they have been away from the Y. However, participants must either start their annuities or take a withdrawal by April 1 of the year after they reach age 70½.

                                                Can a retiree who is receiving an annuity from the Fund, or who has received a lump-sum distribution, return to work at a Y?

There are certain legitimate situations where an individual may become re-employed by a Y after he or she begins receiving a lifetime annuity, or has taken a lump sum distribution from the Fund. Whether they are hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the retiree and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal opinions prior to taking any action.  Here are two examples of acceptable situations:    Jerry retired as a Branch Executive Director and began collecting his retirement benefit. Negotiations with his replacement fell through, and subsequently the Board asked him to return as the Branch Executive in an interim capacity while a new search is undertaken.    Mary retired as Secretary of the Membership Department and began collecting her retirement benefit. After gardening and fixing up her home for six months, she became bored, applied for and was accepted for a part-time position in the development office at another Y.    George terminated his Y employment because he was relocating from his hometown to another state to be closer to his sister. He applied for and received a lump sum distribution from the Retirement Plan. Six months later, George and his sister were not getting along so he moved back to his hometown, applied for and was accepted for another position at the Y.   Here are two examples of unacceptable situations:    A very difficult personal situation necessitated that Brad find a way to add to his household income. Accordingly, he arranged with his supervisor that he would retire, begin collecting his retirement benefit then be rehired to his existing job.    Lucy was all set to retire as the CEO, but the Board had not yet found her replacement. The Board asked her to stay on for three extra months while they extended their search. She agreed, with the understanding that she would continue earning her salary and also start her retirement annuity   Because Robin needed money to pay off her bills, she arranged with her supervisor that she would terminate employment, take a distribution from the Fund then be rehired to her existing job.

Life Changes


 

                                                Why is it important to designate a beneficiary?

To designate or update beneficiaries, a participant can either log onto their account and make the change online, or submit a Designation of Beneficiary form to the Fund.

(If a spouse of an active participant waived this benefit prior to the participant attaining age 35, a new waiver must be submitted to the Fund. Otherwise, the spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of the pre-retirement death benefit.)  The remaining pre-retirement benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the participant, then to each of them in equal shares.

From February 15, 2016 to November 30, 2016 he completed another 1,000 hours before leaving his Y. On December 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y. Because Nick had met the eligibility and age requirements already, his new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 2017, the first of the month following his original date of hire.  Example: Gary, age 50, was hired on May 15, 2014. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on May 15, 2014. From May 15, 2015 to August 31, 2015, he worked 500 hours before leaving his Y. On January 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y and worked 500 hours from January 1 to May 14, 2016.

                                                What is the process for a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)?

A QDRO is a court order that relates to the provision of marital property rights, alimony payments or child support for the benefit of a former spouse, child, or other dependent of the participant. Usually the participant and their former spouse negotiate what part, if any, of the participant’s retirement accounts will be set aside for the former spouse. One of their lawyers will prepare a QDRO and submit it to the divorce court. See the standard procedures and suggested wording. Once approved, the lawyer sends a certified copy to the Fund. The Fund will also look over the participant’s draft QDROs to let them know if all requirements are met before they submit it to the court. For more information, please call the Fund's Legal Department at 800-738-9622. The Fund reviews the QDRO to see that it meets the requirements of both federal pension law and the Retirement Plan. If it does, both the participant and their former spouse are notified as soon as administratively reasonable. The former spouse will then receive a letter indicating the options available (withdrawal, rollovers, and annuity). If the QDRO does not meet the requirements, the QDRO is returned for corrections and a hold is placed on the participant’s accounts, which means the participant will not be able to take a withdrawal or begin an annuity. This hold on their accounts will be in effect until the Fund receives a correct QDRO or for 18 months, whichever is less.

                                                What options does an Alternate Payee have upon being granted an account at the Fund due to a QDRO?

                                                Alternate payees may take an immediate lump sum or rollover of their accounts, regardless of age or account balances. Any amount withdrawn and not rolled over will incur a mandatory 20% income tax withholding from the taxable portion.  Alternate payees who are granted an amount of more than $5,000 in one or both of the Plans (Retirement and/or Savings Plan) may leave their balances with the Fund to gain interest until they decide to withdraw them or start a monthly annuity. They may start an annuity once their former spouse (the original participant) turns age 55, or any time thereafter. Per federal law, they may not designate their new spouse as their survivor for a Joint & Survivor annuity.   Alternate payees who receive $5,000 or less in one of the Plans (Retirement or Savings) must take a lump sum withdrawal or rollover. They may not take an annuity or leave their accounts with the Fund. An exception is for those with more than $5,000 in the Retirement Plan and $5,000 or less in the Savings Plan. As long as they leave their Retirement Plan with the Fund to gain interest, they may leave the Savings Plan as well, even if it contains $5,000 or less.  If the former spouse (original participant) has already annuitized his/her account (is receiving a monthly payment), the alternate payee will receive a portion of this monthly payment. The Alternate Payee will have no lump sum or rollover option and will have no balances to leave at the Fund to gain interest. The amount and other terms of the monthly payment, including start and stop dates, are all determined by the QDRO.

                                                What is a church pension plan?

A church pension plan is a plan that serves the employees of an organization that is either a church or is associated with (and shares common religious bonds with) churches or associations of churches.  On December 21, 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill into law which clarified that plans of the YMCA Retirement Fund are church plans.

                                                How is the YMCA Retirement Fund different from other retirement plans? 

As an administrator of church plans, the Fund can offer retirement income accounts, commingle assets for investment purposes and provide annuities without paying an insurance company. Church plans also provide the annuities themselves at a better rate and lower cost. This is one of the primary benefits of a church plan, and provides a much better benefit to employees. In addition, the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan have a unique plan design. Unlike a typical 401(k) retirement account, retirement savings at the YMCA Retirement Fund are protected during stormy economic times as a result of this unique structure of the plans. Not once in the Fund's 90-year history have account balances ever gone down.

Yes. The safety of the Fund is in its highly diversified portfolio, managed by professionals and a dedicated Board of Trustees. Not once in the history of the Fund have account balances ever gone down nor have annuity payments ever been missed. The Fund’s plans are designed in such a way that minimizes the risk of investment loss to the participant.

The Fund offers retirement benefits to Y employees who become permanently and totally disabled. That means if an individual is incapable of working for a living, and their condition is not expected to improve, they may be eligible to receive an annuity from the Fund. To qualify for this benefit, the employee must:   be under age 60    have had at least five full years of participation in the Retirement Plan   have become disabled while working for a participating Y   have not taken a withdrawal from their YMCA Account and Personal Account (for Ys that require employee contributions) since leaving a Y   apply for benefits within six months after terminating Y employment    As the Fund’s total & permanent disability claims administrator, Liberty Mutual Group reviews all applications and renders a decision on claims.

                                                Why is it important to designate a beneficiary?

Designating a beneficiary means telling the Fund how to pay out death benefits. It is important that all Fund participants keep their beneficiary designations up-to-date so that their benefits are paid according to their wishes. To designate or update beneficiaries, a participant can either log onto their account and make the change online, or submit a Designation of Beneficiary form to the Fund. If at any time there is a major change in a participant’s life, such as marriage, birth of a child, widowhood or a divorce, they should review their beneficiary designation and make any necessary changes. If a participant dies before retirement without designating a beneficiary, as long as they have been married one year or longer, their surviving spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of their pre-retirement benefit unless she/he decides to waive this benefit. (If a spouse of an active participant waived this benefit prior to the participant attaining age 35, a new waiver must be submitted to the Fund. Otherwise, the spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of the pre-retirement death benefit.)  The remaining pre-retirement benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the participant, then to each of them in equal shares.

                                                What happens if a retiree does not designate a beneficiary?

If a retiree dies without designating a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary they named predeceased them and they did not submit a new Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit form to designate another, their Retired Death Benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the retiree, then to each of them in equal shares.

                                                How does a participant change their beneficiary?

Participants can change their beneficiary at any time. Those who have not yet started their annuity can designate and update their beneficiaries online.  They may also designate their beneficiaries by submitting the proper form to the Fund. The form they use depends on whether or not they still work for the Y. The Designation of Beneficiary—for current Y Employees must be either notarized or signed by HR. The Designation of Beneficiary—for former Y Employees must be notarized.  For participants who have already started their annuity, the Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit must be notarized and mailed in. (Contact the Fund if an annuity has been started under the Principal Guarantee Annuity Option.)  NOTE: Federal law imposes strict rules for married employees designating beneficiaries other than their spouses. The employee must have notarized consent from their spouse if the spouse is not the only beneficiary.

                                                What happens if a participant dies while still working for a Y?

Their beneficiary will receive the greater of $10,000 or the sum of the amounts in their Personal Account, YMCA Account (Legacy) and YMCA Account. Any voluntary accounts they have will be paid to their beneficiary as well. All benefits will be paid as either a withdrawal or an annuity.
Print


 

                                                Who can be named as a beneficiary?

Anyone or any entity can be named as a beneficiary. Generally, all people named as beneficiaries get the same choices regarding benefits. However, since estates, trusts, Ys and other organizations do not have a life expectancy, they may only take a withdrawal and are not entitled to an annuity.  Married participants need notarized consent from their spouse if they do not name their spouse as their only primary beneficiary.

                                                If the primary beneficiary predeceases the participant, who will receive the death benefit?

If a participant’s primary beneficiary(ies) predecease(s) them and they do not designate another, their benefits are paid based on how they designated contingent beneficiaries. If the participant did not name any contingent beneficiaries, benefits will be paid to the estate or next of kin. In general, each beneficiary will make a decision to take a withdrawal or an annuity (if amount is $5,000+).

                                                If a participant has accounts in the Retirement Plan and Saving Plan, can they designate different beneficiaries for each plan?

Before retirement, a participant’s beneficiary designation will apply to both plans.   At retirement, they have the option to separately annuitize the plans. A beneficiary designation is necessary for the plan that is left at the Fund. If the Savings Plan is left at the Fund and the Retirement Plan is annuitized, they can designate beneficiaries for the Savings Plan and select separate beneficiaries for the Retirement Plan’s Retired Death Benefit.    Also, if they decide to annuitize the plans separately, they may designate different survivors (if they select the Joint & Survivor Annuity options) for each plan.   
Print


 

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

                                                Can a former Y employee who took a withdrawal from the Fund return to work at a Y? 

It is inappropriate and not in the spirit of the existing law to engage in a pre-arranged strategy to collect retirement benefits while still employed. This is a violation of the Fund’s Retirement Plan rules as well as federal tax law.  Whether a participant is hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the participant and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal options prior to taking any action.   YMCA Retirement Plan document:  Section 5.1 &"A Participant’s eligibility to receive benefits under the Retirement Plan... must be the first day of a month subsequent to the cessation of Compensation and the severance from YMCA employment.”  Section 6.3 &"In no event shall any Participant who is employed by a Participating YMCA have the right to a withdrawal of his/her Accumulated Basic Participant Contributions or his/her YMCA Account Balance.”   Treasury Regulations:  Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) &"In order for a pension plan to be a qualified plan under section 401(a), the plan must be established and maintained by an employer primarily to provide systematically for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to its employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or attainment of normal retirement age.”  IRS Rev. Rul. 74-254 &"Revenue Ruling 56-693, as modified by Rev. Rul. 60-323, holds that a pension plan fails to meet the requirements for qualification under section 401(a) of the Code if it permits employees to withdraw prior to normal retirement any part of the funds accumulated on their behalf, which consist of employer contributions or increments thereon prior to the severance of employment or the termination of the plan. Therefore, a pension plan does not qualify if it permits distributions prior to normal retirement and prior to termination of employment or termination of the plan.”

                                                Can a participant contribute money that is not from their Y paycheck?

The only way this can be done is if a participant rolls over money from an eligible pension account.

                                                Are there limits on the amounts a participant can save for retirement?

The federal government sets limits on the total amount of retirement contributions an employee and their employer can make each year, and on the amounts someone can contribute annually to their 403(b) Smart Account.

                                                Are annuities guaranteed?

The YMCA Retirement Fund can state with the greatest certainty that every retiree and beneficiary will get every penny of the retirement annuity promised to them.  Our actuary reviews and monitors the Plan each year to determine the amount of reserves required to pay all future benefits. The assets of the Fund are invested and closely monitored by Fund management and Trustees in order to provide the highest level of return while protecting the value of the assets.

Yes. As long as the participant is at least age 55 and no longer working for the Y, they can choose to begin their lifetime annuity at any time, regardless of how long they have been away from the Y. However, participants must either start their annuities or take a withdrawal by April 1 of the year after they reach age 70½.

                                                Can a retiree who is receiving an annuity from the Fund, or who has received a lump-sum distribution, return to work at a Y?

There are certain legitimate situations where an individual may become re-employed by a Y after he or she begins receiving a lifetime annuity, or has taken a lump sum distribution from the Fund. Whether they are hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the retiree and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal opinions prior to taking any action.  Here are two examples of acceptable situations:    Jerry retired as a Branch Executive Director and began collecting his retirement benefit. Negotiations with his replacement fell through, and subsequently the Board asked him to return as the Branch Executive in an interim capacity while a new search is undertaken.    Mary retired as Secretary of the Membership Department and began collecting her retirement benefit. After gardening and fixing up her home for six months, she became bored, applied for and was accepted for a part-time position in the development office at another Y.    George terminated his Y employment because he was relocating from his hometown to another state to be closer to his sister. He applied for and received a lump sum distribution from the Retirement Plan. Six months later, George and his sister were not getting along so he moved back to his hometown, applied for and was accepted for another position at the Y.   Here are two examples of unacceptable situations:    A very difficult personal situation necessitated that Brad find a way to add to his household income. Accordingly, he arranged with his supervisor that he would retire, begin collecting his retirement benefit then be rehired to his existing job.    Lucy was all set to retire as the CEO, but the Board had not yet found her replacement. The Board asked her to stay on for three extra months while they extended their search. She agreed, with the understanding that she would continue earning her salary and also start her retirement annuity   Because Robin needed money to pay off her bills, she arranged with her supervisor that she would terminate employment, take a distribution from the Fund then be rehired to her existing job.

                                                What is the process for a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)?

A QDRO is a court order that relates to the provision of marital property rights, alimony payments or child support for the benefit of a former spouse, child, or other dependent of the participant. Usually the participant and their former spouse negotiate what part, if any, of the participant’s retirement accounts will be set aside for the former spouse. One of their lawyers will prepare a QDRO and submit it to the divorce court. See the standard procedures and suggested wording. Once approved, the lawyer sends a certified copy to the Fund. The Fund will also look over the participant’s draft QDROs to let them know if all requirements are met before they submit it to the court. For more information, please call the Fund's Legal Department at 800-738-9622. The Fund reviews the QDRO to see that it meets the requirements of both federal pension law and the Retirement Plan. If it does, both the participant and their former spouse are notified as soon as administratively reasonable. The former spouse will then receive a letter indicating the options available (withdrawal, rollovers, and annuity). If the QDRO does not meet the requirements, the QDRO is returned for corrections and a hold is placed on the participant’s accounts, which means the participant will not be able to take a withdrawal or begin an annuity. This hold on their accounts will be in effect until the Fund receives a correct QDRO or for 18 months, whichever is less.

                                                How is the YMCA Retirement Fund different from other retirement plans? 

As an administrator of church plans, the Fund can offer retirement income accounts, commingle assets for investment purposes and provide annuities without paying an insurance company. Church plans also provide the annuities themselves at a better rate and lower cost. This is one of the primary benefits of a church plan, and provides a much better benefit to employees. In addition, the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan have a unique plan design. Unlike a typical 401(k) retirement account, retirement savings at the YMCA Retirement Fund are protected during stormy economic times as a result of this unique structure of the plans.

A church pension plan is a plan that serves the employees of an organization that is either a church or is associated with (and shares common religious bonds with) churches or associations of churches.  On December 21, 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill into law which clarified that plans of the YMCA Retirement Fund are church plans.

At the May 18, 2017 meeting of the Fund's Board of Trustees, 4% annualized compound interest to participants was set for the period July to December 2017.

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

                                                What if an employee moves from one Y to another, or works at multiple Ys?

Ys must take into account all of the employee’s prior and concurrent service at participating Ys when establishing eligibility to be enrolled in the Retirement Plan.  If there is no break in Y employment, or a minimal break in Y employment (less than 12 months), employees who have completed the service and age requirements will be enrolled on the first day of the month following their original anniversary date, even if by that time they are employed by a participating Y other than the one that first hired them. (If their original anniversary date has already passed when they begin employment with the new Y, they will be immediately enrolled.)  Example: Mary, age 23, was hired on July 31, 2014. On January 1, 2015, she was hired part-time at a second participating Y. During each of the 12-month periods beginning on July 31, 2014 and July 31, 2015, she accumulated well over 1,000 hours between her two Y jobs. She was enrolled in the Retirement Plan on August 1, 2016.  Example: Nick, age 36, was hired on February 15, 2015. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on February 15, 2015. From February 15, 2016 to November 30, 2016 he completed another 1,000 hours before leaving his Y. On December 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y. Because Nick had met the eligibility and age requirements already, his new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 2017, the first of the month following his original date of hire.  Example: Gary, age 50, was hired on May 15, 2014. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on May 15, 2014. From May 15, 2015 to August 31, 2015, he worked 500 hours before leaving his Y. On January 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y and worked 500 hours from January 1 to May 14, 2016. His new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on June 1, 2016, the first of the month following his original date of hire. Example: Lydia, age 39, was hired on July 1, 2014. She worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2014. From July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 she completed another 1,000 hours before leaving her Y. On September 1, 2016, she was hired by another participating Y. Because Lydia had met the eligibility and age requirements already, her new Y employer enrolled her immediately in the Retirement Plan (her original date of hire had already passed).

                                                What if an employee believes they have achieved eligibility, but the Y did not enroll them in the Retirement Plan?

Participants should first approach the local plan administrator at their Y and ask them to recheck their eligibility calculations. Participants may also call the YMCA Retirement Fund. If the matter is not resolved to their satisfaction, they may make a written request for a review of the matter in accordance with the claims procedures for the Retirement Plan.

It is inappropriate and not in the spirit of the existing law to engage in a pre-arranged strategy to collect retirement benefits while still employed. This is a violation of the Fund’s Retirement Plan rules as well as federal tax law.  Whether a participant is hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the participant and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal options prior to taking any action.   YMCA Retirement Plan document:  Section 5.1 &"A Participant’s eligibility to receive benefits under the Retirement Plan... must be the first day of a month subsequent to the cessation of Compensation and the severance from YMCA employment.”  Section 6.3 &"In no event shall any Participant who is employed by a Participating YMCA have the right to a withdrawal of his/her Accumulated Basic Participant Contributions or his/her YMCA Account Balance.”   Treasury Regulations:  Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) &"In order for a pension plan to be a qualified plan under section 401(a), the plan must be established and maintained by an employer primarily to provide systematically for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to its employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or attainment of normal retirement age.”  IRS Rev. Rul. 74-254 &"Revenue Ruling 56-693, as modified by Rev. Rul. 60-323, holds that a pension plan fails to meet the requirements for qualification under section 401(a) of the Code if it permits employees to withdraw prior to normal retirement any part of the funds accumulated on their behalf, which consist of employer contributions or increments thereon prior to the severance of employment or the termination of the plan. Therefore, a pension plan does not qualify if it permits distributions prior to normal retirement and prior to termination of employment or termination of the plan.”

                                                Can a participant contribute money that is not from their Y paycheck?

The only way this can be done is if a participant rolls over money from an eligible pension account.

                                                What is a church pension plan?

A church pension plan is a plan that serves the employees of an organization that is either a church or is associated with (and shares common religious bonds with) churches or associations of churches.  On December 21, 2004, President George W. Bush signed a bill into law which clarified that plans of the YMCA Retirement Fund are church plans.

                                                How is the YMCA Retirement Fund different from other retirement plans? 

As an administrator of church plans, the Fund can offer retirement income accounts, commingle assets for investment purposes and provide annuities without paying an insurance company. Church plans also provide the annuities themselves at a better rate and lower cost. This is one of the primary benefits of a church plan, and provides a much better benefit to employees. In addition, the Retirement Plan and the Savings Plan have a unique plan design. Unlike a typical 401(k) retirement account, retirement savings at the YMCA Retirement Fund are protected during stormy economic times as a result of this unique structure of the plans. Not once in the Fund's 90-year history have account balances ever gone down.

                                                Is money saved in the Fund safe?

Yes. The safety of the Fund is in its highly diversified portfolio, managed by professionals and a dedicated Board of Trustees. Not once in the history of the Fund have account balances ever gone down nor have annuity payments ever been missed. The Fund’s plans are designed in such a way that minimizes the risk of investment loss to the participant.

                                                What is ERISA and does the YMCA Retirement Plan follow the ERISA rules?

The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) was passed to protect employee pensions in response to some spectacular company failures in the 1960's, most notably the Studebaker automobile company. They had failed to put aside sufficient money to pay pensions if they went out of business and, when they did, all their retirees lost their pensions. This federal law requires certain standards for participation, enrollment, vesting and benefit payments. It also requires that the people who manage a pension plan (fiduciaries) meet certain standards.  The law generally classifies pension plans into three groups: company plans, government plans and church plans. There are different rules for each of these. It also classifies plans as defined benefit (formula) or defined contribution (individual account). Plans created before ERISA was enacted may not fall clearly into one of these categories.  Although church pension plans are not subject to ERISA, the YMCA Retirement Plan elected to become subject to ERISA in connection with the 2004 legislation confirming its status as a church pension plan.

The Fund offers retirement benefits to Y employees who become permanently and totally disabled. That means if an individual is incapable of working for a living, and their condition is not expected to improve, they may be eligible to receive an annuity from the Fund. To qualify for this benefit, the employee must:   be under age 60    have had at least five full years of participation in the Retirement Plan   have become disabled while working for a participating Y   have not taken a withdrawal from their YMCA Account and Personal Account (for Ys that require employee contributions) since leaving a Y   apply for benefits within six months after terminating Y employment    As the Fund’s total & permanent disability claims administrator, Liberty Mutual Group reviews all applications and renders a decision on claims.

                                                Why is it important to designate a beneficiary?

Designating a beneficiary means telling the Fund how to pay out death benefits. It is important that all Fund participants keep their beneficiary designations up-to-date so that their benefits are paid according to their wishes. To designate or update beneficiaries, a participant can either log onto their account and make the change online, or submit a Designation of Beneficiary form to the Fund. If at any time there is a major change in a participant’s life, such as marriage, birth of a child, widowhood or a divorce, they should review their beneficiary designation and make any necessary changes. If a participant dies before retirement without designating a beneficiary, as long as they have been married one year or longer, their surviving spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of their pre-retirement benefit unless she/he decides to waive this benefit. (If a spouse of an active participant waived this benefit prior to the participant attaining age 35, a new waiver must be submitted to the Fund. Otherwise, the spouse will automatically be entitled to 50% of the pre-retirement death benefit.)  The remaining pre-retirement benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the participant, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the participant, then to each of them in equal shares.

                                                What happens if a retiree does not designate a beneficiary?

If a retiree dies without designating a beneficiary, or if the beneficiary they named predeceased them and they did not submit a new Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit form to designate another, their Retired Death Benefit will be payable to the following, in order:   a) their estate, and if no estate is established or it is terminated before payment, then to  b) their children in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  c) their parents in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  d) their siblings in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  e) their nieces and nephews in equal shares, and if none survive the retiree, then to  f) their nearest living next-of-kin, and if there are more than one with the same degree of relationship to the retiree, then to each of them in equal shares. 
Print


 

                                                How does a participant change their beneficiary?

Participants can change their beneficiary at any time. Those who have not yet started their annuity can designate and update their beneficiaries online.  They may also designate their beneficiaries by submitting the proper form to the Fund. The form they use depends on whether or not they still work for the Y. The Designation of Beneficiary—for current Y Employees must be either notarized or signed by HR. The Designation of Beneficiary—for former Y Employees must be notarized.  For participants who have already started their annuity, the Designation of Beneficiary for the Retired Death Benefit must be notarized and mailed in. (Contact the Fund if an annuity has been started under the Principal Guarantee Annuity Option.)  NOTE: Federal law imposes strict rules for married employees designating beneficiaries other than their spouses. The employee must have notarized consent from their spouse if the spouse is not the only beneficiary.

                                                What happens if a participant dies while still working for a Y?

Their beneficiary will receive the greater of $10,000 or the sum of the amounts in their Personal Account, YMCA Account (Legacy) and YMCA Account. Any voluntary accounts they have will be paid to their beneficiary as well. All benefits will be paid as either a withdrawal or an annuity.
Print


 

                                                Who can be named as a beneficiary?

Anyone or any entity can be named as a beneficiary. Generally, all people named as beneficiaries get the same choices regarding benefits. However, since estates, trusts, Ys and other organizations do not have a life expectancy, they may only take a withdrawal and are not entitled to an annuity.  Married participants need notarized consent from their spouse if they do not name their spouse as their only primary beneficiary.

                                                If a participant has accounts in the Retirement Plan and Saving Plan, can they designate different beneficiaries for each plan?

Before retirement, a participant’s beneficiary designation will apply to both plans.   At retirement, they have the option to separately annuitize the plans. A beneficiary designation is necessary for the plan that is left at the Fund. If the Savings Plan is left at the Fund and the Retirement Plan is annuitized, they can designate beneficiaries for the Savings Plan and select separate beneficiaries for the Retirement Plan’s Retired Death Benefit.    Also, if they decide to annuitize the plans separately, they may designate different survivors (if they select the Joint & Survivor Annuity options) for each plan.

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

During each of the 12-month periods beginning on July 31, 2014 and July 31, 2015, she accumulated well over 1,000 hours between her two Y jobs. She was enrolled in the Retirement Plan on August 1, 2016.  Example: Nick, age 36, was hired on February 15, 2015. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on February 15, 2015. From February 15, 2016 to November 30, 2016 he completed another 1,000 hours before leaving his Y. On December 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y. Because Nick had met the eligibility and age requirements already, his new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on March 1, 2017, the first of the month following his original date of hire.  Example: Gary, age 50, was hired on May 15, 2014. He worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on May 15, 2014. From May 15, 2015 to August 31, 2015, he worked 500 hours before leaving his Y. On January 1, 2016, he was hired by another participating Y and worked 500 hours from January 1 to May 14, 2016. His new Y employer enrolled him in the Retirement Plan on June 1, 2016, the first of the month following his original date of hire. Example: Lydia, age 39, was hired on July 1, 2014. She worked 1,000 hours in the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 2014. From July 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016 she completed another 1,000 hours before leaving her Y.

There are certain legitimate situations where an individual may become re-employed by a Y after he or she begins receiving a lifetime annuity, or has taken a lump sum distribution from the Fund. Whether they are hired by any Y in the future is entirely at the discretion of the employing Y. In order to avoid potential problems, it is recommended that the retiree and Y discuss specific situations with their legal counsels and secure written legal opinions prior to taking any action.  Here are two examples of acceptable situations:    Jerry retired as a Branch Executive Director and began collecting his retirement benefit. Negotiations with his replacement fell through, and subsequently the Board asked him to return as the Branch Executive in an interim capacity while a new search is undertaken.    Mary retired as Secretary of the Membership Department and began collecting her retirement benefit. After gardening and fixing up her home for six months, she became bored, applied for and was accepted for a part-time position in the development office at another Y.    George terminated his Y employment because he was relocating from his hometown to another state to be closer to his sister. He applied for and received a lump sum distribution from the Retirement Plan. Six months later, George and his sister were not getting along so he moved back to his hometown, applied for and was accepted for another position at the Y.   Here are two examples of unacceptable situations:    A very difficult personal situation necessitated that Brad find a way to add to his household income. Accordingly, he arranged with his supervisor that he would retire, begin collecting his retirement benefit then be rehired to his existing job.    Lucy was all set to retire as the CEO, but the Board had not yet found her replacement. The Board asked her to stay on for three extra months while they extended their search. She agreed, with the understanding that she would continue earning her salary and also start her retirement annuity   Because Robin needed money to pay off her bills, she arranged with her supervisor that she would terminate employment, take a distribution from the Fund then be rehired to her existing job.

Although church pension plans are not subject to ERISA, the YMCA Retirement Plan elected to become subject to ERISA in connection with the 2004 legislation confirming its status as a church pension plan.

                                                Is enrollment in the Retirement Plan optional?

No, individuals employed at Ys that participate in the Fund's retirement plans must be enrolled in the Retirement Plan as soon as they are eligible, as a condition of employment, regardless of financial hardship. Only new employees hired for the first time by a Y after age 60, who are working for a Y that requires employees to make contributions, may elect to waive participation. These employees must complete a Waiver of Participation.

                                A PeopleClaim letter-rating represents our opinion of a company’s reliability based
                                on, among other factors, their response to complaints filed by PeopleClaim users.
                                Higher ratings generally reflect a history of constructively responding to all complaints
                                filed through our system, or no history of claims filed against the company through
                                PeopleClaim. See Terms of Use
                                for full details.

                                WeCare is PeopleClaim's business-friendly interactive profile that lets you connect
                                with customers and resolve their problems. Turn lemons to lemonade: if a complaint
                                posts and you resolve the problem, the complaint is removed and the customer is
                                asked to leave a positive comment. WeCare subscribers get advance notice when a
                                negative comment is submitted, plus a quarantine period before it posts – time to
                                make contact and resolve the problem, so the complaint never posts. And there's
                                more.
