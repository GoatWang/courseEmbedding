LICENSING


COMPANY OVERVIEW


Founded in New York in 1990 by three scientists at IBM’s laboratory at Yorktown Heights, Tessera originally focused on the research and development of semiconductor packaging technology.
As the company grew and evolved, Tessera formed a subsidiary called Invensas, an innovator in next-generation semiconductor and packaging technologies. Tessera also expanded its business through the acquisition of FotoNation, a leader in image and video enhancement and analysis.
Collectively known as “Tessera Holding Corp,” these companies have generated more than $2 billion in revenue since its November 2003 IPO.
In the fall of 2016, Tessera announced their acquisition of DTS Inc, and in early 2017 relaunched as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Xperi (XPER).

Tessera Technologies Inc.



07/11/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 07/11/2016 06:03
Invensas and Jabil Collaborate to Qualify BVA® Technology for Future Products








        SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Tessera Technologies, Inc. (Nasdaq:TSRA), announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary Invensas Corporation and Jabil (NYSE: JBL), one of the world's leading design and manufacturing product solution providers, have completed the first phase of qualification of Invensas Bond-Via-Array™ (BVA®) interconnect technology.
      

        'BVA is a proven high density, 3D interconnect technology for Package-on-Package (PoP) and System-in-Package (SiP) applications,' said Craig Mitchell, president, Invensas. 'As an established leader in the manufacture of a diverse array of electronic products, Jabil's identification of BVA as the benchmark for fine pitch package stacking is yet another validation of the value that this technology brings to the industry.'
      

        Jabil's interest stems from a desire to address customer requirements to mount fine pitch stacked packages to printed circuit boards (PCBs) with high yield and high throughput. In order to optimize the PCB assembly process of BVA-based packages for high volume production and ensure a complete manufacturing ecosystem, Jabil will also collaborate with Fuji Machine Mfg. Co., Ltd., a leading provider of surface mount technology equipment. The two companies are well suited to make significant contributions in the form of novel and proprietary PCB assembly processes.
      

        'Invensas BVA technology is a low-cost, versatile package stacking solution that is capable of scaling to very fine pitch,' said Dan Gamota, vice president of strategic capabilities, Jabil. 'At Jabil, we expect such innovative packaging solutions, and our ability to assemble them to PCBs, will be required to address the demand for ever increasing performance and functionality in future customer products. We look forward to continuing to work with Invensas as we explore uses of this important technology.'
      

        Invensas BVA technology provides the industry with a scalable package stacking platform that leverages existing manufacturing infrastructure while delivering unmatched tolerance to process variations; this translates into improved yield and cost efficiencies. The technology can be used to provide cost effective 3D interconnect solutions for Package-on-Package (PoP), System-in-Package (SiP) and a range of other packaging applications. For more information on Invensas BVA technology and other Invensas solutions, please visit www.invensas.com or www.tessera.com.

Key Tessera Patent Infringed across Broadcom Product Lines




ITC Win is Tessera’s Third Major Favorable Decision Against 
      Broadcom in Four Months






July 05, 2017 06:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Tessera Technologies, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries 
      (collectively, “Tessera,” a subsidiary of Xperi Corporation (NASDAQ: 
      XPER) (the “Company”)), confirmed more details today on its significant 
      win against Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”) and certain of its 
      customers in the U.S. International Trade Commission (“ITC”). 
      Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) Sandra Dee Lord issued a notice of 
      initial determination (“ID”) on June 30, 2017, and the Company’s counsel 
      has now received the full ID and confirmed the broad scope of Tessera’s 
      victory.
    

      “We are very pleased with this result, which our counsel has confirmed 
      is a complete victory on the ‘946 Patent,” said Jon Kirchner, the 
      Company’s CEO, referring to U.S. Patent No. 6,849,946 (the “‘946 
      Patent”). “The ALJ found that the ‘946 Patent is infringed, valid, and 
      has a domestic industry in the United States. This is a key patent on a 
      fundamental manufacturing process technology that is not only very 
      broadly infringed across all of Broadcom’s significant product lines, 
      but, we believe, is used by many others in the semiconductor industry.”
    

      The infringing Broadcom products are semiconductor chips that fall into 
      one of seven technology nodes: 16nm, 20nm, 28nm, 45/40nm, 65/60/55nm, 
      90nm, and 130nm. The ‘946 Patent covers the largest number of Broadcom 
      products of all three patents at issue in the ITC investigation.
    

      This is the second time that the ‘946 Patent’s validity has been 
      confirmed in the past four months – first by the Patent Trial and 
      Appeals Board when it denied Broadcom’s petition for Inter Partes Review 
      (“IPR”) in March, and now by the ITC. This patent is also at issue in 
      the Company’s parallel lawsuits against Broadcom and Avago in Delaware 
      federal district court, where the Company is seeking damages.
    

      The ALJ also recommended that the ITC issue its standard remedies that 
      would bar Broadcom and its customers Arista Networks, ARRIS/Pace, 
      ASUSTeK/ASUS, Comcast Cable, HTC, NETGEAR, and Technicolor from 
      importing, selling, and engaging in a variety of related domestic 
      activity in connection with infringing imported products. The infringing 
      products include a very wide array of Broadcom chips and the products 
      that incorporate them, such as set-top boxes, routers, modems, gateways, 
      cell phones and other mobile devices, as well as Ethernet switches and 
      other chips designed for data centers, enterprises, and cloud computing 
      servers. The case is now subject to review by the ITC Commissioners.
    

      “We are also pleased by the ALJ’s ruling that the ‘136 Patent is 
      infringed and valid,” Kirchner added, referring to U.S. Patent No. 
      6,133,136 (the “‘136 Patent”). “This is the second time this patented 
      technology has been found to be infringed by Broadcom – first by a court 
      in Germany and now by the ITC. And now the validity of the patent has 
      also been confirmed. Although the ALJ found that the ‘136 lacked a 
      domestic industry, that is a special requirement unique to the ITC that 
      does not apply in federal district court or in Europe, where the Company 
      has parallel cases against Broadcom.”
    

      “Broadcom has now been found to infringe multiple patents in multiple 
      jurisdictions – two of our U.S. patents and one of our E.U. patents. The 
      ITC decision is our third major favorable decision against Broadcom in 
      the past four months, along with the German infringement ruling and the 
      IPR decision on the ‘946 Patent. We remain interested in negotiating a 
      fair and reasonable license with Broadcom, but absent a satisfactory 
      resolution, we will continue to defend our IP rights and enforce these 
      decisions to the fullest extent of the law,” Kirchner concluded.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
