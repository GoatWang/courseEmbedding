            Budgeting is Like Dieting

Lots of room for failure, but we are going to share a few tips...

I was a top producer and instead of wishing me well after being forced out of the company they decided to sue me with out any merit. I have now discovered this is a common tactic trying to preserve the business and drive their former reps into bankruptcy or settle with unreasonable demands. In my opinion Valic product has high internal fees, long surrender charges and poor performance. They pressure their advisors to sell in house product or coerce them with fancy trips. In my opinion they have little concern for the client and only for their corporate bottom line. A good example of this is the current fine they just received from FINERA for 1.75 million. National they keep loosing large group cases because of poor product or poor service. If you google their history of law suites its impressive the individuals, states and cities that have filed complaints.Advice to ManagementTry and have the customer in mind and start providing good service and product. Treat people with respect, you do not own the rep or customer and they should have the right to make their own choices without using economic might to destroy families.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) VALIC Response seconds agoEdit • Delete VALIC 2017-01-26 05:44 PSTOther Employee Reviews for VALIC Jan 24, 2017 Helpful (1)"Financial advisor"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Financial AdvisorCurrent Employee - Financial AdvisorDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at VALIC full-time (More than 3 years)ProsPayed training, paid licenses and a book of business. No others pros, but I need to make Glass door 20 word requirement.ConsOnce through your book of business, there is nothing left. I was one of the top in District sales last year and not a single client was added to my book. In other words: I exceeded my goal and the companies goal and received 0 new clients! Clearly, successful agents are not valued by this company.Two other top salespeople left the company in the last 6 months. There is $0 salary and no compensation for driving. And the job requires you to drive hours per day. I estimate with wear and tear on my car I spent $4,000 last year out of pocket!Not compensated to sit in schools and there typically no enrollments. Even if you get enrollments they have to contribute a certain amount every 2 weeks in order for advisor to be compensated.Encouraged to work as a team, but there is no compensation to do so. Encouraged to handle paperwork for clients, again without any compensation.Management claims you will receive flow from clients. It is so small you will not even receive a pay check after taxes are deducted. So again, sales have to be made every week, other you get no check!Most offices are remote. VALIC will not provide ink for printing and there is a lot of printing.Annuity sales pushed by the company and annuities are definitely not right for most clients.Advice to ManagementAdvisors need a base salary. This is not the Stone Age. You are using Advisors and taking money from their pockets to pay your companies own expenses.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) VALIC Response seconds agoEdit • Delete VALIC 2017-01-24 06:54 PST Dec 31, 2016 Helpful (2)"Good role, bad compensation model"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOProsFlexibility in schedule, access to established groups, nice 401k match, option of ROTH 401k, call center team to schedule meetings on your behalf.ConsLow base salary that goes away after your first year.Advice to ManagementAdvisors do a lot of service work for your groups between closing new business. Compensate your advisors with a competitive base salary that does not disappear after the first year.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

          Benefits of Saving Now
        





Why should you enroll in a retirement plan or contribute to an IRA?
Did you know…
That retirement can last for 30 years or more?
That a common rule to follow is that a retiree will need up to 80% of his/her annual income today to retire comfortably?
That the average benefit amount paid monthly by the Social Security Administration is $1,177?
