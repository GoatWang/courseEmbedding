T. Jay Collins, President and CEO of Oceaneering, to Step Down in May 2011 (USA) | Offshore Energy Today




























































































Offshore Energy Today















T. Jay Collins, President and CEO of Oceaneering, to Step Down in May 2011 (USA) 

 
Oceaneering International, Inc.  announced that T. Jay Collins will retire from his position as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) immediately following the 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, which is scheduled to be held on May 6, 2011. M. Kevin McEvoy, Oceaneering’s Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, has been designated to succeed Mr. Collins as President and CEO.
Mr. McEvoy has been with Oceaneering for 32 years, serving since late February 2010 in his current position. He started his offshore career as an officer in the U.S. Navy working in the areas of diving, salvage, and submarine rescue. During his tenure at Oceaneering, he has held a variety of progressively more responsible domestic and international positions in marketing, administration, and operations.
T. Jay Collins stated, “I am very pleased to turn over the executive leadership of Oceaneering to such a qualified and experienced individual as Kevin, who I have worked with since I joined the company in 1993. I am confident he will continue to manage and plan for the growth of Oceaneering and am positive our business strategy of focusing on deepwater services and products will continue to prosper under his direction.”
Mr. Collins will stand for re-election as a Class I Director at Oceaneering’s May 2011 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. It is anticipated that concurrent with Mr. McEvoy’s appointment as President and CEO after the Annual Meeting of Shareholders, Oceaneering’s Board will also add him as a Class II Director.

        CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECHICAGO — One of the first indicators of who NBA teams are considering for the draft can be inferred at the annual combine.The Indiana Pacers have several needs heading into the June 22 draft. Their roster needs to get younger. They need consistent shooters. They need mobile, versatile players in a league where the demand has never been higher.Kevin Pritchard, the Pacers’ new team president, understands this. Pritchard, along with new adviser Larry Bird, coach Nate McMillan and director of scouting Ryan Carr, spent most of Wednesday and Thursday morning interviewing nine prospects. Two of the most intriguing players interviewed were Wake Forest’s John Collins and UCLA’s T.J. Leaf.Both fit the modern requirements for a power forward. Collins is 6-9, with a 6-11 wingspan, and 225 pounds. Leaf also is 6-9 with a 6-11 wingspan, and weighs 222 pounds. Both prospects are known for their fluid play, athleticism and ability to make a jumper.And similar to many players ready to join the NBA, Collins and Leaf were eager Thursday to share details about their meetings with the Pacers.“It was their willingness to work with me and willingness to welcome people into their organization,” Collins said on what impressed him about the Pacers. “They let players know that they are a legendary organization and that big things come from Indiana. They have (Paul George) and Myles Turner, so they have two really solid building blocks to go off of. I think that’s really good and they were in the playoffs.”Leaf added: “Kevin Pritchard is a great guy. I look forward to just getting to know them a little bit more. I think most likely I’ll probably head out there (for a workout).”UCLA Bruins forward TJ Leaf (22) dunks the ball against the Cincinnati Bearcats during the second round of the 2017 NCAA tournament at Golden 1 Center. (Photo: Kelley L Cox, USA TODAY Sports)In the first round, the Pacers possesses the 18th overall pick. Several mock draft boards — including DraftExpress.com, HoopsHype.com and CBSSports.com — have Collins and Leaf being selected in the middle of the first round. Jeff Goodman, a draft analyst for ESPN, said in a conference call Tuesday that Leaf could be available for Indiana.“I would say they’re important,” Pritchard said of interviewing prospects. “They’re not the most important, but I like getting a feel for what a player is like. What are they off the court? What’s important to them? Are they obsessed about being a good basketball player? Do they have good balance? Do they kind of just play basketball for the heck of it? I want to know that because it really helps you understand whether there’s fit because the NBA has gotten a lot better the last 10 years of evaluating talent with analytics. So now it really comes down to does the personality fit?”The power forward position was a tenuous one for the Pacers last season. McMillan never had a suitable backup behind veteran Thaddeus Young. The issue became glaring when Young sustained a sprained left wrist injury that nagged him — and sapped his ability to shoot from the perimeter — in the second half the season. The Pacers lost six consecutive games soon after Young’s injury, and opponents continued to expose the team’s lack of mobility at the position. The Pacers have the option on the final year of Lavoy Allen’s contract and Kevin Seraphin excelled more last season as the backup center.Insider: Pritchard, Bird continue to work together through draft, free agencyThe Pacers, according to a league source, wanted to interview Collins and Leaf because they were impressed with how both players showed a consistent work ethic that helped their improvement throughout their college careers. Collins, 19, returned to school for his sophomore year and led the Demon Deacons to the NCAA tournament last season, averaging 19.2 points and 9.8 rebounds per game. In learning from coach Danny Manning, a former NBA player, Collins said he became more proficient by developing better positioning in the post, improving his conditioning and learning how to better use his body as a screen-and-roll player.“I went from not playing that much to a significant starter,” Collins said of his transformation. “To see myself grow into handling that leadership role was great. In that extra year, coach put a lot of trust and faith in me. I had to put in a lot of work and I did my best to prepare myself for that role last year.”Leaf, 20, helped lead the Bruins to the Sweet 16, averaging 16.3 points and 8.2 rebounds per game as a freshman.The Pacers, according to the source, identified Collins and Leaf as intelligent players who are capable of grasping every aspect of a team’s playbook and defensive principles. Last year, Pritchard referenced Georges Niang’s high basketball IQ when the Pacers selected him the second round. Pritchard wants to continue to add better-than-average thinkers to the Pacers’ roster.Leaf said he benefited intellectually last season from playing alongside Lonzo Ball, who many consider a top-three pick.“I feel my IQ is very high,” Leaf said. “Playing with Lonzo, me and him both had very high IQs and I think it helped. I think we grew off of each other and learned things from each other that we really didn’t know about the game of basketball.”Ex-UCLA teammate T.J. Leaf close with Lonzo Ball but not buying his shoesCollins and Leaf each identified the same skill they want show teams throughout the predraft period: consistent perimeter shooting. Both players are aware they will better their chances of convincing a team to select them in the first round if they enhance their shooting mechanics.“I think I can score on three levels, which a lot of bigs are not able to do,” Leaf said, who shot 46.6 percent last season.Collins attempted just one 3-pointer last season, but he produced impressive shooting statistics in Thursday’s individual workouts. Collins shot 80 percent from the right and left corner on spot-up shooting. He shot 100 percent from the top of the key.“I think I can shoot it a lot better than I’ve shown,” Collins said. “I’m definitely going to keep working on that and expanding (my range), so that when the time is necessary for me to shoot it I’m looking good doing it.”First team workout MondayThe Pacers announced Friday their first pre-draft workout will be Monday. The six prospects who are scheduled to participate are Jordan Bell (Oregon), Josh Hart (Villanova), Wesley Iwundu (Kansas State), Monte Morris (Iowa State), Caleb Swanigan (Purdue) and Derrick White (Colorado).Call IndyStar reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
