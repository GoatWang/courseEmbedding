     Outstanding Shares 782,541,311 a/o May 15, 2017      NuState Energy Holdings, Inc.    http://nsehinc.com/  Contact information: 1201 Main Street Suite 1980 Columbia, SC 29201 Phone: 945-712-7487 Email: info@nsehinc.com   Twitter: @NSEHINC Facebook Page About NuState Energy Holdings, Inc.:   NuState is a provider of vehicle telematics solutions to the Consumer, Small Medium Business and Enterprise industries. GPSTrax was created from years of development experience and proprietary algorithms. GPSTrax connects to the vehicle’s computer allowing communication to all of the vehicle sensors for real-time data collection.  GPSTrax has proven to enhance worldwide emission reduction solutions for the automobile and trucking industry. GPSTrax collects and synthesizes the data for carbon credit capture. GPSTrax is the universal technology that turns any vehicle into a smart and environmentally friendly vehicle. For more information about NuState, call (954) 712-7487 or visit our web site www.nsehinc.com. NuState is located at 410 East Las Olas Blvd Suite 1400 Fort Lauderdale, Florida 33301   MANAGEMENT TEAM President/CEO: Kathy Roberton  (linkedin) Chairman, CFO: Kevin Yates (Profile) Vice President: Bruce Ross (Profile)   Company Overview via Bloomberg Business    GPSTrax  The Company’s telematics solutions collect vehicle and container-based data, integrate it with information gathered from various separate systems across the supply chain, synthesize it, reformat it into valuable, actionable information, and deliver it to end-users across the logistics value chain through secure web-based applications. Specific offerings include vehicle tracking, inventory/asset visibility, secure trucking, matching available freight with available trucks, and many others. In addition, through NSEH Environmental Solutions, the Company has adapted its product to provide critical information enabling verification of fuel savings and reduction of harmful emissions. The software is “hardware agnostic” – having the unique capability of interfacing with any hardware.   Key Features of GPSTrax include  Tracking Notification In or Out Skybitz Integration Geofencing Adjustable 1 Minute Breadcrumbs Google Map Integration Fuel Efficiency 3rd Party Validation Tool Driver Habits & Patterns Speed Monitoring Mpg Analysis Fuel Savings/ Predictions Alerts & Notifications Speed Alerts Geofencing Alerts Temperature Alerts Emergency / Panic Button Alerts Door Open Alerts  Security Radius Proximity Geofence Polygon Geofence or Corridor Door Sensors Fuel Cap Sensor Emergency / Panic Button Safety Engine ECM Fault Reporting Speed Alerts Trailer Tracing Extended Battery Life Tracking Maintenance Reminders Reporting ECM Daily Metrics Idle / Stationary Daily Reports State Mileage Reports Historical Geofence Crossing Reports Historical Ecm Fault Reporting Road Type Reporting Fuel Transactions Unauthorized Miles / Dead Head Miles Emission Credits Baseline Recording And Validation Product Introduction Product Validation Interfaces EDI Capability X12 Standard TCH Fuel Transactions (flat ANSI file) and XML Skybitz (flat ANSI file) Telematics JBus 1708 ECM Remote Diagnostics Odometer Readings Refrigerated 3 Zone Temperature Sensors 1 Way Text Messaging 2 Way Terminal Mounted in Cab Communications Mobile Phone Application / Task Load Assignment Signature Capture Driver Exception Reporting   NSEH Environmental Solutions  Emission Reduction Monitoring and Carbon Credit Capture NSEH Emission Reduction Monitoring Solutions (ERMS) bring about fleet carbon neutrality and overall improvements in productivity and driver safety, representing significant value for commercial fleet management customers. Considering these benefits and the fact that the road transport industry alone is responsible for 18%* of global CO2 emissions, NSEH launched ERMS which further assists fleet customers in taking responsibility for their carbon footprint. Accelerating carbon credit creation for all carbon market participants through transparent, easy to use software. NSEH Environmental Solutions provides an integrated suite of software applications to manage, monitor, and monetize their emission reduction and sustainable energy projects. Our goal is to reduce the time, cost, and complexity of implementing projects. We host unique Software-as-a-Service products that empower participants to collaborate on a secure multi-party platform.        Benefit Statement GPSTrax is the universal technology that turns any car into a ‘smart car”   How it Works Our technology works on any car manufactured since 1996 allowing us to access car sensors through the government-mandated open OBDII port.   GPSTrax relies on low-cost hardware that can be purchased at any number of manufactures and can be easily self-installed under the dashboard and paired via Bluetooth/WiFi to a smartphone, storing data in the cloud.   Competitors There are four start-up companies (Automatic, Zubie, Mojio, and Dash) with similar platforms that have collectively raised over $150M from Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley. Each of the four have similar business models. The companies are not differentiated in their platforms, underlying technology or focus.   NuState’s Edge Automatic, Zubie, Mojio, and Dash all focus on basic Smart Car technology. OnStar is a proprietary technology used only on cars that GM produces and a few “after-market” cars they sell.   FOCUS sets NuState apart. While GPSTrax can do everything the competition can do and more, our FOCUS is different. Also, OnStar is proprietary to GM, GPSTrax can work on ANY car 1996 or newer, almost anywhere in the world.   FOCUSED MARKET SEGMENTS: Smart Car Technology The Kyoto Protocol & Merc – Established Market The Internet of Things “IOT” – Massive Market     Smart Car Technology: The GPSTrax adapter plugs into just about any car which unlocks the data hidden in a car’s onboard computer. The free mobile app pairs with the adapter via Bluetooth to diagnose engine problems, display trip logs and mileage and even call for help in a crash. In addition, the basic alerts such as engine light diagnostics, time and location triggers, parts and labor estimator. MPG analytics and ways to reduce gas costs, trip tracking and more!   The Kyoto Protocol & MERC  The Kyoto Protocol adapted by the United Nations and is a trading system that essentially makes carbon credits a commodity like oil or gas on a worldwide scale. MERC is the process of converting the mobile emissions reduction into a tradable commodity that consists of converting the reduction or a portion of the reduction of emissions into at least one tradable credit then marketing and monetizing the credit. GPSTrax is the only software solution that focuses on this market sector.   NuState is poised to move into markets via our licensing agreement with The Ronn Motor Group, our first partner in this segment. Through our exclusive licensing agreement with RMG, Ronn Maxwell, CEO of Ronn Motor Groups is targeting the commercial and original equipment fleet vehicle markets in China, India, and Europe. According to Ronn Maxwell “GPSTrax is an important tool for validating, testing, and trucking or stationary platform.”   The Internet of Things (IOT) IOT, arguably NuState’s largest sector, is the “network of physical objects or things” embedded with electronics, software, sensors, and connectivity to enable objects to exchange data. GPSTrax has a proprietary algorithm which uses a variety of driver safety/efficiency metrics to generate valuable data that is stored in the Cloud. This can be compared to Google or Facebook with the only difference being the data is specific to the automotive aftermarket which is projected to be 85.5 Billion Dollars in 2016 (just in the U.S.!)   Experts agree that the total IOT could add U.S. 10.6 Trillion Dollars in accumulative GDP for several economies over the next 15 years. GPSTrax is on the forefront, worldwide, accumulative marketable data. Through telematics, NuState has significant potential to offer predictive, timely, contextual, convenient and simple data to the automotive aftermarket service providers worldwide.   According to Gartner, 250 million connected vehicles will enable new in-vehicles services and automate driving capabilities by 2020, making connected cars one of the largest and most valuable segments of the Internet of Things (IOT).   Nustate’s team has more experience than the other four companies regarding fleet management, emission tricking, fuel efficiency, and most importantly offers an inside opportunity for the Smart Investor not sitting in Silicon Valley!

NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. Launches New Website For Consumer And Investor Appeal






GlobeNewswire



Feb 7, 2017 8:30 AM EST













 


















































 Fort Lauderdale, Feb. 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. (NSEH -OTC US) has launched a new website for investors and consumers alike, including new branding and updates to reflect the company's current strategy, holdings, and goals moving forward.  The new website contains some information on the company's flagship product GPSTrax, which is currently subject to industrial attention from Chinese partners. The technology can help turn any car into a smart car, and can help improve fuel efficiency by providing useful driving analytics. More information will be added to the site including an e-commerce section for ordering products.  NuState's new website allows interested distributors to request information very simply. Due to the site's sharing of information and easy contact form, the company expects to be able to appeal to a broader range of investors and business partners than ever before in 2017.  In addition to the new sales channel and the brand equity buildup that will follow, the new site will allow for more open communication between the company and its shareholders, which will increase transparency. This couldn't come at a better time, with so many developments expected in 2017.  "We are thrilled to be able to get our unique and innovative products into more vehicles through our new website," said CEO Kevin Yates, "We think 2017 will be our breakout year, and we are happy to have an efficient medium to communicate our exciting progress to all of our stakeholders as well."   About NuState Energy Holdings, Inc.:   NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. is a true green technology holding company based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. NuState's management has placed strong emphasis on acquiring, developing, and commercializing efficiency-bolstering software solutions in the automotive industry. For over 15 years, the company has managed a web-based collaborative marketplace for freight transportation and secure trucking. More recently, the company branched out to work on a telematics solution with consumers in mind. The result: GPSTrax, an innovative solution that can turn nearly any passenger vehicle into a smart car, capable of reducing fuel consumption and emissions by learning from and optimizing around driving patterns. The company is currently licensing its technologies abroad, with hopes to expand sales and decrease hazardous vehicular emissions across the globe.

Stocks: 15 minute delay, EST. Futures and Forex: 10 minute delay, CST.) and new delayed trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash").  Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related ETFs Find exchange traded funds (ETFs) whose sector aligns with the same commodity grouping as the symbol you are viewing.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS





	DECEMBER
	31, 2016






	 






	NOTE
	1: ORGANIZATION, GOING CONCERN AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION





	 





	Organization





	 




	NuState
	Energy Holdings, Inc.

	,

	or the Company, currently is a Florida corporation that was incorporated in Nevada in October 1987.
	It was formerly known as Jaguar Investments, Inc. between October 1987 and May 2003, Power2Ship, Inc. between May 2003 and November
	2006, and Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. between November 2006 and December 2007.




	 





	Going
	Concern





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company had net cash used in operating activities
	of $84,746 during the six months ended December 31, 2016 and had a working capital deficit of approximately $5.0 million at December
	31, 2016.

	These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern.

	The Company’s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain
	the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come
	due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future. Management plans to provide for
	the Company’s capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters
	cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute
	its business plan or generate positive operating results.

	The financial statements do not
	include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	unaudited interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items,
	which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state NuState Energy Holdings, Inc.’s (the “Company”
	or “we”, “us” or “our”) financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the dates
	and periods presented and to make such information not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
	in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	have been omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), nevertheless,
	management of the Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.




	 




	These
	unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s audited financial statements for the year
	ended June 30, 2016, contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on October14, 2016. The
	results of operations for the six months ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for
	any other interim period or the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.




	 





	NOTE
	2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
	of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses
	during the reported period. Actual results will differ from those estimates. Included in these estimates are assumptions used
	in Black-Scholes valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend rate.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers all highly liquid, temporary, cash equivalents with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased,
	to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents during the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.




	 





	Concentration
	of Credit Risks





	 




	The
	Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk from cash.




	 




	The
	Company’s cash account is held at a financial institution and is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or
	FDIC, up to $250,000. During the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had not reached a bank balance exceeding
	the FDIC insurance limit.




	 





	Derivative
	Liabilities





	 




	The
	Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, which consist of
	convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company’s common stock, and determined that such derivatives meet the
	criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.




	 




	ASC
	815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
	and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
	the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic
	characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
	and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
	changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
	instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception
	to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	DECEMBER
	31, 2016





	 





	NOTE
	2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued





	 




	During
	the six months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had notes payable outstanding in which the conversion rate was variable
	and undeterminable. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a derivative liability in connection with such instruments. The Company
	uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance sheet thereafter
	and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument (e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton), the expected volatility,
	the implied risk free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate, if any.




	 





	Fair
	Value of Financial Instruments





	 




	The
	Company accounts, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair
	Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing
	generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring
	fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.




	 




	ASC
	820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
	the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:




	 






	Level
	1:




	Observable
	inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.





	 


	 





	Level
	2:




	Observable
	market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.





	 


	 





	Level
	3:




	Unobservable
	inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity’s own assumptions.






	 




	The
	Company’s derivative liability at December 31, 2015 and 2014 is classified as Level 3 financial instrument.




	 





	Additional
	Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements





	 




	The
	carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, other receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued compensation, note
	and convertible promissory notes payable, and liabilities from discontinued operations approximate their fair value due to the
	short maturity of these items.




	 





	Convertible
	Instruments





	 




	The
	Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
	from their host instruments) in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Accordingly, the Company records,
	when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based
	upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and
	the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
	related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion
	options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment
	date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.




	 




	ASC
	815-40, Contracts in Entity’s own Equity, generally provides that, among other things, if an event is not within the entity’s
	control, such contract could require net cash settlement and shall be classified as an asset or a liability.




	 




	The
	Company determines whether the instruments issued in the transactions are considered indexed to the Company’s own stock.
	During the fiscal year 2014 the Company issued convertible securities with variable conversion provisions that resulted in derivative
	liabilities.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which requires,
	among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
	the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
	the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
	tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.




	 




	The
	Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10, “Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions”. When tax returns
	are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
	while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be
	ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the
	financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than
	not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if
	any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not
	recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized
	upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions

	taken
	that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the
	accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities
	upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such,
	the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

	NOTES
	TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	DECEMBER
	31, 2016





	 





	NOTE
	2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued





	 





	Income
	Taxes, continued





	 




	The
	Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25,

	“

	Definition of Settlement”

	,

	which provides guidance on how an
	entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized
	tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing
	authority without being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the
	full amount of tax benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on
	the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open. As of December 31, 2015, the Company had not
	filed tax returns for the tax years ending June 30, 2008 through 2015 and such returns, when filed, potentially will be
	subject to audit by the taxing authorities for a minimum of three years beyond the filing date under the three-year statute
	of limitations. The Company has not accrued any potential tax penalties associated with not filing these tax returns. Due to
	recurring losses, management believes such potential tax penalties, in any, would not be material in amount.




	 





	Share-Based
	Payment





	 




	The
	Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Under
	the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
	fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the
	vesting period.




	 




	The
	Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its options, which
	incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to
	calculate the fair value of stock option awards. Compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards
	ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
	and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.




	 





	Segment
	Reporting





	 




	The
	Company operates in one segment, which is to search for possible acquisition targets and merge with an operating company. The
	Company’s chief operating decision-maker evaluates the performance of the Company based upon expenses by functional areas as disclosed
	in the Company’s statements of operations.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	Recent
	accounting pronouncements have been issued but deemed by management to be outside the scope of relevance to the Company.




	 




	As
	an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the exemption provided for in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act or JOBS
	Act allowing us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
	private companies until those standards apply to private companies pursuant to Section 102(b)(1) of the Act.

	Basic
	and Diluted Earnings Per Share





	 




	Basic
	earnings per share are calculated by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of
	Common Stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares
	of Common Stock and dilutive Common Stock share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive Common Stock share equivalents
	consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the modified-treasury stock method).  Potential
	common shares includable in the computation of fully-diluted per-share results are not presented in the financial statements as
	their affect would be anti-dilutive.

	NOTE 3: DERIVATIVE LIABILITY



	 


	The Company accounts for the embedded conversion
	features included in its convertible instruments as derivative liabilities. The aggregate fair value of derivative liabilities
	at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 amounted to $857,660 and $636,096, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2016
	and 2015, the Company recorded a loss related to the change in fair value of the derivative liability amounting to $123,247 and
	a gain of $21,755, respectively. At each measurement date, the fair value of the embedded conversion features was based on the
	Black-Scholes-Merton method using the following assumptions:

	NOTE 6: OBLIGATIONS TO ASC RECAP, LLC




	 



	In July, 2013, certain of the Company’s
	creditors showed interest in selling their claims against the Company to ASC Recap, LLC (“ASC”); this group also included
	both current and past management of the Company. This led to the Company signing a Liability Purchase Agreement with ASC on July
	23, 2013. This Agreement required the Company to issue common shares within five business days of each purchase at a 25% discount
	from the market price to ASC in amounts equal to the claims purchased from the Company’s creditors. In addition, under the
	terms of the Agreement, the Company issued a $25,000 non-interest bearing convertible promissory note to ASC, as described in Note
	4.


	 


	ASC signed a series of Claim Purchase Agreements
	with certain creditors of the Company to purchase their claims against the Company totaling $2,531,565. These claims consisted
	of notes payable, convertible notes payable, vendor payables and accrued compensation to the Company’s CEO and to a related
	party. The Claim Purchase Agreements required ASC to settle the creditors’ claims against the Company for a total of $1,305,996.
	Each Claim Purchase Agreement stipulated that ASC would pay each creditor the agreed-upon amount in up to twelve (12) monthly installments.


	 


	In January, 2014, the Company had not issued
	any shares to ASC as required by the agreement. As a result, ASC filed a complaint in Leon County, Florida demanding the prescribed
	issuance of shares from the Company for the purchased claims. A settlement agreement was reached on February 6, 2014, and on March
	12, 2014 ASC Recap filed a motion in Leon County, Florida which forced the Company to comply. ASC Recap was awarded a $2,531,565
	judgement which was to be paid by issuing free trading common stock at a 25% discount from the market price

	.

	In
	addition, on May 6, 2014, the Company issued a $125,000 non-interest bearing convertible promissory note to ASC, as described in
	Note 4. Between April and June of 2014, the Company issued to ASC 322,220,000 shares of common stock with an aggregate market value
	of $365,308, which reduced the recorded liability by $273,981; in July of 2014, the Company issued 82,980,000 shares of common
	stock with an aggregate market value of $24,894 (see Note 6).


	 


	On August 13, 2015 ASC Recap, LLC issued the
	Company a letter of default related to its agreement to settle outstanding liabilities and related accrued interest and returned
	approximately $2,373,000 of liabilities to their original holders, which is detailed in the table at the end of Note 6. These balances
	reflect the payments made by ASC to creditors prior to the default.


	 


	An analysis of the settlement liability due
	to ASC is as follows:

	NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	DECEMBER 31, 2016



	 



	NOTE 7: STOCKHOLDERS’ DEFICIT, continued



	 



	Preferred Stock



	 



	Series A Preferred Stock



	 


	The Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value
	of $0.25 per share. Each one share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into one (1) share of Common Stock. In the event
	the Common Stock price per share is lower than $0.10 (ten cents) per share then the Conversion shall be set at $0.035 per share.
	The Common Stock shares are governed by Lock-Up/Leak-Out Agreements. The Series A convertible preferred stock has a par value of
	$0.001.


	 



	Series B Preferred Stock



	 


	Thirty million (30,000,000) shares of preferred
	stock were designated as a new Series B Preferred stock in April, 2016. This new Series B Preferred Stock has a $0.001 par value,
	and each 300 shares is convertible into one share of the Company’s common stock, with a stated value of $375 per share. The
	Series B convertible preferred stock has a par value of $0.001.


	 


	The former Series A and B convertible preferred
	shares issued and outstanding, along with the Company’s preferred shares Series C, D, F, H. I, J, and Y were exchanged for
	shares of the current Series A preferred stock in November, 2015. These classes of shares were subsequently cancelled. Issued and
	outstanding shares of Series C, D, F, H, I, J, and Y of the Company’s preferred stock had a par value of $0.01 per share.
	All classes rank(ed) prior to any class or series of the Company’s common stock as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation,
	dissolution or winding up of the Company or as to the payment of dividends. All preferred stock shall have no voting rights except
	if the subject of such vote would reduce the amount payable to the holders of preferred stock upon liquidation or dissolution of
	the company and cancel and modify the conversion rights of the holders of preferred stock as defined in the certificate of designations
	of the respective series of preferred stock.


	 


	On October 14, 2015
	a former Chairman of the Board of the Company was issued 80 shares of Series F preferred stock with a stated value of $5,000 and
	a par value $0.001 per share, and 12 shares of Series H preferred stock, with a stated value of $1,000 and a par value $0.001 per
	share in consideration for his forgiveness of $412,000 in accrued compensation. Subsequently, in October 2015, these Series F and
	Series H shares were exchanged for 1,648,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.


	 


	On October 28, 2015,
	preferred shareholders representing a majority of each series of our outstanding preferred stock, voted to cancel all their shares
	of preferred stock in exchange for 11,181,340 shares of newly designated Series A preferred stock. The number of shares of newly
	issued Series A preferred stock issued to each preferred shareholder was calculated by dividing the total stated value of their
	preferred shares by $0.25. The holders of the Series A preferred shares are restricted from converting their shares to common stock
	for two years (the “Lock-Up Period”). After the Lock-Up Period, they may convert up to one percent of their Series
	A preferred shares into common shares on a one for one basis each month for four years (the “Leak-Out Period”). However,
	the conversion price automatically reduces by 86% to $0.035 per share if our common stock is below $0.10 per share. At the end
	of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred shares may be converted to common stock at the shareholders’
	discretion.

	In November, 2015, we sold 40,000 shares of
	Series A preferred stock to one investor for $10,000 and sold 100,000 shares of Series B preferred stock to another investor for
	$25,000.

	The agreement with i-BM has a term of twelve months. As part of the agreement, i-BM commits to invest $250,000 into the Company

	ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Results
	of Operations


	 



	The following discussion of our financial
	condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere
	in this report. Certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward-looking statements. See ‘‘Cautionary
	Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information’’ elsewhere in this report. Because this discussion involves risk and
	uncertainties, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements

	.




	 



	Overview



	 


	NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. is a technology
	company specializing in providing pertinent, real-time information to the worldwide transportation and security industries. NuState’s
	proprietary software, GPSTrax, is built on an Open Architecture platform for the logistics and telematics industries.


	 


	We believe there are many opportunities to
	leverage and monetize our software technology by licensing it to companies that provide green technology solutions to medium and
	large logistics companies. In November 2014, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. signed a definitive agreement with The Ronn Motor Group,
	with offices in Dalian, China and the United States, to license and market GPSTrax in China and other international markets.


	 


	NuState is launching a new GPSTrax Value-Added
	Reseller (VAR) Program, focusing on opportunities in consumer-based solutions such as asset tracking. The VAR Program will increase
	awareness, availability and support of the GPSTrax solution at a time when a growing number of companies are looking to update
	and optimize their solutions. We expect to generate revenues from this Program during fiscal 2017.


	 


	Our software technology provides validation
	and verification of fuel cost consumption reporting and fuel tax credits to logistics companies. The software also is designed
	to document the exact amount of reduction of harmful emissions that results from the alternative energy products. This data will
	enable users in certain countries to generate emissions credits that are tradable under the protocol of the Kyoto Treaty.


	 


	Through our existing relationships in the country
	of Suriname, NuState is evaluating several projects in the alternative renewable energy market in Suriname. NuState has been in
	discussions with AMPS, NV (“

	AMPS

	”), based in Paramaribo, Suriname, to enter into a license agreement with its
	partner, The Ronn Motor Group, in relation to the purchase of GPSTrax© for their multi-million-dollar alternative energy projects.
	AMPS focuses on providing engineering, procurement and construction management (EPC) services, Power Transmission & Distribution,
	Renewable and Conventional Energy as well as Power Management Systems to Suriname and its fellow Caribbean Community members.


	 


	We are unable to determine at this time whether
	we will be successful in capitalizing on the aforementioned opportunities in our business environment without proper funding.

	The increase in selling, general and administrative
	expenses during fiscal 2016, when compared with the prior year, is primarily due to an increase in stock -based compensation and
	accounting expense, offset by lower salaries and consulting fees.


	 


	We believe that our selling, general, and administrative
	expenses will continue at their current rate as we continue to focus our resources on the search for a business opportunity for
	the remainder of 2017. Should we begin merger or acquisition procedures, we believe that our selling, general, and administrative
	expenses will substantially increase.

	Gain on restructuring of debt




	 



	During the three and six months ended December

	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At December 31, 2016 and 2015, 100% of our
	total assets consisted of cash.


	 


	We do not have any material commitments for
	capital expenditures.


	 


	The objective of liquidity management is to
	ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments and effectively implement our growth strategy. Our primary
	sources are financing activities such as the issuance of notes payable and convertible notes payable. In the past, we have mostly
	relied on debt and equity financing to provide for our operating needs.


	 


	We cannot ascertain that we have sufficient
	funds from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements through June 30, 2017. We may need to raise funds to enhance our
	working capital and use them for strategic purposes. If such need arises, we intend to generate proceeds from either debt or equity
	financing.


	 


	We intend to finance our operations using a
	mix of equity and debt financing. We do not anticipate incurring capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We anticipate
	that we will need to raise approximately $180,000 per year in the near term to finance the recurring costs of being a publicly-traded
	company. In the long-term, we anticipate we will need to raise a substantial amount of capital to complete an acquisition. We are
	unable to quantify the resources we will need to successfully complete an acquisition. If these funds cannot be obtained, we may
	not be able to consummate an acquisition or merger, and our business may fail as a result.


	 


	During the six months ended December 31, 2015
	we have taken aggressive steps to strengthen the balance sheet by successfully exchanging debt held by our noteholders for shares
	of our Series A and Series B preferred stock at substantial discounts to the face value of the notes payable. We have been able
	to do this because the noteholders have agreed that this is a necessary step to provide the Company an opportunity to successfully
	execute on its business plan.


	 



	Going Concern



	 


	The accompanying financial statements have
	been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has used net cash in its operating activities of approximately $85,000 and
	$203,000 during the six-month periods ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has a working capital deficit of approximately
	$5.0 million and $4.5 million at December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The Company’s ability to continue as
	a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities
	arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations
	in the future, once a merger with an operating company is consummated. Management plans may continue to provide for its capital
	requirements by issuing additional equity securities and debt and the Company will continue to find possible acquisition target.
	The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that if achieved, the Company will have
	sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results.

	salaries to executives of $48,125, offset by the increase in cash paid for audit and related services of $18,080. This cash was

	salaries to executives of $52,609, and the increase in cash paid for audit and related services of $22,500. This cash was obtained

	as of December 31, 2016. The Convertible Notes Payable bear interest at rates ranging between 0% and 18% per annum. Interest is
	generally payable monthly. The Convertible Notes Payable are generally convertible at rates ranging between $0.00125 and $0.0005
	per share, at the holders’ option. December 31, 2016, all convertible promissory notes have matured, are in default, and

	Evaluation of disclosure
	controls and procedures

	. Our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) have
	evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e))
	as of the end of the period covered by the Quarterly Report (the “evaluation date’). They have concluded that, as of
	the evaluation date, these disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information
	required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
	reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.


	 



	Changes in internal
	control over financial reporting

	. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in
	connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during
	the Registrant’s last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
	control over financial reporting.



	 





	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
	Procedures




	 


	Our management, with the participation of our
	Chief Executive Officer, who is also our principal executive and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based
	upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures
	were not effective in ensuring that material information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
	Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms,
	including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.

	WHEREAS,
	Employer is desirous of employing Employee pursuant to the terms and conditions and for the consideration set forth in this Agreement,
	and;




	 




	WHEREAS,
	Employee is desirous of entering the employ of Employer pursuant to such terms and conditions and for such consideration as are
	listed below;




	 




	NOW,
	THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants, and obligations contained herein, Employer and Employee
	agree as follows:




	 





	ARTICLE
	1: EMPLOYMENT AND DUTIES

	:




	 




	1.1.       Employer
	agrees to employ Employee, and Employee agrees to be employed by Employer, beginning _as of the Effective Date and continuing
	until the date of termination of Employee’s employment pursuant to the provisions of Article 3 (the “Term”),
	subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.




	 




	1.2.
	Beginning as of the Effective Date, Employee shall be employed as CEO of Employer.


	Employee
	agrees to serve in the assigned position or in such other executive capacities as may be requested from time to time by Employer
	and to perform diligently and to the best of Employee’s abilities the duties and services appertaining to such position
	as reasonably determined by Employer, as well as




	such
	additional or different duties and services appropriate to such positions which Employee from time to time may be reasonably directed
	to perform by Employer.




	 




	1.3.       Employee

	1.4.       Employee
	shall, during the period of Employee’s employment by Employer, devote Employee’s necessary and sufficient business
	time, energy, and best efforts to the business and affairs of Employer. Employee may not engage, directly or indirectly, in any

	acknowledges and agrees that Employee owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty, fidelity and allegiance to act at all times in the best
	interests of the Employer and the other NuState Entities and to do no act which would, directly or indirectly, injure any such
	entity’s business, interests, or reputation. Itis agreed that any direct or indirect interest in, connection with, or benefit
	from any outside activities, particularly commercial activities, which interest might in any way adversely affect Employer, or
	any NuState Entity, involves a possible conflict of interest. In keeping with Employee’s fiduciary duties to Employer, Employee
	agrees that Employee shall not knowingly become involved in a conflict of interest with Employer or the NuState Entities, or upon
	discovery thereof, allow such a conflict to continue. Moreover, Employee shall not engage in any activity that might involve a

	for purposes of Article 3 hereof; provided, however, that, effective with such transfer, all of Employer’s obligations hereunder
	shall be assumed by and be binding upon, and all of Employer’s rights hereunder shall be assigned to, such Subsequent Employer
	and the defined term “Employer” as used herein shall thereafter be deemed amended to mean such Subsequent Employer.
	Except as otherwise provided above, all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation, Employee’s
	rights and obligations, shall remain in full force and effect following such transfer of employment

	in any such events, give prior notice to Employer of his intent to disclose any such confidential business information in such
	context so as to allow Employer or its affiliates an opportunity (which Employee will not oppose) to obtain such protective orders
	or similar relief with respect thereto as may be deemed appropriate.
