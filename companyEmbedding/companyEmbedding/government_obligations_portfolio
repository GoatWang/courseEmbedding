Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

 About risk
			 


Active Trading Risk. The Fund engages in frequent trading of portfolio securities. Active trading results in added expenses and may result in a lower return and increased tax liability.
Call Risk. If interest rates fall, it is possible that issuers of debt securities with high interest rates will prepay or call their securities before their maturity dates. In this event, the proceeds from the called securities would likely be reinvested by the Fund in securities bearing the new, lower interest rates, resulting in a possible decline in the Fund's income and distributions to shareholders.
Changing Fixed Income Market Conditions Risk. The current low interest rate environment was created in part by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) and certain foreign central banks keeping the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates at or near zero. There is a risk that interest rates will rise when the FRB and central banks raise these rates. This risk is heightened due to the "tapering" of the FRB's quantitative easing program and other similar foreign central bank actions. This tapering and eventual increase in the federal funds and equivalent foreign rates may expose fixed income markets to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity for certain fixed income investments, particularly those with longer maturities. In addition, decreases in fixed income dealer market-making capacity may also potentially lead to heightened volatility and reduced liquidity in the fixed income markets. As a result, the value of the Fund's investments and share price may decline. Changes in central bank policies could also result in higher than normal shareholder redemptions, which could potentially increase portfolio turnover and the Fund's transaction costs.
Collateralized Loan Obligations Risk. In addition to the normal interest rate, default and other risks of fixed income securities, collateralized loan obligations carry additional risks, including the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments, the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default, the Fund may invest in collateralized loan obligations that are subordinate to other classes, values may be volatile, and disputes with the issuer may produce unexpected investment results.
Credit Risk. The issuer of instruments in which the Fund invests may be unable to meet interest and/or principal payments, thereby causing its instruments to decrease in value and lowering the issuer's credit rating.
Derivatives Risk. The value of a derivative instrument depends largely on (and is derived from) the value of an underlying security, currency, commodity, interest rate, index or other asset (each referred to as an underlying asset). In addition to risks relating to the underlying assets, the use of derivatives may include other, possibly greater, risks, including counterparty, leverage and liquidity risks. Counterparty risk is the risk that the counterparty to the derivative contract will default on its obligation to pay the Fund the amount owed or otherwise perform under the derivative contract. Derivatives create leverage risk because they do not require payment up front equal to the economic exposure created by owning the derivative. As a result, an adverse change in the value of the underlying asset could result in the Fund sustaining a loss that is substantially greater than the amount invested in the derivative, which may make the Fund's returns more volatile and increase the risk of loss. Derivative instruments may also be less liquid than more traditional investments and the Fund may be unable to sell or close out its derivative positions at a desirable time or price. This risk may be more acute under adverse market conditions, during which the Fund may be most in need of liquidating its derivative positions. Derivatives may also be harder to value, less tax efficient and subject to changing government regulation that could impact the Fund's ability to use certain derivatives or their cost. Also, derivatives used for hedging or to gain or limit exposure to a particular market segment may not provide the expected benefits, particularly during adverse market conditions.
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the risk that bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise; conversely, bond prices generally rise as interest rates fall. Specific bonds differ in their sensitivity to changes in interest rates depending on their individual characteristics, including duration.
Management Risk. The investment techniques and risk analysis used by the Fund's portfolio managers may not produce the desired results.
Market Risk. The prices of and the income generated by the Fund's securities may decline in response to, among other things, investor sentiment, general economic and market conditions, regional or global instability, and currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Mortgage- and Asset-Backed Securities Risk. The Fund may invest in mortgage- and asset-backed securities that are subject to prepayment or call risk, which is the risk that the borrower's payments may be received earlier or later than expected due to changes in prepayment rates on underlying loans. Faster prepayments often happen when interest rates are falling. As a result, the Fund may reinvest these early payments at lower interest rates, thereby reducing the Fund's income. Conversely, when interest rates rise, prepayments may happen more slowly, causing the security to lengthen in duration. Longer duration securities tend to be more volatile. Securities may be prepaid at a price less than the original purchase value. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of mortgage-backed securities and could result in losses to the Fund. The risk of such defaults is generally higher in the case of mortgage pools that include subprime mortgages. Subprime mortgages refer to loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages.
Reinvestment Risk. Reinvestment risk is the risk that a bond's cash flows (coupon income and principal repayment) will be reinvested at an interest rate below that on the original bond.
TBA Transactions Risk. TBA transactions involve the risk that the securities received may be less favorable than what was anticipated by the Fund when entering into the TBA transaction. TBA transactions also involve the risk that a counterparty will fail to deliver the securities, exposing the Fund to further losses. Whether or not the Fund takes delivery of the securities at the termination date of a TBA transaction, the Fund will nonetheless be exposed to changes in the value of the underlying investments during the term of the agreement. When the Fund enters into a short sale of a TBA mortgage it does not own, the Fund may have to purchase deliverable mortgages to settle the short sale at a higher price than anticipated, thereby causing a loss. A short position in a TBA mortgage poses more risk than holding the same TBA mortgage long. As there is no limit on how much the price of mortgage securities can increase, the Fund's exposure is unlimited. The Fund may not always be able to purchase mortgage securities to close out the short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund will earmark or segregate liquid assets in an amount at least equal to its exposure for the duration of the contract. The Fund will incur increased transaction costs associated with selling TBA mortgages short. In addition, taking short positions in TBA mortgages results in a form of leverage which could increase the volatility of the Fund's share price.
U.S. Government Obligations Risk. The Fund may invest in obligations issued by U.S. Government agencies and instrumentalities that may receive varying levels of support from the government, which could affect the Fund's ability to recover should they default.
When-Issued and Delayed Delivery Risks. When-issued and delayed delivery transactions are subject to market risk as the value or yield of a security at delivery may be more or less than the purchase price or the yield generally available on securities when delivery occurs. In addition, the Fund is subject to counterparty risk because it relies on the buyer or seller, as the case may be, to consummate the transaction, and failure by the other party to complete the transaction may result in the Fund missing the opportunity of obtaining a price or yield considered to be advantageous.
Zero Coupon or Pay-In-Kind Securities Risk. The value, interest rates, and liquidity of non-cash paying instruments, such as zero coupon and pay-in-kind securities, are subject to greater fluctuation than other types of securities. The higher yields and interest rates on pay-in-kind securities reflect the payment deferral and increased credit risk associated with such instruments and that such investments may represent a higher credit risk than coupon loans. Pay-in-kind securities may have a potential variability in valuations because their continuing accruals require continuing judgments about the collectability of the deferred payments and the value of any associated collateral.

The Fund
This offering provides broad exposure to a high-quality portfolio of U.S. Government and U.S. Government Agency bonds, seeking to provide Fund shareholders with high current return. Launched in 1984, it is one of America's longest running Short-Term Gove rnment mutual funds. Managed by Andrew Szczurowski since 2014, the Fund may provide a core fixed income solution for investor portfolios.



The Approach
The Fund’s strategy draws upon Eaton Vance’s decades of experience actively managing high-quality government bond portfolios. The investment team applies a time-tested process centered upon a combination of fundamental research and relative v alue trading. The Fund principally invests in U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities as well as U.S. government-issued Treasury bills and bonds.



The Features
Designed for income investors wishing to mitigate portfolio risk through a high-quality allocation, the Fund may be complementary to many lower-quality segments of the fixed-income markets. With an attractive yield advantage over comparable maturity gove rnment bond mutual funds of similar duration and quality, the Fund may serve as a core holding for building diversified income portfolios. Managed by Eaton Vance, a government bond investing leader.

About Risk: 
An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. As interest rates rise, the value of certain inco me investments is likely to decline. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to credit, interest rate, prepayment and extension risks. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the creditworthiness of the issuer and are sub ject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. While certain U.S. government-sponsored ag encies may be chartered or sponsored by acts of Congress, their securities are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury. Derivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage ( which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying instrument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unabl e to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral or other assets held by the counterparty. The Fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the secu rity sold short increases in value between the date of the short sale and the date on which the Fund purchases the security to replace the borrowed security. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
Financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter. Key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about the Trump Administration's pro-growth agenda, stronger European economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets.
Treasury yields finished the quarter almost exactly where they began, but it was a volatile quarter with yields touching multi-year highs before retracing lower in the last two weeks. The initial move higher was aided by a newly hawkish Federal Reserve ( the Fed), emboldened by expansionary fiscal policy in the U.S. and receding risks to stability abroad. The market's rosy outlook turned negative in the last two weeks of the quarter following the Administration's failure to pass healthcare reform and ris ing uncertainty surrounding French elections and North Korea.
Entering the second quarter, the market must weigh an economy potentially running hot at 4.5% unemployment (the lowest reading since March 2007) versus the increasingly dangerous geopolitical landscape. Importantly, it seems the Fed is more concerned wit h the former as they have increased talk of winding down their $4.2trn balance sheet at the end of the year in an attempt to tighten financial conditions before inflationary pressures build too much.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Government Obligations Fund (the Fund) outperformed its benchmark, the Barclays U.S. Intermediate Government Bond Fund Index (the Index)1, at net asset value for the quarter.

The Fund benefited from a slowdown in Agency MBS prepayment speeds due to the backup in mortgage rates which occurred during the fourth quarter.

Contributors 
The Fund's investments in Seasoned Agency Fixed Rate MBS were a leading driver of performance and benefited from a slowdown in prepayment speeds stemming from the increase in mortgage rates in the fourth quarter.

The Fund's investments in fixed rate Agency CMOs also aided performance during the period as the securities outperformed Treasuries despite slight spread widening.



Detractors 
The Fund's investments in Agency Adjustable Rate Mortgages slightly underperformed Treasuries during the quarter due to their shorter durations8.


Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
Management believes that although the U.S. economy remains on a solid footing, the likelihood of tail risk events which could have a positive or negative impact on financial markets have increased due to the change in U.S. political leadership and the gr owing geopolitical uncertainties. Against this backdrop, management believes Agency MBS remain an attractive investment opportunity, as they provide investors with an attractive spread over Treasuries without taking credit risk.
In the current low yield environment, it is important not to reach for yield and be mindful of interest-rate risk. As such, management believes Agency MBS with minimal extension risk and more stable prepayment profiles remain extremely attractive in the  current rate environment.
