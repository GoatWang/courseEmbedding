Workspot, Inc. Key Developments

Workspot, Inc. Raises USD 5.03 Million Debt Offering Through Private Placement
Jun 22 17
According to SEC filing, Workspot, Inc. has raised USD 5.03 million out of planned USD 7.5 million in a debt offering, through private placement.


SCSK Corporation Completes Distributor Agreement with Workspot, Inc
Feb 23 17
SCSK Corporation announced that it has completed the distributor agreement with Workspot, Inc, the leader in next-generation Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), and will start selling Workspot's cloud-native, multi-tenant, and infinitely scalable VDI 2.0. DaaS 2.0 solution is planned to be released in 2017. Workspot VDI 2.0 is an all-in-one VDI solution, enabling IT to go from zero to client virtualization in 60 minutes. Workspot allows IT administrators to easily deploy thousands of virtual desktops in hours instead of weeks or months using Workspot's web-based management console on infrastructure that resides on premises and/or in the cloud. Workspot DaaS 2.0 reinvents traditional DaaS and delivers the benefits of running VDI workloads on any Microsoft Azure region in the world. The secret behind Workspot's speed is its cloud-native control plane architecture. By separating the control and data planes, Workspot simplifies client virtualization deployments by replacing the complex mash that is the operational front end including load balancing, brokering, databases, web portal, and provisioning services -- with a cloud service. By eliminating those components, Workspot VDI deploys in 60 minutes, requiring only IT generalists, rather than expensive client virtualization specialists, and fewer IT resources overall.


Workspot Announces Executive Appointments
Jan 9 17
Workspot announced the appointment of four new senior team members: Hamish McNee as Senior Director of Worldwide Channels, Deborah Thornton as Director of Integrated Marketing, Rommy Channe as Principal Product Manager and Henry Hernández as Senior Enterprise Solution Architect. McNee is a former Citrix executive, where he oversaw recruitment, sales execution, marketing, technical readiness, and compliance for Citrix Managed Service Provider Partners, Service Providers, and Distributors in the Americas. Prior to joining Workspot, Thornton served as Director of Worldwide Integrated Marketing at Citrix, where she developed and implemented global marketing strategies and demand generation campaigns across the product portfolio for the $3 billion technology company. At Citrix, she was an early adopter of intent-based marketing programs, with a focus on providing greater value to customers and prospects at the right time, while also delivering significantly higher return on marketing investment. Channe joins Workspot from Palerra, where he managed the addition of the company’s Shadow IT discovery solution to their SaaS product. He previously held product manager roles at Microsoft, Dell, WYSE, and Qumu, and brings extensive experience in end user computing. He will focus on Workspot’s clients, open source protocol strategy, and Microsoft relations. Hernández comes to Workspot from Citrix as a Senior System Engineer, supporting the US ARMY on the Public Sector team. He has over 15 years of experience in server, storage, and network infrastructure systems, and specializes in application and desktop virtualization technologies. He has worked with a number of IT consulting organizations, including as a Solution Architect at Dell. He has also served as a Practice Manager, including with clients like the Department of Homeland Security, Department of State, Department of Justice, Fujitsu Global, and federal independent agencies.

Maximize Your HCI Investment!

Deploying virtual desktops on your HCI has never been easier

Workspot plays well with others.

Want to keep your existing infrastructure? Go ahead. Workspot’s VDI 2.0 integrates with traditional 3-tier systems to simplify your IT operations and significantly lower your costs.
Better yet, eliminate the backend complexity by switching to our partners’ award-winning hyper-converged infrastructure. HCI is so easy to use that it can be set up in under 1 hour. After that it only takes a few clicks to seamlessly integrate it with VDI 2.0 using our easy-to-follow Reference Architecture Guides.

Maximizing your HCI with VDI 2.0 means:


Fastest Time to Deployment: Setting up HCI takes less than 1 hour. After that, it only takes a few clicks to integrate with VDI 2.0. Forget about the typical 9+ months of legacy VDI deployments.



Least Expensive Scenario: VDI 2.0 eliminates admin workflows, such as installing, patching, upgrades, and troubleshooting. Translation: OpEx is reduced by 70%.



Infinite Scalability: Want to increase your users from 100 to 500+? Simply add additional nodes to the HCI cluster and see the elastic capacity grow. You don’t need to re-architect anything.

Our HCI Partners
Visit our partner pages to download our in-depth Reference Architecture Guides. They’re proof that you don’t need a PhD in VDI to deploy enterprise grade VDI in 60 minutes or less.

Apps and desktops in a secure workspace on any device












































SHARE







  






Schedule a Demo




 
 
 


Mix-and-match
apps and desktops in a
secure workspace on any device

Access your desktops, apps, and data in a unified cloud workspace on any device
You can mix and match the delivery of different types of applications and data into a single unified workspace on any device:

Virtual Desktops
Windows client server applications
On-Premises Web Applications, like SharePoint, SAP, etc.
SaaS Web Applications like Office 365, Salesforce, etc.
Network File Shares and OneDrive

Workspot leverages the power of the end point and delivers the best and most responsive user experience for web applications and data.
The workspace is available on any device – PC, Mac, iOS, or Android. You can customize delivery so that different sets of apps and desktops show on different devices even for the same user.


Watch Video
Secured access simplified
Workspot needs just one passcode. It doesn’t get easier for end users to get to their workspace securely. And it is secured for IT too.
Once you authenticate with your passcode, you don’t need to login into all the other apps inside your workspace. Our client integrates with many different Single Sign On (SSO) solutions like Okta, NTLM/Kerberos, CA Siteminder, Oracle iDP, and others. The Workspot client seamlessly single signs on the user to enterprise applications, even those behind the VPN firewall.
So, one passcode can replace remembering different passwords for each app, launching VPN client, and putting that “\” in front of domain logins? With Workspot, that’s the new norm for the secured user experience.
Cross-Platform Rich Client Architecture
The Workspot client is a cross-platform client and provides a consistent user experience on any PCs, iPhones, Android phone, iPads, and Macs. We have created a seamless end user experience by integrating many different client technologies into Workspot: browser, RDP client, CIFS client, VPN, SSO agent, document viewers, and an RSA client. Workspot also comes with a built-in RSA token generator. All of these smarts in a single client!

Single pane of glass to control everything

Single pane of glass to deploy virtual desktops and applications
Workspot Control is a single pane of glass that enables IT to create and control a unified workspace for their end users. The unified workspace includes:

VDI using on-premises infrastructure, e.g., legacy three tier stack or hyper-converged infrastructure
VDI using the cloud, e.g., Azure
Windows client server applications running in Azure or on-premises
Web applications, both on-premises and SaaS
File shares

 


Single pane of glass to deploy anywhere
Workspot Control is a single pane of glass that enables IT to deploy applications and desktops anywhere in the world on any infrastructure. With the single instance, you can deploy desktops on legacy infrastructure in America, on hyper-converged infrastructure in EMEA, and on Azure in Japan and Australia.
As a multi-tenant cloud service, Workspot Control scales instantly, is highly available, and always up to date. Because there is nothing to install, IT can do enterprise class deployments in a day.
Single pane of glass to set policies
IT can use Workspot Control to define security policies to control the behavior of the Workspot client in real-time including the following:

Wipe out data within Workspot
Enabling/disabling offline usage of the application
Restricting access to a set of IP addresses and locations
Restricting copy and paste
Whitelist/Blacklist URLs


We have separated the control and data planes.
