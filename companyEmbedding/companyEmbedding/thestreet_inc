It Is All About Making YouA More Knowledgeable & Intelligent Investor




Investment Indices to Customize Your Portfolio Needs
Maybe you're focused on growth stocks. Or value stocks. Or income stocks. Or a blend of the 3. We have created dynamic indices to fit all 4 investment styles so you can use our
                        "indices" to match our portfolio to your stock goals.


Accountability & Transparency
We constantly seek to better serve our members through the lens of transparency, education and rigorous analysis. You'll hear a lot of financial experts claim they guarantee
                        above-average returns regardless of the market. Portfolio Managers don't tell you anything. We take a different approach: we are an open book, play with an open hand, and will always
                        tell it to you straight. You deserve that.

"...Action Alerts PLUS was the best money I ever spent.
I like that Cramer and his team are fundamentalists and only recommend financially sound stocks. I am not interested in playing the speculative game and find their strategy perfect
                    for my mid-level risk appetite...Now that I've recovered everything I lost before, I look forward to growing it in the many years to come with Action Alerts PLUS. Thank you!"

Stock Picks of the Day






                    RSS Feed for Stock Picks From TheStreet



Every day, TheStreet's stock market experts and portfolio managers provide a bevy of stock picks, starting points for stock analysis and stock ideas that merit additional research.

In the articles and videos below, you'll find actionable trading ideas and stock picks from Jim Cramer, Stephanie Link and professional traders.

Also included are links to TheStreet Ratings* top-rated stocks -- an award-winning stock-rating model that analyzes financial data on a daily basis to gauge a stock's probability of moving up or down.



















*What Our Stock Ratings Mean:
A (Excellent) - The stock has an excellent track record for maximizing performance while minimizing risk, thus delivering the best possible combination of total return on investment and reduced volatility. It has made the most of the recent economic environment to maximize risk-adjusted returns compared to other stocks. While past performance is just an indication -- not a guarantee -- we believe this fund is among the most likely to deliver superior performance relative to risk in the future as well.

B (Good) - The stock has a good track record for balancing performance with risk. Compared to other stocks, it has achieved above-average returns given the level of risk in its underlying investments. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, we believe that this fund has proven to be a good investment in the recent past.

C (Fair) - In the trade-off between performance and risk, the stock has a track record which is about average. It is neither significantly better nor significantly worse than most other stocks. With some funds in this category, the total return may be better than average, but this can be misleading since the higher return was achieved with higher than average risk. With other funds, the risk may be lower than average, but the returns are also lower. In short, based on recent history, there is no particular advantage to investing in this fund.

D (Weak) - The stock has underperformed the universe of other funds given the level of risk in its underlying investments, resulting in a weak risk-adjusted performance. Thus, its investment strategy and/or management has not been attuned to capitalize on the recent economic environment. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, we believe that this fund has proven to be a bad investment over the recent past.

E (Very Weak) - The stock has significantly underperformed most other funds given the level of risk in its underlying investments, resulting in a very weak risk-adjusted performance. Thus, its investment strategy and/or management has done just the opposite of what was needed to maximize returns in the recent economic environment. While the risk-adjusted performance of any stock is subject to change, we believe this fund has proven to be a very bad investment in the recent past.

+ (Plus Sign) - An indication that the fund is in the top third of its letter grade.

- (Minus Sign) - An indication that the fund is in the bottom third of its letter grade.

U (Unrated) - The stock is unrated because it is too new to make a reliable assessment of its risk-adjusted performance. Typically, a fund must be established for at least three years before it is eligible to receive a TheStreet Investment Rating.

A & B Ratings - Are considered to be a Buy.

C Ratings - Are considered to be a Hold.

D & E Ratings - Are considered to be a Sell.

Stock Ratings
Of what use are stock ratings if little consideration is given to investment risk? Unlike many other rating agencies, we analyze both fundamental and technical risk factors, so whether you're referring to stock market ratings for selecting your own investments or checking up on your broker's recommendation, TheStreet Ratings can help you in your evaluation.

13 Ingenious Products Made in the USA Walmart Will Soon Sell That Will Improve Your Life









Breana Noble




Jul 3, 2017 6:43 PM EDT













 

















































 Walmart  (WMT) made deals with more than 100 U.S. entrepreneurs recently to sell their products at Walmart.com as part of the retail giant's efforts to support American manufacturing. The company's fourth annual U.S. Manufacturing Open Call brought in more than 500 business owners from 47 states and Puerto Rico to tour the company's headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas, and network, according to a news release. The event, a part of Walmart Store Inc.'s 10-year plan to invest $250 billion in U.S. manufacturing, included 750 product presentations and promoted Walmart's forthcoming policy proposals that it hopes will benefit American businesses. "American entrepreneurship is on full display during Open Call," Cindi Marsiglio, Walmart vice president of U.S. Manufacturing, said in a news release. "Today has been a fantastic show of innovation, and we are proud to extend an offer and digital shelf space on Walmart.com to today's participants." The proposals under consideration would help simplify product labeling and encourage apprenticeships, according to the press release. The company is also advocating for tax and trade policies that encourage domestic manufacturing. Walmart has already committed to a 10-year plan to invest $250 billion. "We are also committed to participating as a leader in the country when it comes to policy," Walmart President and CEO Doug McMillan said in the news release. "We believe that we should be one of the voices at the table and we want to help renew U.S. manufacturing and drive the creation of manufacturing jobs across the United States." Here are 13 products consumers will soon see on Walmart's website following the event.

History[edit]
TheStreet, Inc., (formerly, TheStreet.com, Inc.) was co-founded in 1996 by Jim Cramer and Martin Peretz. The company is headquartered at 14 Wall Street in New York City. Its stock went public in May 1999 under the direction of past Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kevin English and former Chief Financial Officer Paul Kothari.[1][2]
Under the direction of Thomas J. Clarke, Jr., TheStreet's former chairman and CEO, the company reported its first annual profit in 2005. Jim Cramer became chairman in October 2008.[3] Daryl Otte, a long-time company director, became CEO in May 2009[4] after the resignation of the former CEO.[5] Otte is the founding partner of Montefiore Partners, a venture capital investment fund management firm, and a former executive at media company Ziff Davis[6] On March 7, 2012 TheStreet announced that Elisabeth DeMarse was hired as CEO and president, replacing outgoing CEO Daryl Otte.[7]
Beginning as a single web site, TheStreet, Inc. expanded and now publishes consumer Web sites MainStreet.com, Stockpickr, and Bankingmyway.com. In addition to news and financial analysis, TheStreet, Inc. also provides subscription investor services like RealMoney RealMoney Pro, Breakout Stocks, Stocks Under $10, OptionsProfits, Chat on TheStreet, The Daily Swing Trade, Top Stocks, TheStreet Ratings [8] and Action Alerts Plus,[9] run by Jack Mohr.[10]
In 2007, TheStreet, Inc. bought Stockpickr.com,[11] Rate Watch and BankingMyWay.[12] In 2008, TheStreet, Inc. purchased a 13 percent stake in Geezeo.com, the Boston-based online management tool, with an option to purchase the company.[13]
TheStreet's features include: The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week; Street Whispers, and The Digital Skeptic. Dave Kansas became editor-in-chief in April 1997. Kansas also opened a San Francisco bureau and sat on the board of TheStreet, Inc.[14] In July 2001, David J. Morrow, a former New York Times reporter, joined TheStreet, Inc. as its editor-in-chief upon Kansas's departure. Glenn Hall, a former news manager at Freedom Communications (The Orange County Register) and Bloomberg News, replaced Morrow in August 2009.[4] William Inman, former Bloomberg News Editor, replaced Glenn Hall as Editor-in-Chief in March 2012. Janet Guyon, from Fortune and The Wall Street Journal, joined in April 2014 to replace William Inman. Jim Cramer remains one of the company's commentators.
While the TheStreet's most noteworthy personality is Jim Cramer, other contributors include Adam Feuerstein, and Doug Kass. Former contributors include Aaron Task, Alix Steel, Dave Kansas, Herb Greenberg, and Brett Arends. Investors have expressed concern for the company's heavy reliance on Jim Cramer according to investing columnist Henry Blodget.[15] Blodget argued that TheStreet "has diversified in recent years, and there's plenty of talent aboard." Cramer promotes TheStreet on his TV show Mad Money and is a main contributor to TheStreet.
In 2008, the Arizona Reporter Newswire alleged that TheStreet, Inc may have conflicts of interest relating to their subsidiary Promotions.com.[16]
The company launched several mobile applications.[17] The Blackberry version was mentioned as "Official Honoree" for the Mobile Applications category of the 2009 Webby awards,[18] got an honorable mention in the 2009 "Best of the Web" awards by Min online[19] and together with the iPhone version won the 2008 "Creative Use of Online" award by the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[20]
In September 2010 TheStreet, Inc. launched a mobile website with content from their main site, thestreet.com.[21] In 1999, TheStreet's market value was $1.7bn. In 2014, the NASDAQ-listed company is worth less than $80m.[22]
Subsidiaries[edit]
MainStreet.com[edit]
MainStreet.com is an online financial magazine & news site by TheStreet.com, directed toward mainstream America and presupposing a very limited financial knowledge (unlike TheStreet.com). In addition to news, features and articles, Mainstreet.com features consumer reports and investing advice. Users who have trouble engaging with TheStreet.com, because of the terminology and assumed knowledge, tend to find MainStreet.com much more accessible, since it is written for the average layperson who does not have an in-depth understanding of Wall Street. Unlike its parent company TheStreet.com, MainStreet covers all sectors of business and daily life from business to fashion. Mainstreet headquarters in located on Wall Street. [clarification needed][citation needed].[23]
StockPickr[edit]
StockPickr is a financial services site. It is one of the first sites to incorporate both investment ideas as well as social networking. This community, known as the Stock Idea Network, combines insight from professional investors as well as community members. Users are able to share, debate, and otherwise discuss information and ideas related to finance on the site's message boards, which are frequented by financial professionals.[24]
StockPickr was named one of Time.com's 50 best web sites in 2007. There are an estimated 150,000-plus user-generated portfolios, as well as portfolios of professional finance professionals on the site.[24]
BankingMyWay.com[edit]
BankingMyWay.com is a personal banking and investment site, focused on the individual's finances rather than investments.
The Deal[edit]
September 12, 2012 [25] TheStreet.com acquired The Deal LLC, a media company that covers mergers and acquisitions.[26]
DealFlow Media[edit]
On April 22, 2013, TheStreet Inc. acquired The DealFlow Report and The Life Settlements Report financial newsletters and the PrivateRaise database from DealFlow Media Inc. Financial terms were not disclosed. The DealFlow Report covers the microcap equity markets, including initial public offerings and private placements, while The Life Settlements Report focuses on life insurance settlements. The content of both newsletters will be made available to The Deal Pipeline subscribers. The target has 10 employees, half based in Petaluma, California, and the others in Woodbury, New York.

Jim Cramer became chairman in October 2008.[3] Daryl Otte, a long-time company director, became CEO in May 2009[4] after the resignation of the former CEO.[5] Otte is the founding partner of Montefiore Partners, a venture capital investment fund management firm, and a former executive at media company Ziff Davis[6] On March 7, 2012 TheStreet announced that Elisabeth DeMarse was hired as CEO and president, replacing outgoing CEO Daryl Otte.[7]
Beginning as a single web site, TheStreet, Inc. expanded and now publishes consumer Web sites MainStreet.com, Stockpickr, and Bankingmyway.com. In addition to news and financial analysis, TheStreet, Inc. also provides subscription investor services like RealMoney RealMoney Pro, Breakout Stocks, Stocks Under $10, OptionsProfits, Chat on TheStreet, The Daily Swing Trade, Top Stocks, TheStreet Ratings [8] and Action Alerts Plus,[9] run by Jack Mohr.[10]
In 2007, TheStreet, Inc. bought Stockpickr.com,[11] Rate Watch and BankingMyWay.[12] In 2008, TheStreet, Inc. purchased a 13 percent stake in Geezeo.com, the Boston-based online management tool, with an option to purchase the company.[13]
TheStreet's features include: The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week; Street Whispers, and The Digital Skeptic. Dave Kansas became editor-in-chief in April 1997. Kansas also opened a San Francisco bureau and sat on the board of TheStreet, Inc.[14] In July 2001, David J. Morrow, a former New York Times reporter, joined TheStreet, Inc. as its editor-in-chief upon Kansas's departure. Glenn Hall, a former news manager at Freedom Communications (The Orange County Register) and Bloomberg News, replaced Morrow in August 2009.[4] William Inman, former Bloomberg News Editor, replaced Glenn Hall as Editor-in-Chief in March 2012. Janet Guyon, from Fortune and The Wall Street Journal, joined in April 2014 to replace William Inman. Jim Cramer remains one of the company's commentators.
While the TheStreet's most noteworthy personality is Jim Cramer, other contributors include Adam Feuerstein, and Doug Kass. Former contributors include Aaron Task, Alix Steel, Dave Kansas, Herb Greenberg, and Brett Arends. Investors have expressed concern for the company's heavy reliance on Jim Cramer according to investing columnist Henry Blodget.[15] Blodget argued that TheStreet "has diversified in recent years, and there's plenty of talent aboard." Cramer promotes TheStreet on his TV show Mad Money and is a main contributor to TheStreet.
In 2008, the Arizona Reporter Newswire alleged that TheStreet, Inc may have conflicts of interest relating to their subsidiary Promotions.com.[16]
The company launched several mobile applications.[17] The Blackberry version was mentioned as "Official Honoree" for the Mobile Applications category of the 2009 Webby awards,[18] got an honorable mention in the 2009 "Best of the Web" awards by Min online[19] and together with the iPhone version won the 2008 "Creative Use of Online" award by the Society of American Business Editors and Writers (SABEW).[20]
In September 2010 TheStreet, Inc. launched a mobile website with content from their main site, thestreet.com.[21] In 1999, TheStreet's market value was $1.7bn. In 2014, the NASDAQ-listed company is worth less than $80m.[22]
Subsidiaries[edit]
MainStreet.com[edit]
MainStreet.com is an online financial magazine & news site by TheStreet.com, directed toward mainstream America and presupposing a very limited financial knowledge (unlike TheStreet.com). In addition to news, features and articles, Mainstreet.com features consumer reports and investing advice. Users who have trouble engaging with TheStreet.com, because of the terminology and assumed knowledge, tend to find MainStreet.com much more accessible, since it is written for the average layperson who does not have an in-depth understanding of Wall Street. Unlike its parent company TheStreet.com, MainStreet covers all sectors of business and daily life from business to fashion. Mainstreet headquarters in located on Wall Street. [clarification needed][citation needed].[23]
StockPickr[edit]
StockPickr is a financial services site. It is one of the first sites to incorporate both investment ideas as well as social networking. This community, known as the Stock Idea Network, combines insight from professional investors as well as community members. Users are able to share, debate, and otherwise discuss information and ideas related to finance on the site's message boards, which are frequented by financial professionals.[24]
StockPickr was named one of Time.com's 50 best web sites in 2007. There are an estimated 150,000-plus user-generated portfolios, as well as portfolios of professional finance professionals on the site.[24]
BankingMyWay.com[edit]
BankingMyWay.com is a personal banking and investment site, focused on the individual's finances rather than investments.
The Deal[edit]
September 12, 2012 [25] TheStreet.com acquired The Deal LLC, a media company that covers mergers and acquisitions.[26]
DealFlow Media[edit]
On April 22, 2013, TheStreet Inc. acquired The DealFlow Report and The Life Settlements Report financial newsletters and the PrivateRaise database from DealFlow Media Inc. Financial terms were not disclosed. The DealFlow Report covers the microcap equity markets, including initial public offerings and private placements, while The Life Settlements Report focuses on life insurance settlements. The content of both newsletters will be made available to The Deal Pipeline subscribers. The target has 10 employees, half based in Petaluma, California, and the others in Woodbury, New York.

TheStreet, Inc. Key Developments

TheStreet, Inc. Partners with Wibbitz to Accelerate Digital Video Production
Jun 15 17
Wibbitz announced that it has partnered with TheStreet.com, a business unit of TheStreet, Inc. A team of editors at TheStreet will manage Wibbitz's creation platform to produce videos for its website, social platforms, and mobile app. The partnership will introduce automation technology into the newsroom in order to grow in scale and improve efficiency of video workflow. In addition to financial news and information, TheStreet produces broadcast-style video featuring well-known analysts and journalists. Wibbitz's patented text-to-video technology will multiply video production and keep pace with the 24/7 breaking news cycle by automatically generating rough-cut videos from article RSS feeds within seconds, which can then be quickly reviewed, edited and published by TheStreet's editorial team in near real-time.


TheStreet, Inc. Announces Listing Transfer From Nasdaq Global Market To Nasdaq Capital Market
Jun 13 17
TheStreet, Inc. announced that the Nasdaq Stock Market has approved the Company's application to list its common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company's securities will be transferred from the Nasdaq Global Market to the Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of business on June 14, 2017. The Nasdaq Capital Market is a continuous trading market that operates in substantially the same manner as the Nasdaq Global Market and listed companies must meet certain financial requirements and comply with Nasdaq's corporate governance requirements. As previously reported, the Company was notified by Nasdaq on December 14, 2016, that it no longer satisfied the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing of $1.00 per share. In anticipation of not meeting the minimum bid price requirement by June 12, 2017, the end of its initial 180-day grace period, the Company applied to transfer the listing of its common stock to the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company is now being afforded an additional 180-day grace period, or until December 11, 2017, to regain compliance with the Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, the minimum bid price per share of the Company's common stock must be at least $1.00 for at least ten consecutive business days during the additional 180-day grace period. If the Company fails to regain compliance during this grace period, the Company's common stock will be subject to delisting by Nasdaq. The Company has provided written notice of its intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second grace period by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary.
