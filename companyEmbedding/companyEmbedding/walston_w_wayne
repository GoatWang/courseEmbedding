Our practice in this area is quite diverse and includes labor relations employment law, discrimination and 42 U.S.C. 1983 matters, litigation, public records and open door issues, governmental relations, public finance, real estate and tax law. We have represented numerous municipal entities in labor negotiations; arbitration proceedings; federal court employment discrimination and civil rights litigation; state and federal regulatory audit matters; general litigation; tax incremental financing and other bonding procedures; and assessments and condemnation proceedings. In addition, several members of the Municipal Law Section are also county attorneys.Property LawConstruction LitigationBeers Mallers Backs & Salin, LLP provides a number of services in the area of construction law. The Firm’s primary clients are owners, public entities, general contractors and subcontractors. Our clients range from contractors doing business in the Midwest to local and regional companies involved in projects in both the private and public sectors.Land Use and ZoningOur clients range from individuals and families to Fortune 500 companies. We handle all legal matters that impact our clients’ business, personal and professional lives. This includes business and corporate law, real estate and land use, employment law, creditors’ rights and bankruptcy, elder law and Medicaid planning, estate planning and administration, litigation, and municipal law. The majority of our clients are located in Northeast Indiana; however, we are licensed to practice in Michigan and have numerous clients in the tri-state area (Indiana, Michigan and Ohio) and from throughout the United States.Finance LawBankruptcyTax LawOur attorneys have more than 100 years of collective experience in the areas of sophisticated family and individual estate planning, business succession planning, tax planning, and trust and estate administration services. We have drafted and administered numerous living and testamentary trusts, family limited partnerships, qualified personal residence trusts, grantor retained annuity trusts, life insurance trusts, charitable lead and remainder trusts, and other sophisticated estate planning documents. In addition, we focus on the planning needs and objectives of younger professionals and businessmen and women as their businesses and organizations grow.Family LawDivorceBeers Mallers Backs & Salin, LLP family law attorneys understand the concern and complexity involved in making the difficult decision to divorce a spouse. We are committed to providing comprehensive family law services from providing consultation prior to filing for divorce, through preparing for the financial realities and the psychological impact of divorce, to any post-divorce modifications, our lawyers are dedicated to be there for our clients whenever they need us.Child Custody and VisitationAdoptionPremarital AgreementGuardianshipElder law involves a wide range of issues, everything from estate planning, asset preservation and guardianship to the procurement of government benefits, housing and care-giving options. Our goal in this area of the law is to guide elderly clients and their loved ones through the legal issues and possible financial problems that come with growing older, and preserve our clients’ personal and financial independence for as long as possible. We can show you a variety of ways to qualify for long-term care assistance from Medicaid —without spending down all of your assets. Procuring this assistance is particularly important today, with the cost of nursing home care averaging more than $6,000 a month and climbing ever higher. Also, people are living longer than ever before. In fact, more than 50 percent of people aged 65 will need help because of incapacity at some point in their lives.Spousal SupportLegal SeparationTrusts and EstatesEstate PlanningWe understand that today’s farmers are faced with more issues than just the management of their farm operation. We understand that many skill sets are required to meet all of your needs. It may be Business Lawyers who can assist with choosing what corporate structure will best suit your business operations and future goals and other business concerns. It may be Estate Planning and Business Succession attorneys to help you pass your farming operation to the next generation while considering the needs, interests, and tax liability issues of various members of your family. It may be Real Estate attorneys who can assist with the purchase of additional property. You can be assured that we will take a holistic approach to your planning and that we have the areas of practice required to meet all of the unique and diverse needs of a farmer.WillsTrustsAt Beers Mallers Backs & Salin, LLP, many of our trust administration clients are also our estate planning clients. There are times, however, when an individual or family has a trust drafted by another attorney and asks us to manage its administration. In either case, we make this complex process as simple, efficient and stress-free as possible by handling every step of the administration process.Power of AttorneyOur approach to estate planning is highly personalized. We believe that proper estate planning is about much more than just preparing Wills, Trusts, Powers of Attorney and other documents. It is about taking the time to listen carefully, ask the right questions, and get to know your family’s values, concerns, and hopes for the future. Only when we have a thorough understanding of your unique situation do we design a customized plan tailored to meet all of your needs.Health LawSocial Security DisabilitySocial Security Disability and Supplemental Security Income applications and the review process are time consuming and detail driven. The Social Security Administration reviews thousands of applications, most of which are composed of medical, work and education records. If there is missing information, only a portion of the applicant’s history can be reviewed. If a deadline is missed, the applicant may be denied and have to start the long process all over. Filing an appeal usually means more paper work, additional deadlines and possibly an administrative hearing. The value of an attorney can make a difference in the outcome of your case.Medicaid PlanningAt Beers Mallers, our attorneys and staff have attended untold hours of continuing legal education training on advanced elder law, estate planning and Medicaid planning issues. We have lectured at dozens of public and private seminars, church events, and educational institutions, and written and delivered scholarly research papers to Elder Law attorneys and the legal bar. In sum, we have counseled hundreds of elderly clients and their families, and we can find a solution to the costs and stresses of nursing home care for you or a loved one. It will be our privilege and delight to put our experience to work in the service of your needs.Business and Corporate LawCorporate LawMergers and AcquisitionsAs business owners ourselves, we understand that effective legal counsel is sometimes more than simply identifying a legal issue. Our Business and Corporate Section strives not only to resolve complex business matters but also to afford our clients the benefit of our experience as creative counselors and entrepreneurs. As general, regional or local counsel, we represent publicly-held and closely-held businesses operating in virtually every sector of the economy. We have extensive experience representing corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and individuals in a wide variety of commercial transactions. Such transactions include the purchase and sale of real estate and businesses, mergers and acquisitions, the purchase and sale of equipment and other personal property assets, stock transfers, private placement offerings, asset-based financing, and negotiating franchise and distributorship agreements..Business DisputesBusiness TransactionsLimited Liability CompaniesSend to PhoneWalston, W Wayne2174 N Pointe Dr, Warsaw, IN 46582(574) 267-4300Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailWalston, W Wayne2174 N Pointe Dr, Warsaw, IN 46582(574) 267-4300Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
