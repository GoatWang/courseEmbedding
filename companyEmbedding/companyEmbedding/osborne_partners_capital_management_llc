The Endowment Model



In the Endowment Model discipline, portfolios are actively managed over multiple asset classes. These asset classes include global equities, foreign equities, fixed income, natural resources, real estate, and alternative assets.
While each individual asset class has its own characteristics, return profile, and risk in different economic environments, managing portfolios with allocations to multiple asset classes allows investors to experience excellent long-term returns, with far less risk than a portfolio comprised mostly of equities.

Zacks Investment Research lowered shares of CA Inc. (NASDAQ:CA) from a buy rating to a hold rating in a research report released on Monday morning. 
According to Zacks, “CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period.”

Jefferies Group LLC  restated a buy rating and issued a $38.00 price target on shares of CA in a research report on Friday, April 28th.
