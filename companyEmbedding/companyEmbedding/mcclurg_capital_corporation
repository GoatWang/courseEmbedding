McClurg  Capital affords investors the choice of how they pay for investment guidance  and implementation.  Clients may chose to utilize our Full-Service Brokerage on a traditional pay as  you go commission basis; or elect a fee-based solution through our Registered Investment Advisory where we are  compensated based on a modest percentage of the assets in your account.  We think of our  client relationship as a “partnership in  performance”. Regardless of your preference, we assume a higher  level of accountability than that which is  otherwise found in a typical brokerage, bank, or mutual fund relationship. We  want to be your single source financial partner.

McCLURG CAPITAL CORPORATION'S 
		    BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN DISCLOSURE
McClurg Capital has  developed a Business Continuity Plan explaining how we will respond to events  that significantly disrupt our business.   Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is  unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as  they occur.  With that in mind, we are  providing you with this information on our business continuity plan. 
CONTACTING US
	        If after a significant business disruption you cannot  contact your McClurg Capital Representative  as you usually do, you should call our alternative numbers 415-472-1445 or  888-472-1430.  If you cannot access us  through either of those means, and you have a brokerage account carried by our  clearing firm, Pershing, LLC, you  should contact Pershing via its website http://www.pershing.com/customer_support.htm or via telephone at 201-413-3635 for instructions on how it may provide prompt  access to your funds and securities including accepting buy and sell orders and  issuing checks and wires from your account.   If you cannot access the instructions from the website or previously  noted telephone numbers, Pershing may be contacted via facsimile transmittal at (201) 413-5368 or at  (213) 624-6100 extension  500 as an alternate telephone number for recorded instructions.
If your account is held at a mutual fund or insurance  company, you should contact the company directly for access to your securities.
If you are unsure whether your account is carried by  Pershing or by a mutual fund or insurance company, check your account  statement.  Brokerage accounts held with  Pershing will have the McClurg Capital logo  in the upper left corner; accounts held with a mutual fund or insurance company  will have that company’s name and logo at the top of the statement.
OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLAN (“BCP”)
 We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations  after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our  employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment,  protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact  business.  In short, our business  continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as soon as  possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.
Our business continuity plan addresses the following: data  back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational  assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and  regulators; alternative physical location of employees; critical supplier,  contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our  customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to  continue our business.
   
		      Our clearing firm, Pershing, LLC, backs up our important  brokerage records in a geographically separate area.  While every emergency situation poses unique problems  based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the  disruption, we have been advised by our clearing firm that its objective is to  restore its own operations and be able to complete existing brokerage  transactions and accept new transactions and payments within four hours.  Your orders and requests for funds and  securities could be delayed during this period. 
If your account is held at a mutual fund or insurance  company, the company will have back up records of your account  information.  Each company’s estimate of  its recovery time is different; you should contact the company directly if you  require further information. 
VARYING DISRUPTIONS
 Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope,  such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business  district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole  region.  Within each of these areas, the  severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe.  In a disruption to only our firm or a  building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to a local site when  needed and expect to recover and resume business within 24 hours.  In a disruption affecting our business  district, city, or region, we will transfer our operations to a site outside of  the affected area, and recover and resume business within 48 hours. If the  business disruption is so severe that it prevents us from remaining in  business, we will assure our customer’s prompt access to their funds and  securities.
FOR MORE INFORMATION
If  you have questions about our business continuity planning, please contact your McClurg Capital Representative.
 
ORDER ROUTING & BEST EXECUTION
McClurg  Capital does not receive compensation for directing order flow.  Our clearing firm, Pershing, selects certain  market centers to provide execution of over-the-counter and exchange-listed  securities transactions which agree to accept orders, transmitted  electronically up to a specified size, and to execute them at or better than  the national best bid or offer (NBBO).   On certain larger orders, or if the designated market centers do not  make a market in the subject security, Pershing directly contacts market  centers to obtain an execution.  The  designated market centers to which orders are automatically routed are selected  based on the consistent high quality of their executions in one or more market  segments and their ability to provide opportunities for executions at prices  superior to the NBBO.
Pershing  regularly reviews reports for quality of execution purposes.
Pershing  has provided the data concerning the routing of order flow (the ”Data”) on the  order routing disclosure web site.   Although Pershing has used commercially reasonable efforts to provide  accurate data, the data is provided to you on an “as is” basis.
If you  would like to read this information, visit the order routing disclosure site, www.orderroutingdisclosure.com. 
EXTENDED HOURS  TRADING RISK
You  should consider the following points before engaging in extended hours  trading.  “Extended hours trading” means  trading outside of “regular trading hours.”   Regular trading hours” generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and  4:00 p.m. (ET).  McClurg Capital does not  recommend participation in extended hours trading, except for unusual  circumstances.

Risk of Lower  Liquidity.  Liquidity refers  to the ability of market participants to buy and sell securities.  Liquidity is important because with greater  liquidity investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for  securities purchased or sold.  There may  be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular trading  hours.  As a result, your order may only  be partially executed, or not at all.
Risk of Higher  Volatility.  Volatility  refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when trading.  There may be greater volatility in extended  hours trading than in regular trading hours.
Risk of Changing  Prices.  The prices of  securities traded in extended hours trading may not reflect the prices either  at the end of regular trading hours, or upon the opening the next morning.
Risk of Unlinked  Markets.  Depending on the  extended hours trading system or the time of day, the prices displayed on a  particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the prices in other  concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same  securities.
Risk of News  Announcements.  Important financial information is frequently  announced outside of regular trading hours.   In extended hours trading, these announcements may cause an exaggerated  and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.
Risk of Wider  Spreads.  The spread refers to the difference in price  between what you can buy a security for and what you can sell it for.  Lower liquidity in extended hours trading may  result in wider than normal spreads.

ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE PATRIOT ACT
 To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and  money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial institutions to  obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an  account.  When you open an account, we will  ask for your name, address, date of birth and other information that will allow  us to identify you.  We may also ask to  see your driver’s license or other identifying documents.  Failure to disclose all information requested  may result in a delay or denial in opening your new account.  Please be advised that our request for  information is required under federal law.
SIPC
          Information regarding the Securities Investor  Protection Corporation (SIPC) including a SIPC brochure, may be obtained by  contacting SIPC via its website at www.sipc.org or by calling 202-371-8300.           


PRIVACY POLICY
This Privacy Statement  answers some questions about what nonpublic personal information we collect,  what we do with it, and how we protect it.
At the time of opening an  account with McClurg Capital, we gather from you certain personal and financial  information on your new account application.   This information may be used to determine the suitability of certain  investment securities and to verify identity as required by federal law under  the U.S. Patriots Act of 2001.  You may  be assured, however, that no information will be released to any third party  except as required by law.
When you apply for or  maintain an account with us, we collect the following types of information:
            ~  Information  provided by you, such as your name, address, social security      number, date of  birth,   employment information and financial information.
            ~  Information  about your transactions with us.
McClurg Capital discloses the  nonpublic personal information about you described above, primarily to provide  you with the financial services you seek from us.  Our privacy policy continues to apply to you  even if you are no longer a customer.
McClurg Capital does not  disclose nonpublic personal information about you to any non-financial services  company.  McClurg Capital does not sell  your personal information to any nonaffiliated companies for marketing  purposes.
McClurg Capital discloses  information to nonaffiliated companies that work for us in providing financial  services to you.  For example, we provide  information to nonaffiliated companies that perform data processing services  for us and companies that prepare and mail statements and proxy materials.  These companies, acting on our behalf are  required to keep your personal information confidential.
Additionally, McClurg Capital  discloses nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third parties as  required by law.  These parties include  government/regulatory organizations such as the Internal Revenue Service and  the Securities and Exchange Commission.   Disclosures for which you have provided your consent are also permitted.
						We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural  safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal  information.  Access to your nonpublic  personal information is limited to those employees who need to know that  information to provide products or services to you, such as customer services  personnel.

Full Service Brokerage 



McClurg Capital's full service brokerage fills an important gap for both the large and small individual investor. Many of today's investors are using the services of the discount brokerage or on-line brokerage firms. The investor can save on commissions, do his own research, and try to build his portfolio with self-selected stocks, bonds, mutual funds and annuities. Most investors, however, are reluctant to invest a serious portion of their assets without professional guidance. 

          Those investors that are still using the traditional "mega" brokerage firms are increasingly finding themselves abandoned to call centers if their accounts are less than six digits in size. These call centers are staffed with inexperienced brokers that are ill equipped to deal directly in complex financial markets or to formulate wealth management solutions for serious investors. 

          McClurg Capital is staffed with tenured professionals with specialties in growth and income securities, tax-exempt municipal bonds*, corporate and treasury bonds, mutual funds, annuities, and options. We provide individuals, the self-employed and small businesses with retirement plan consultation, ideas for growth and income, and implement solutions. 

          Our full service brokers are compensated by commissions only when our client is satisfied with the appropriateness of a recommendation and initiate a transaction. Your savings have been hard earned, and whether you are a large client or small, you will receive professional service and advice. As a small, independent firm, our success depends on repeat business with satisfied clients. You may be assured that all of our efforts are dedicated to the success of 
          your investments. 

* Municipal bonds maybe subject to Alternative Minimum Tax

Our Philosophy





Home

 
McClurg Capital is confident that the demographics of the next ten years will yield to U.S. capital markets unprecedented accumulation of investment assets. This accumulation should occur from the following 
        major sources:

        • Continued appreciation of U.S. financial assets through healthy economic growth 

        • Increased savings and investment rates from the increasing numbers of older Americans

        • Legislative liberalization of IRA, Roth, 401k, and other innovative savings accounts to relieve pressure from the Social Security system

        • Continuing growth in individual contributions to company sponsored 401k or 403b retirement plans

        • Inheritance by the "baby boomers” of their parents' accumulated life-long savings, investments, and real 
        estate assets

        McClurg Capital serves investors who wish to use a full service brokerage and investment advisory firm. We build long term relationships with serious investors who expect to work with a highly trained securities professional versed in all aspects of wealth management and financial instruments.
      		Clients of McClurg Capital benefit from expert guidance and strategic advice for growth.

Dear Prospective Client:

          I am pleased to introduce you to McClurg Capital's private portfolio management services.

          You may be assured that all of the efforts of our professional staff are singularly dedicated to enhancing the value of your investments. Our organization's growth depends on the growth of your assets. I like to think of our relationship as a "partnership in performance". 

          We also promise to utilize high-quality, seasoned investment securities that are suitable to your investment goals and risk tolerance. We pledge that quality and diversification will never be compromised. 

          When compared to mutual funds, wrap accounts, and other management companies, we have designed one of the most cost effective methods for the small to medium sized investor to participate in equity and debt markets. As we grow, we promise to continuously strive to reduce those costs still further. Our essential business strategy is to deliver premium investment performance at the lowest possible cost to 
        our clients. 
 
Worry less, enjoy life more.


 


      I personally promise to be available to our clients for personal meetings or phone calls. I promise to always put your interests before our own. The individual investments in your account will be well thought out and risk will be prudently assessed. I will work hard to make your investment experience rewarding rather than agonizing. I encourage you to contact me if you have any concerns, whatsoever, regarding our level of service, portfolio management, trade execution, or performance reports. I can be reached at (415) 472-1445 or toll free at (888) 472-1430. My e-mail is invest@mcclurgcapital.com. 

      The staff of McClurg Capital and I look forward to earning your confidence and establishing a lasting relationship.

      Sincerely,

David G. McClurg,
    President

McClurg  Capital affords investors the choice of how they pay for investment guidance  and implementation.  Clients may chose to utilize our Full-Service Brokerage on a traditional pay as  you go commission basis; or elect a fee-based solution through our Registered Investment Advisory where we are  compensated based on a modest percentage of the assets in your account.  We think of our  client relationship as a “partnership in  performance”. Regardless of your preference, we assume a higher  level of accountability than that which is  otherwise found in a typical brokerage, bank, or mutual fund relationship. We  want to be your single source financial partner.
McClurg  Capital Corporation is a financial services company owned by dedicated,  experienced investment professionals of highest ethical standards.  Established in 1985 and headquartered in San  Rafael, California, McClurg Capital provides investment services and support to  help our clients achieve their financial goals   The firm offers its expertise to an elite corps of investors seeking  participation in unusual opportunities in undervalued assets, special growth  situations, and high quality fixed-income securities.  This brochure offers a profile of McClurg  Capital, its philosophy, capabilities, and innovative approach to the industry.
