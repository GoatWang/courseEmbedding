About AMG 


AMG OverviewPhilosophyHistoryClientsProductsAMG FundsAMG Wealth PartnersAffiliatesManagement Team





Back to AMG AffiliatesTrilogy Global AdvisorsInvestment DisciplineTrilogy Global Advisors follows a consistent bottom-up, growth-oriented investment process based on the belief that future earnings growth is a key determinant of long-term equity returns. The research discipline focuses on identifying companies with a high level of sustainable earnings power   or companies poised to achieve improved earnings growth in the near-term. Accordingly, Trilogy's portfolios contain a mix of both traditional growth companies and early stage growth companies. Trilogy's overall goal is to provide above benchmark returns at a moderate level of risk.Trilogy's process uses a unique combination of quantitative and qualitative screens to focus research on companies that meet strict investment criteria. The process focuses on identifying growth companies that are likely to deliver superior earnings growth relative to their global industry peers. Investment ideas are subjected to rigorous due diligence, which may include meetings with company management and extensive financial statement analysis and modeling. A unique aspect of the process is that each analyst evaluates the upside potential versus the downside risk of every security Trilogy considers for investment. Risk management focuses on avoiding losses, rather than minimizing tracking error relative to the benchmark.The FirmTrilogy Global Advisors was founded in 1999 and is an extremely well resourced investment boutique. The investment team consists of over 25 investment and trading professionals with an average of 20 years investment experience. Trilogy provides long only investment management services primarily for institutional clients. The firm’s core products are Global Equities, International Equities, Emerging Market Equities and Emerging Wealth  Equities.Trilogy strives to exceed client’s expectations and maintaining a reputation for excellence. The firm manages all aspects of the business based on the core values: Client Focus, Integrity, Process Orientation, Teamwork, and Continual Improvement.Contact Information1140 Avenue of the  Americas  18th Floor New
