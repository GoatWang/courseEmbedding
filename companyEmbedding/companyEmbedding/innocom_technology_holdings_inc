	 included herein.








	PART I.












	Item 1. Business







	History






	Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc., (the Company) was organized under the laws of the state of Nevada on June 26, 1998 under the name Dolphin Productions, Inc. The Company had provided musical and other performance services for concerts and public events. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003, the Company determined to shift its emphasis away from the presentation of concerts and toward the Internet marketing of recorded music. The Company encountered substantial competitive, legal, technological and financial obstacles to its entry into the business of marketing recorded music through the Internet. The Company had not generated substantial revenues from Internet marketing of musical properties.





	On March 30, 2006, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated March 15, 2006 among the Company, Innocom Technology Holdings Limited, a British Virgin Islands corporation, (Innocom) and certain shareholders of Innocom, the Company acquired 100% of Innocoms issued and outstanding common stock making Innocom a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result, the Company, which previously had no material operations, acquired the business of Innocom which had two principal business lines: design and solution provision for mobile phones, and trading of mobile phone handsets and related components.





	In 2006, we changed the name of the Company from Dolphin Production, Inc. to Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.





	Due to keen competition, the Company ceased the business of design and solution provision for mobile phone segment in the last quarter of 2006 and disposed of entire segment in May 2007 with a profit of US$599,544.





	In February 2007, we established a wholly-foreign owned subsidiary company to acquire distressed land, factory building and equipment under receivership from municipal government. The factory would be used for assembling mobile phones under the trademark we purchased in May 2007 and components parts on OEM basis.





	In May 2007, we acquired a trade mark, namely Tsinghua Unisplendour for a period of 10 years.





	In February 2009, the Company ceased its principal operation in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. We have written down the value of the manufacturing facility to nil value but we have no intention to dispose of it. We continue to seek out production contracts for the facility and the Company intends to continue to operate the manufacturing facility depending upon the market recovery condition and demands from the customers.





	In February 2012, we established a new Hong Kong subsidiary company, named Lead Faith International Trading Limited, to explore possible trading business. We disposed of this subsidiary at cost in April 2012.






	4










	On September 17, 2013, the Company filed an amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to our Articles of Incorporation authorizing an increase of our authorized common stock from 50,000,000 common shares to 490,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 and authorizing 10,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share.







	Our Business







	We provided sourcing of mobile phone handsets and components for customers on a wholesale basis.







	Customers







	Before suspension of manufacturing operation, our customers of mobile phone handsets included major mobile handset brand owners in China, such as TCL, CECT, Cosun Communications, Panda Communications and Zhejiang Holley Communication Group Co., Ltd.







	Facilities







	Through Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology, we hold a piece of land of 64,000 square meters and a factory building of 25,000 square meters under lease term expiring in 2054 in at No.55 Zhonglou Development Zone, Changzhou, Zhejiang Province, the PRC.





	Other than abovementioned properties held by Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology, we do not own any land and building. Current 248 square meters office is rented by Chinarise Capital (Hong Kong) Limited, a company owned and controlled by William Hui, our Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder. We utilize these office facilities at no charge.







	Employees







	As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 2 full-time employees. The Company does not have any collective bargaining agreements with its employees and we consider our employee relations to be good.

	In February 2009, the Company determined to have a closure in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions have deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company has discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. However, the Company has no intention to dispose of the production facilities. We are seeking production contracts, both volume and operating contribution of which warrant us to start the production facilities again. We have expended several million establishing our manufacturing facilities. Despite the fact that we have written down the value of the manufacturing facility to nil value we have no intention to dispose of it. We continue to seek out production contracts for the facility. We will need to privately offer and sell shares in order to finance initial working capital should we resume production.






	Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015






	During the year ended December 31, 2016, we experienced a net loss of $122,848 representing aggregated amount of general and administrative expenses for the year. The slightly drop of loss as compared with 2015 is due to decrease of utilities expenses during the year.





	During the year ended December 31, 2015, we experienced a net loss of $141,938 representing aggregated amount of general and administrative expenses for the year. The slightly rise of loss as compared with 2014 is due to increase of utilities expenses during the year.






	Revenue






	We did not have active business operations during 2016 and 2015. As a result of the discontinuance of business and operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC, no revenue was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.






	Administrative Expenses






	Administrative expenses for 2016 and 2015 mainly include office utilities charges, salaries and professional fee.






	7










	The slightly decrease of administrative expenses for 2016 as compared with 2015 was primarily attributable to decrease of accounting and utilities expenses.






	Net Loss






	Net loss for 2016 of $122,848 represents aggregated amount of general and administrative expenses for the year. The slightly decrease of loss as compared with 2015 is due to decrease of accounting fee and utilities expenses during the year.





	Net loss for 2015 of $141,938 represents aggregated amount of general and administrative expenses for the year. The slightly rise of loss as compared with 2014 is due to increase of accounting fee and utilities expenses during the year.






	Trends, Events, and Uncertainties






	N/A






	Liquidity and Capital Resources for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015







	Cash flows used in operating activities






	We experienced negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of $44,284 for the year ended December 31, 2016.





	We experienced negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of $82,886 for the year ended December 31, 2015.





	As the Company did not have any income during 2016 and 2015, the cash flows used in operations representing general and administrative expenses paid. The decrease of negative cash flows is due to the decrease of general and administrative experienced in 2016.


	 



	Cash flows from investing activities






	During 2016, there were no investing activities.





	During 2015, there were no investing activities.






	Cash flows from financing activities






	During 2016, we obtained a $43,721 interest free advance from a related party.





	During 2015, we obtained a $82,600 interest free advance from a related party.





	The said interest free advance is in nature of current account under oral agreement without repayment period, repayment of which depends upon future profitable operations or may be made by capitalization issue of new shares.






	Liquidity






	On a long-term basis, our liquidity will be dependent on establishing profitable operations, receipt of revenues, additional infusions of capital and additional financing. If necessary, we may raise capital through an equity or debt offering. The funds raised from this offering will be used to develop and execute our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth potential will be adversely affected. Additionally, we will have to significantly modify our plans.






	Critical Accounting Policies






	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	The Board of Directors and Stockholders of



	Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.






	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, cash flows and stockholders deficit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits include consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.





	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred continuous losses and capital deficits, all of which raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	1.




	ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND






	Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. (the Company or INCM) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 1998. On June 20, 2006, the Company changed its name from Dolphin Productions, Inc. to Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.





	The Company, through its subsidiaries, is principally engaged in trading and manufacture of mobile phone handsets and components in Hong Kong and the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC).





	In February 2009, the Company has temporarily ceased its planned principal operation in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions have deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company temporarily discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. The Company intends to continue to operate the manufacturing facility depending upon the market recovery condition and demands from the customers.





	INCM and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as (the Company).






	2.




	GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES






	The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.





	From its inception, the Company has suffered from continuous losses with an accumulated deficit of $13,409,329 as of December 31, 2016 and experienced negative cash flows from operations. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through December 31, 2016 is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management believes the Company is currently pursuing additional financing for its operations. However, there is no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing sufficient funds to sustain the operations.





	These and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	·


	Basis of presentation





	These accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).





	·


	Use of estimates





	In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the years reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.





	·


	Basis of consolidation





	The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of INCM and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.





	·


	Cash and cash equivalents





	Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.

	·


	Comprehensive income or loss





	ASC Topic 220,

	Comprehensive Income

	establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income or loss as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated comprehensive income or loss, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders deficit consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income or loss is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.





	·


	Income taxes





	The provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, 

	Income Taxes

	(ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.





	ASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.





	The Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to local and various foreign tax jurisdictions. The Companys tax returns remain open subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.





	·


	Net loss per share





	The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 

	Earnings per Share

	. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.





	·


	Foreign currencies translation





	Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.





	The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (US$). The Companys subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong and the PRC maintained their books and records in their local currency, Hong Kong Dollars (HK$) and Renminbi Yuan (RMB), which are functional currencies as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which these entities operate.





	In general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, 

	Translation of Financial Statement,

	using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.

	Related parties





	Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.





	·


	Fair value of financial instruments





	The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments and other receivables, accounts payable, amount due to a related party, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.





	The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, 

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	(ASC 820-10), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:






	Level 1

	:


	Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;






	Level 2

	:


	Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and






	Level 3

	:


	Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions





	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.





	·


	Recent accounting pronouncements





	In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard. The amendments in ASU 2014-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)

	. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing

	. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815) - Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 and 2014-16

	, and ASU 2016-12,

	Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients

	. These ASUs clarify the implementation guidance on a few narrow areas and adds some practical expedients to the guidance Topic 606. The Company is evaluating the effect the ASUs will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of these standards on its ongoing financial reporting.

	NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015




	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)






	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,

	Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern

	(Subtopic 205-40) which provides guidance to an organizations management, with principles and definitions that are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of disclosures that are commonly provided by organizations today in the financial statement footnotes. This guidance in ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In November 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-16,

	Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share Is More Akin to Debt or to Equity (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force)

	. The amendments permit the use of the Fed Funds Effective Swap Rate (also referred to as the Overnight Index Swap Rate, or OIS) as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes. Public business entities are required to implement the new requirements in fiscal years (and interim periods within those fiscal years) beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02

	Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis

	. ASU 2015-02 changes the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. It is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2015-02 on its consolidated financial statements.





	In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03

	Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs

	, which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The guidance will be applied retrospectively to each period presented. The adoption of this standard update is not expected to have any impact on the Companys financial statements.





	In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,

	Inventory

	, which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The effective date for the standard is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,

	Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments

	. To simplify the accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, the amendments eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for those adjustments. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-16 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,

	Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update require that deferred income tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in ASU 2015-17 are effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The amendments may be applied prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

	In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,

	Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.

	The amendments in this update require all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The amendments in ASU 2016-01 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,

	Leases (Topic 842)

	. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,

	Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting

	, which eliminates the requirement to apply the equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard should be applied prospectively for investments that qualify for the equity method of accounting after the effective date. The Company does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,

	Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

	, which includes amendments to accounting for income taxes at settlement, forfeitures, and net settlements to cover withholding taxes. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2016-09 will have on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.





	In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13,

	Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)

	, which requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.





	In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,

	Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments

	. ASU 2016-15 clarifies the presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on its financial statements and related disclosures.





	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,

	Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory

	. This ASU improves the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. This ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of this ASU to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

	In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17,

	Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are Under Common Control

	. The amendments in this ASU change how a reporting entity that is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that variable interest entity. The ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.





	In November 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-18 (ASU 2016-18),

The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in the ASU should be adopted on a retrospective basis. The Company does not expect that adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.





	The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.

	AMOUNT DUE TO A RELATED PARTY






	As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, amount due to a related party represented temporary advances made by a director and a major shareholder of the Company, Mr. William Hui, which was unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term.

	For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company generated no operating result and accordingly, no provision for income tax has been recorded.





	As of December 31, 2016, the PRC operation incurred $1,851,211 of net operating losses carryforward available for income tax purposes that may be used to offset future taxable income and will begin to expire in 5 years from the year of incurrence, if unutilized.

	(a)


	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures







	Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2016, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.


	 


	(b)


	Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting




	 


	Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:





	·


	pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;





	·


	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with management authorization, and





	·


	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.





	Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.





	Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, the companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework.





	Based on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.


	 


	(c)

	Changes in Internal Controls



	 


	No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Item 11. Executive Compensation







	COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS








	Background and Compensation Philosophy







	Our
	board
	of
	directors
	consists of six
	individuals
	: (1) Hui Yan Sui, William, our Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board and beneficial owner of 89.61% of our common stock; (2) Tang Chin Pang, Eric, our Executive Director; (3) Cheung Wai Hung, Eddie, our Chief Financial Officer; (4) Tan Ah Mee, a non-executive director; (5) Lau Yiu Nam, Eric, a non-executive director and (6) Qian Jian Yu, Mike, a non-executive director. Our
	board
	of
	directors have
	historically determined the compensation to be paid to
	our
	executive officers based on
	our
	financial and operating performance and prospects, the level of compensation paid to similarly situated executives in comparably sized companies and contributions made by the officers to
	our
	success. Each of the named officers will be measured by a series of performance criteria by the board of directors, or the compensation committee when it is established, on a yearly basis. Such criteria will be set forth based on certain objective parameters such as job characteristics, required professionalism, management skills, interpersonal skills, related experience, personal performance and overall corporate performance.






	12










	Our
	board
	of
	directors have
	not adopted or established a formal policy or procedure for determining the amount of compensation paid to our executive officers. Mr. Hui Yan Sui, William, Mr. Tang Chin Pang, Eric and Mr. Cheung Wai Hung, Eddie
	have been and may continue to be involved when our board of directors deliberate compensation issues related
	to their compensation.





	As our executive leadership and b
	oard
	of
	directors grow
	, our
	board
	of
	directors
	may decide to form a compensation committee charged with the oversight of executive compensation plans, policies and programs.







	Elements of Compensation







	We provide our executive officers solely with a base salary to compensate them for services rendered during the year. Our policy of compensating our executives with a cash salary has served
	us
	well. Because of our history of attracting and retaining executive talent, we do not believe it is necessary at this time to provide our executives discretionary bonuses, equity incentives, or other benefits
	in order
	for
	us
	to continue to be successful.







	Base Salary







	The yearly base salary of Mr. Cheung Wai Hung, Eddie for 2016 was $54,112 (2015: $54,179). Mr. Hui Yan Sui, William and Mr. Tang Chin Pang, Eric received no salary in 2016 and 2015.







	Discretionary Bonus







	We have not provided our executive officers with any discretionary bonuses at the moment but our
	board
	of
	directors
	may consider the necessity of such scheme in the future based on
	our
	financial and operating performance and prospects, the level of compensation paid to similarly situated executives in comparably sized companies and contributions made by the officers to
	our
	success









	Equity Incentives







	We
	have not established equity based incentive program and have not granted stock based awards as a component of compensation. In the future, we may adopt and establish an equity incentive plan pursuant to which awards may be granted if our
	board
	of
	directors
	determines that it is in the best
	interests
	of
	our
	stockholders
	and the Company
	to do so.







	Retirement Benefits







	Our executive officers are not presently entitled to company-sponsored retirement benefits.







	Perquisites







	We have not provided our executive officers with any material perquisites and other personal benefits and, therefore, we do not view perquisites as a significant or necessary element of our executives compensation.







	Deferred Compensation







	We do not provide our executives the opportunity to defer receipt of annual compensation.






	13











	SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE






	The following table sets forth the cash and non-cash compensation for the years indicated earned by or awarded to Hui Yan Sui, William, our Chief Executive Officer, Cheung Wai Hung, Eddie, our Chief Financial Officer, and our other executive officers and employees whose total cash compensation exceeded $120,000, or the Named Executive Officers and employees, in fiscal year 2016.

	SPECIAL NOTE ON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS






	This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by forward-looking statements.





	In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, expects, plans, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, proposed, intended, or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other forward-looking information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Annual Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017




	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)




	(Unaudited)







	NOTE

	－

	1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION






	The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (

	“

	GAAP

	”

	), and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading.





	In the opinion of management, the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016 which has been derived from audited financial statements and these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary to state fairly the results for the periods presented. The results for the period ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 or for any future period.





	These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the Management

	’

	s Discussion and the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.






	NOTE

	－

	2. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND






	Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. (the

	“

	Company

	”

	or

	“

	INCM) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 1998. On June 20, 2006, the Company changed its name from Dolphin Productions, Inc. to Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.





	We are a shell company with no or nominal operations. We are actively considering various acquisition targets and other business opportunities. We hope to acquire one or more operating businesses or consummate a business opportunity within the next twelve months.





	INCM and its subsidiaries are hereinafter referred to as (the Company

	”

	).






	NOTE

	－

	3. GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTIES






	The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.





	For the period ended March 31, 2017, the Company has experienced a continuous loss of $17,268 with an accumulated deficit of $13,426,597 as of that date. The continuation of the Company as a going concern through March 31, 2017 is dependent upon the continued financial support from its stockholders. Management believes this funding will continue, and is also actively seeking new investors. Management believes the existing stockholders will provide the additional cash to meet the Companys obligations as they become due, and will allow its planned principal business to commence and assembly the production lines of mobile handsets and components in the PRC.





	These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets and liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.

	4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes.





	l


	Shell company





	The Company has ceased all of its business and is currently considered as a shell company.





	l


	Use of estimates





	In preparing these condensed consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the balance sheets and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.





	l


	Basis of consolidation





	The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of INCM and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company balances and transactions within the Company have been eliminated upon consolidation.





	l


	Cash and cash equivalents





	Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.





	l


	Comprehensive income or loss





	ASC Topic 220,

	Comprehensive Income

	establishes standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income or loss, its components and accumulated balances. Comprehensive income or loss as defined includes all changes in equity during a period from non-owner sources. Accumulated comprehensive income or loss, as presented in the accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders deficit consists of changes in unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency translation. This comprehensive income or loss is not included in the computation of income tax expense or benefit.





	l


	Income taxes





	The Company adopts ASC Topic 740

	Income Taxes

	, regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes the recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. In addition, the guidance requires the determination of whether the benefits of tax positions will be more likely than not sustained upon audit based upon the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, a company recognizes the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not determined to be more likely than not sustained upon audit, a company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. The guidance provides for de-recognition, classification, penalties and interest, accounting in interim periods and disclosure.







	The Company did not have any unrecognized tax positions or benefits and there was no effect on the financial condition or results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to local and various foreign tax jurisdictions. The Companys tax returns remain open subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions.

	(Unaudited)






	l


	Net loss per share





	The Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260,

	Earnings per Share

	. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.





	l


	Foreign currencies translation





	Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the statement of operations.





	The reporting currency of the Company is United States Dollars (US$). The Companys subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong and the PRC maintained their books and records in their local currency, Hong Kong Dollars (HK$) and Renminbi Yuan (RMB), which are functional currencies as being the primary currency of the economic environment in which these entities operate.





	In general, assets and liabilities are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, 

	Translation of Financial Statement

	, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income within the statement of stockholders equity.





	Translation of amounts from RMB and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective period:

















	 




	 





	March 31, 2017





	 





	March 31, 2016







	Period-end RMB:US$1 exchange rate

	6.4479






	Average period RMB:US$1 exchange rate




	 




	6.8882




	 




	6.5395






	Period-end HK$:US$1 exchange rate

	l


	Related parties





	Parties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.





	l


	Fair value of financial instruments





	The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, prepayments and other receivables, accounts payable, amount due to a related party, other payables and accrued liabilities approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

	NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2017




	(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)




	(Unaudited)






	The Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, 

	Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

	 (ASC 820-10), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:












	 





	Level 1

	: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;















	 





	Level 2

	: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and















	 





	Level 3

	: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions








	Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information about the financial instrument. These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.





	l


	Recent accounting pronouncements





	The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.






	NOTE

	－

	5. AMOUNT DUE TO A RELATED PARTY






	As of March 31, 2017, the balance represented temporary advances made by a director and a major stockholder of the Company, Mr. William Hui, which was unsecured, interest-free with no fixed repayment term.






	NOTE

	－

	6. INCOME TAXES






	The Company operates in various countries: United States, British Virgin Island and Hong Kong that are subject to taxes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as follows:






	United States of America






	The Company is registered in the State of Nevada and is subject to United States current tax law.






	British Virgin Island






	Under the current BVI law, the Company is not subject to tax on income.






	Hong Kong






	For the three months ended March 31, 2017, no provision for Hong Kong Profits Tax is made for as the Companys income neither arises in, nor is derived from Hong Kong under its applicable tax law.






	NOTE

	－

	7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES






	For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company utilized office space of a director and stockholder at no charge. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein.






	NOTE

	－

	SUBSEQUENT EVENTS






	The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements were issued and filed with this Form 10-Q. There were no subsequent events that required recognition or disclosure.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PLAN OF OPERATION






	The following review concerns three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, which should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto presented in the Form 10-K.

	History






	Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc. (the Company or INCM) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 1998.





	On June 20, 2006, the Company changed its name from Dolphin Productions, Inc. to Innocom Technology Holdings, Inc.





	On January 19, 2007, Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology Limited is incorporated and registered in the Peoples Republic of China (the PRC).





	On May 16, 2007, the Company purchased a 10 years mobile phone manufacturing license in a consideration of RMB45 million (approximately $5,770,000) and annual license fee of RMB500,000 (approximately $64,000). The license was terminated on February, 2009.





	On May 8, 2008, the Company completed the establishment of a new subsidiary, Changzhou Innocom Communication Technology Limited in the PRC upon the approval of its local government.





	In February 2009, the Company ceased its principal operation in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. The Company intends to continue to operate the manufacturing facility depending upon the market recovery condition and demands from the customers.





	In February 2012, we established a new Hong Kong subsidiary company, named Lead Faith International Trading Limited, to explore possible trading business. We disposed of this subsidiary at cost in April 2012.





	On September 17, 2013, the Company filed an amendment with the Nevada Secretary of State to our Articles of Incorporation authorizing an increase of our authorized common stock from 50,000,000 common shares to 490,000,000 common shares, par value $0.001 and authorizing 10,000,000 preferred shares, par value $0.001 per share.






	Overview and Future Plan of Operations






	In February 2009, the Company determined to have a closure in the manufacturing facility in Changzhou City, Zhejiang Province, the PRC. Starting from the fourth quarter 2008, global economic conditions have deteriorated significantly across the countries and the demand for communication products and components was adversely slowed down. During such challenging economic times, the Company discontinued operation in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC. However, the Company has no intention to dispose of the production facilities. We are seeking production contracts, both volume and operating contribution of which warrant us to start the production facilities again. We have expended several million establishing our manufacturing facilities. Despite the fact that we have written down the value of the manufacturing facility we have no intention to dispose of it. We continue to seek out production contracts for the facility. We will need to privately offer and sell shares in order to finance initial working capital should we resume production.






	12
















	In February 2012, we established a new Hong Kong subsidiary company, named Lead Faith International Trading Limited, to explore possible trading business. We disposed of this subsidiary at cost in April 2012 because after further review we considered subsidiaries business model as not viable.






	Results of Operations for Three Months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016






	During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we experienced a net loss of $17,268 compared to a net loss of $42,971 for three months ended March 31, 2016. The loss represents total general and administrative expenses for the period.






	Revenue






	We did not have trading business for both three months ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016. As a result of discontinuation of our business and operations in the manufacture of mobile communication products and components in the PRC, we had no revenue recorded for both three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016.






	Administrative Expenses






	Administrative expenses mainly included salaries and professional fees.






	Net Loss






	Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $17,268 compared to net loss of $42,971 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Losses of both periods represent the total general and administrative expenses for the periods. The loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 deceased as compared with the loss for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This is essentially attributable to decrease of travelling expenses.






	Trends, Events, and Uncertainties






	N/A






	Liquidity and Capital Resources for Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016







	Cash flows from operating activities






	We experienced negative cash flows used in operations in the amount of $580 for three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared with negative cash flow used in the operations in the amount of $8,404 for three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease of negative cash flows is due to increase of other payables and accrued liabilities for the three months ended 2017.





	As the Company did not have any revenue during both periods, the cash flows used in operations represented general and administrative expenses paid from related party loan proceeds.






	Cash flows from investing activities






	During three months ended March 31, 2017, we had no investing activities.





	During three months ended March 31, 2016, we had no investing activities.






	Cash flows from financing activities






	We experienced positive cash flow advanced from a related party in the amount of $682 and $9,767 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.





	The related party advance was an interest free loan under oral agreement without repayment period, repayment of which depends upon future profitable operations or may be made by capitalization issue of new shares.






	Liquidity






	On a long-term basis, our liquidity will be dependent on establishing profitable operations, receipt of revenues, additional infusions of capital and additional financing. If necessary, we may raise capital through an equity or debt offering. The funds raised from such an offering would be used to develop and execute our business plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital, our growth potential will be adversely affected. Additionally, we will have to significantly modify our plans.






	13

















	Critical Accounting Policies






	The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.


	 


	Details of critical accounting policies are set out in notes to the financial statements included in Item 1.






	Employees

	 





	As of March 31, 2017 we had approximately 2 full-time employees employed in Hong Kong. From time to time we employ independent contractors to support our production, engineering, marketing, and sales departments.

	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
