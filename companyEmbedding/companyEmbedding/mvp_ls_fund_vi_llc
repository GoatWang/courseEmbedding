How would you describe your past investing experiences?

If you answered "Frustrating," "disappointing" or "confusing," then you're certainly not alone. Perhaps the most common mistake investors make is to let emotions drive their investment decisions. So, how do you keep emotions in check and avoid making common investing mistakes? First, it makes sense to get assistance from a financial professional - someone who can help you develop strategies to meet your specific needs. In addition, research shows that strategies built upon the principles of asset allocation and diversification can help you reduce risk and earn more consistent performance over time.
As financial products become more complex, we offer a simple way to overcome the emotion of investing and help you pursue your investment objectives - the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios.

A unique investment solution that can offer powerful, long-term benefits

With Lifestyle portfolios you gain access to a sophisticated asset allocation and diversification process managed by experienced professionals. These portfolios invest in a number of other mutual funds and are designed to meet your particular investment objectives - by offering varying levels of risk and return potential.

Discover the John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolios

Work with your financial professional today to evaluate your financial situation and goals. Your advisor can help you select the appropriate John Hancock Lifestyle Portfolio for your personal needs and risk tolerance.
Asset allocation does not ensure a profit or protection against loss. Please note that asset allocation may not be appropriate for all investors, particularly those interested in directing the underlying funds on their own. A Lifestyle Portfolio is subject to the same risks as the underlying funds in which it invests, which include the following risks. Stocks and bonds can decline due to adverse issuer, market, regulatory or economic developments. Investing in foreign securities is subject to certain risks not associated with domestic investing such as currency fluctuations and changes in political and economic conditions. The securities of small capitalization companies are subject to higher volatility than larger, more established companies. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks, such as the increased risk of default. Before making an investment in a Lifestyle Portfolio, you should consider all the risks associated with it.Click here  to view the Lifestyle Portfolios Prospectus.
