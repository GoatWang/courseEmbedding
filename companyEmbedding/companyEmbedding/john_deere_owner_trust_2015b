September 09, 2015 04:15 PM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings to the John Deere Owner 
      Trust 2015-B (JDOT 2015-B) notes:
    

      --$228,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$245,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$203,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$75,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,260,178 certificates not rated.
    

      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled 'John Deere Owner Trust 2015-B', dated Aug. 20, 
      2015, which is available on Fitch's web site. The presale report details 
      how Fitch addresses the key rating drivers summarized below.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Concentration of Agricultural Equipment (AG): JDOT 2015-B is 
      comprised of approximately 75% AG equipment, consistent with the prior 
      transactions dating back to 2011. While AG equipment historical losses 
      have been low, the high concentration in the pool limits 
      diversification. However, geographic diversity, diversification within 
      the AG sector, and equipment versatility help mitigate the high 
      concentration.
    

      Consistent Collateral Concentrations: The pool contains 75.3% AG and 
      24.7% construction equipment (CO). These concentrations are consistent 
      with those of JDOT 2015. Furthermore, the pool consists of 64.4% 
      annual-pay contracts, which historically have experienced a lower level 
      of losses versus other payment types.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) for 
      JDOT 2015-B is 3.50%, unchanged from JDOT 2015. The initial reserve in 
      JDOT 2015-B is 1.00%, while the subordinated certificates provide 2.50% 
      enhancement. Initial excess spread in JDOT 2015-B is expected to be 
      approximately 1.56%, down from 1.73% in JDOT 2015. Under Fitch's 'AAAsf' 
      scenario, CE for the class A notes was able to withstand more than 5.0x 
      the expected net loss rate of 1.00%.
    

      Stable Origination, Underwriting and Servicing: JDCC has demonstrated 
      strong capabilities as originator, underwriter and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical delinquency and loss performance of securitized 
      trusts and its managed portfolio. All securitizations issued and rated 
      by Fitch have performed within initial base case expectations.
    

      Integrity of Legal Structure: The legal structure of the transaction 
      should provide that a bankruptcy of the trust would not impair the 
      timeliness of payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings to increased losses over the 
      life of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the notes display 
      limited sensitivity to increased defaults and losses, showing limited 
      impact on the rating of the notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case 
      loss) scenario. The notes could experience downgrades of up to two 
      rating categories under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Additionally, Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence 
      information from Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence 
      focused on comparing or recalculating certain information with respect 
      to 120 receivables. Fitch considered this information in its analysis 
      and the findings did not have an impact on our analysis/conclusions. A 
      copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection 
      with this transaction may be obtained through the link contained on the 
      bottom of the related rating action commentary (RAC).
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      presale report dated Aug. 20, 2015. Fitch's analysis of the 
      Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this transaction can be found in 
      ' John Deere Owner Trust 2015-B - Appendix'. These R&Ws are compared to 
      those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the

      Fitch Affirms John Deere Owner Trust 2015-B
    





July 20, 2016 09:49 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings affirms all outstanding classes of John Deere Owner Trust 
      2015-B as follows:
    

      --Class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of the class A notes reflect loss coverage levels 
      consistent with the current ratings. As of the July 2016 reporting 
      period, cumulative net losses (CNL) totaled 12 basis points, and as 
      such, the transaction is extrapolating below Fitch's initial base case 
      loss proxy. The Stable Outlook for all classes reflects Fitch's 
      expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to 
      improve as the transaction amortizes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case 
      loss expectations, subsequently impacting available loss coverage. Lower 
      loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the 
      extent of the decline in coverage.
    

      In Fitch's initial review of the transaction, the notes were found to 
      have limited sensitivity to 1.5x and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case 
      loss expectations. Initial key rating drivers and rating sensitivities 
      are further described in the presale report dated Sept. 9, 2015.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

As of the November 2016 reporting period, cumulative net losses aggregated to 21 basis points (bps) and 18 bps for JDOT 2014 and 2015, respectively. Both transactions are extrapolating below Fitch's initial base case proxies. The Stable Outlook for all classes reflects Fitch's expectation for loss coverage and credit enhancement to continue to improve as the transaction amortizes.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxies which would impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage. In Fitch's initial review of the transactions, the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to 1.5x and 2.5x higher of Fitch's base case loss expectations.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 26 Oct 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/888492Criteria for Rating U.S. Equipment Lease and Loan ABS (pub. 03 Dec 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/874138Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1016696Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1016696Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.Read MoreThe information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
