of such partnership interests, indirectly through Genco GP LLC and Genco LP LLC.

     2.2 Genco Contracts. On the Genco Organization Date, REI will cause to be
assigned to Genco the Technical Services Agreement between REI and Resources and
Genco will assume the obligations of REI thereunder.

     2.3 Organization of Genco. Prior to the Genco Public Ownership Date, Regco
shall organize Genco and contribute to Genco all of Regco's interests in Genco
GP LLC and Genco LP LLC. Immediately following such transactions, all
outstanding shares of Genco Common Stock shall be owned by Regco, unless at such
time the Restructuring Merger shall not have been effected, in which case all
outstanding shares of Genco Common Stock shall be owned by REI. In connection
with the organization of Genco, REI shall cause Genco's certificate of
incorporation to contain a provision electing not to be governed by Section 203
of the Delaware General Corporation Law or Articles 13.01 et seq. of the Texas
Business Corporation Act, as applicable.

     2.4 Genco Employee Matters. Effective no later than the earlier of the
Distribution Date and January 1, 2002, REI shall transfer to Genco LP all
personnel employed by REI who are assigned to generating plants and other
facilities owned by Genco LP, together with other employees identified by REI as
energy production employees who are directly supporting the functions of Genco
LP. Prior to such effective date, REI shall complete any necessary consultations
with labor organizations. In accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, REI
shall cause benefit and welfare plans to be in place for employees of Genco as
of the effective date of the transfer of employment.

                                  ARTICLE III
                                 Grant of Option

     3.1 Grant of Option. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance on
the representations and warranties herein set forth, REI hereby grants to
Resources the option to purchase, during the Option Period, all (but not less
than all) of the shares of Genco Common Stock owned by Regco at the time of
exercise (which shall not include the shares of Genco Common Stock sold or
distributed in the Genco Public Ownership Event) for an aggregate price equal to
the sum of (a) the product of (x) the average daily closing price per share of
the Genco Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which
the Genco Common Stock is traded over the 30 consecutive trading days out of the
120 trading days ending 


                                       9
   13

January 9, 2004 (the "Pricing Period") which result in the highest average
closing price for any such 30 trading day period and (y) the number of shares of
Genco Common Stock so owned by Regco, (b) any applicable Control Premium Amount
and (c) any adjustment (whether positive or negative) required by Section 7.9.
The Option shall also be exercisable prior to the Option Period in the
circumstances set forth in Section 3.5 for the price and on the terms set forth
therein. The Control Premium Amount shall apply to the extent that the PUCT
includes a control premium in the valuation of Genco pursuant to Section
39.262(h)(3) of the Utilities Code, and shall equal the amount of the control
premium so determined to exist, but shall in no event exceed 10% of the amount
determined under clause (a) of the first sentence of this Section 3.1. In the
event of any stock dividend, stock split or combination affecting the Genco
Common Stock during the Pricing Period, appropriate proportionate adjustments
shall be made in the computation of the average daily closing price pursuant to
this Section 3.1.

     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Option shall not be
exercisable unless the Distribution (as defined in the Master Separation
Agreement) has occurred. If at any time the Option is exercisable hereunder the
Restructuring Date has not occurred, or for any other reason the Genco Common
Stock is held by REI or one or more other Subsidiaries of REI or Regco rather
than by Regco, the Option shall be an option to purchase all of the Genco Common
Stock held by REI or such other Subsidiary or Subsidiaries.

     3.2 Exercise of Option. Resources may exercise the Option by giving written
notice thereof to Regco during the Option Period. Subject to compliance with
Section 3.3, and to satisfaction of the Regulatory Conditions to Exercise,
delivery of and payment for the Shares (assuming the Option has been so
exercised) shall be made at 10:00 A.M., Houston time, on the later of (a) the
third business day following the giving of such notice (or such other date as
the parties agree) and (b) the first business day following the satisfaction of
the Regulatory Conditions to Exercise (satisfaction of which shall be a
condition precedent to such delivery and payment) (which date shall be the
"Option Closing Date"), provided that if the amount of any Control Premium
Amount included in the exercise price has not been determined by Final Order of
the PUCT prior to the date for delivery and payment so determined, the payment
made on the date so determined shall exclude any Control Premium Amount and such
Control Premium Amount shall be paid in immediately available funds no later
than 5 business days after the PUCT issues a Final Order determining market
value under Section 39.262(h)(3) of the Utilities Code. Delivery of the Shares
shall be made to Resources against payment by Resources of the purchase price by
wire transfer payable in same-day funds to the account specified by Regco.
Delivery of the Shares shall be made by delivery to Resources of stock
certificates representing the Shares, accompanied by appropriate stock powers or
other instruments in proper form to effect such transfer. If Resources
determines prior to the Option Period and within one year prior to the
anticipated Option Closing Date that it intends in good faith, subject to
economic conditions and other reasonable assumptions identified at such time, to
exercise the Option, it and Regco shall make all appropriate regulatory filings,
including filings under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
("H-S-R") and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, with a view to obtaining
required approvals or expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
prior to the Option Exercise Date. Regco and Resources shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all other Regulatory Conditions to Exercise to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable after the Option Exercise Date.


                                       10
   14

     If Resources exercises the Option and all other Regulatory Conditions to
Exercise have not been satisfied by the expiration or termination of the H-S-R
waiting period, Resources shall deposit the payment for the Shares in an
interest bearing account with an escrow agent mutually acceptable to Resources
and Regco, and Genco shall execute a power sales agreement with Resources under
which Genco shall sell to Resources or its designee all of Genco's available
capacity (after deducting requirements to satisfy prior obligations and amounts
it is required to sell to third parties under PUCT rules) at market-based rates
until the earlier of the Option Closing Date described above and May 31, 2005.
At the Option Closing Date, the escrow agent holding the payment for the shares
shall remit to Regco the entire amount deposited by Resources, plus all interest
accrued and unpaid to the Option Closing Date, net of dividends paid to Regco
during the period such funds are held in escrow. During the continuation of the
power sales agreement, Resources shall be obligated to advance, on the same
terms credit is extended by Regco pursuant to Section 6.5, all amounts required
by Genco for capital expenditures, and shall also pay for power purchased under
the power sales agreement pursuant to the terms thereof. If the Option Closing
Date has not occurred by May 31, 2005, the rights of the parties under this
Agreement shall terminate (except for the obligations of Regco to reimburse
Resources as set forth in the next sentence), the escrow shall be terminated and
all funds deposited with the escrow agent, together with interest accrued
thereon, shall be paid to Resources. Within five business days following such
termination, Regco shall cause Genco to repay, or shall otherwise reimburse
Resources for, all unrepaid advances made to fund Genco's capital expenditures
during the continuation of the power sales agreement as provided above.

     3.3 Requirement to Purchase Notes and Receivables. It shall be a condition
to Resource's right to exercise the Option that Resources shall purchase from
Regco (or any Subsidiary of Regco, as applicable) any notes and other
receivables owed by Genco to Regco or any Subsidiary of Regco as of the Option
Closing Date (other than Indebtedness incurred pursuant to Section 6.5 which
establishes specified terms for repayment, the repayment of which shall be
governed by the terms thereof), at an amount equal to the outstanding principal
amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon to such date. If
there are any notes or other receivables owed by Regco or any Subsidiary of
Regco to Genco as of the Option Closing Date, Resources shall assume the
obligations of the obligors on such notes and other receivables and in
consideration for the making of such assumption, Regco shall pay (or cause its
Subsidiary obligor to pay, as applicable) to Resources an amount equal to the
outstanding principal amount thereof plus any accrued and unpaid interest
thereon to such date. Regco shall provide an estimate of such amounts owed by
and to Genco and reasonably available supporting detail within two business days
following any request by Resources during the Option Period or during the ten
business days prior thereto, and within one business day after the giving of the
notice of exercise pursuant to Section 3.2. The estimated amounts notified to
Resources following the giving of the notice of exercise shall be paid by
Resources, or by Regco or the appropriate Subsidiary obligor, as applicable, in
same-day funds at the same time payment is made for the purchase of the Shares.
Any variation in the actual amounts outstanding as of the Option Closing Date
from the estimated amounts on the basis of which payment was made on the Option
Closing Date shall be determined as soon as practicable and payments made from
Resources to Regco, or from Regco to Resources, as applicable, so that the
amounts paid on the Option Closing Date, as adjusted to reflect such additional
payments, are equal to the amounts payable on the basis of the actual amounts
outstanding.


                                       11
   15

     3.4 Regulatory Conditions to Exercise. (a) The purchase and sale of the
Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Option shall be subject to the
satisfaction of following conditions precedent (collectively, the "Regulatory
Conditions to Exercise"):

          (i) any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
     Antitrust Improvements Act shall have expired or been terminated; and

          (ii) any approval by the SEC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission or any
     other regulatory agency then having jurisdiction over the transfer of the
     Shares upon exercise of the Option or the ownership by Resources of the
     Shares that is required by law to be obtained prior to the transfer of the
     Shares or in order for Resources to exercise full rights of ownership with
     respect thereto shall have been obtained and shall be in full force and
     effect.

          (b) Regco shall use its best efforts to expedite all regulatory
approvals, including initiation of share transfer approval proceedings before
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission prior to the Option Exercise Date as soon as
reasonably practical after receiving a non-binding notice from Resources prior
to the commencement of the Option Period stating that the current intention of
Resources is to exercise the Option.

     3.5 Regco Change in Control. If a Regco Change in Control Event occurs, and
the Pricing Period specified in Section 3.1 has not been completed, then the
Option shall become exercisable on the terms specified in this Section 3.5,
including the modifications set forth in this Section 3.5 to the determination
of the exercise price therefor and the time and manner of payment of the
exercise price. In such event, Resources may exercise the option by giving
written notice thereof to Regco at any time after the occurrence of the Regco
Change in Control Event (provided the Genco Public Ownership Date has occurred
and at least 30 trading days have occurred thereafter) and prior to the Option
Expiration Date. If the Pricing Period has not been completed at the time the
notice of exercise is given, the option price payable on the Option Closing Date
shall be determined on the same basis as set forth in Section 3.1 except that
the Pricing Period shall be the 30 consecutive trading days out of the 120
trading days (or if there have not been 120 trading days, out of such shorter
period during which trading has occurred) ending on the date the notice of
exercise is given. At such time as the Option Period would have commenced absent
the occurrence of a Regco Change in Control Event a computation of the exercise
price shall be made in accordance with Section 3.1, including the determination
of any Control Premium Amount, and if that computation results in an exercise
price lower than has been paid by Resources on the Option Closing Date, the
difference shall be repaid by Regco to Resources as an adjustment to the
exercise price. There shall be no such adjustment if such computation results in
an exercise price higher than that paid on the Option Closing Date. Except as
modified by this Section 3.5, the provisions of Article III shall apply to any
exercise of the Option pursuant to this Section 3.5.

     3.6 Prohibitions on Market Activity. Prior to the Option Exercise Date or,
if the option is not exercised, the Option Expiration Date, neither REI,
Resources nor Genco shall, directly or indirectly through any Subsidiary or
other Person, purchase, sell, contract to purchase or sell, or otherwise acquire
or dispose of, any shares of Genco Common Stock or any options, 


                                       12
   16

warrants, rights, convertible securities or other securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for Genco Common Stock.

     3.7 Distributions, etc. Pending the Option Closing Date. On and after the
commencement of the Pricing Period through and including the Option Closing
Date, Genco shall not declare any dividend or other distribution with respect to
the Genco Common Stock except for Regular Quarterly Dividends consistent with
past practices.

     3.8 Commitments Pending the Option Closing Date. On and after the Option
Exercise Date through and including the Option Closing Date, Genco shall not
enter into any long term contract or commitment for the purchase of fuel or for
the purchase or sale of power (including any such contract or commitment
reasonably expected to require performance or payment after the Option Closing
Date) without prior consultation with, and the consent of, Resources, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

     3.9 Regulatory Proceedings. To the extent permitted by court or agency
rules, Resources shall be entitled to participate jointly with Regco in all
Regulatory Proceedings (as defined in the Master Separation Agreement)
pertaining in any way to the value of Genco or to the Option.

                                   ARTICLE IV
                      Representations and Warranties of REI

a valid and binding obligation of REI.

     4.2 No Breach or Default. None of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by REI or the assumption or performance by Regco of the

REI or similar constituent documents of Regco or of any note, mortgage,
indenture, loan or credit agreement, contract or other agreement to which either

the exercise of the Option will be duly authorized and validly issued, fully

partnership interests of Genco LP will be validly issued, and following the
transactions described in Section 2.3, Genco will be the sole beneficial owner
thereof (indirectly through Genco GP LLC and Genco LP LLC). At all times during
the Option Period and prior to

   17

the Option Closing Date Regco will be the record and beneficial owner of the
Shares free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities and claims, and
assuming that Resources acquires the Shares upon payment therefor as provided in
Section 3.2 without notice of any adverse claim (within the meaning of Section
8.105 of the Texas Business and Commerce Code (the "UCC")), no action based on
an adverse claim (within the meaning of Section 8.105 of the UCC) may be
asserted against Resources with respect to the Shares.

                   Representations and Warranties of Resources

Delaware. All necessary corporate action on the part of Resources to authorize
the entering into and performance of this Agreement has been duly and validly
taken. This Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Resources.

     5.2 No Breach or Default. None of the execution, delivery or performance of
this Agreement by Resources will constitute a breach of or a default under any

note, mortgage, indenture, loan or credit agreement, contract or other agreement
to which Resources is a party or by which it is bound or to which any of its
material assets or property is subject.

          (b) Capital expenditures for environmental compliance projects
reflected in the estimated expenditures set forth on Schedule 7.6(b), shall be
made unless and to the extent (i) such expenditures are determined by final
order of the PUCT no longer subject to rehearing by the PUCT not to be
recoverable as stranded costs under the Utilities Code, in which case Genco may
cease making such expenditures as are determined not to be recoverable and shall
promptly give notice to Resources of any determination to cease making such
expenditures and the basis therefor or (ii) such expenditures relate to
generation units Genco has determined, in accordance with Good Operating
Practices, to mothball, provided that prior to ceasing such expenditures Genco
shall have provided Resources with its written analysis in reasonable detail
supporting the decision to mothball the unit. It is understood that the amounts

material respects with its covenants and obligations contained in the agreements
specified in Section 2.2. Genco will, except to the extent failure to do so

material respects with all other material contracts for fuel supply and the
purchase or sale of power.

the holders of Genco Common Stock in respect thereof in connection with any
reclassification, stock dividend or stock split, (c) Genco Common Stock sold by
Genco in the IPO, (d) the sale of Shares pursuant to the Option, or (e) in the
event the Genco Public Ownership Event is a Genco IPO which does not result in
Regco's ownership of the outstanding Genco Common Stock being reduced to 81% or
less, the sale prior to the commencement of the Pricing Period of Shares, in an
amount sufficient to result in a Reduction of Regco's ownership of the
outstanding Genco Common Stock to such level, but not below 80%, so that Regco
may use the partial stock valuation method specified in Section 39.262(h)(3) of
the Utilities Code.

     7.9 Dividends; No Repurchases of Capital Stock. For the period beginning on
the Genco Public Ownership Date and extending through the end of the Pricing
Period, Genco shall establish a dividend policy under which it will distribute
to its shareholders through regular quarterly cash dividends complying with this
Section 7.9 ("Regular Cash Dividends") all its annual earnings which it may
lawfully distribute to shareholders under corporate law or applicable regulatory
restrictions. The goal of such policy shall be to pay out through dividends all
earnings and at the same time maintain consistent levels of dividend payments
during the year without requiring unusual or large payments. To implement such
payment policy, the initial Genco dividend set at the Genco Public Ownership
Date shall be based on estimated earnings for the remainder of the calendar year
in which the Genco Public Ownership Date occurs. To the extent that dividends
paid for that year are greater or less than actual earnings for that year, the
Regular Cash Dividend for the ensuing calendar year shall be increased or
decreased as appropriate to reflect that overage or underage in earnings paid
out.

     If Resources exercises the Option, the purchase price for the Shares shall
be adjusted for the difference between:

          (a) the actual earnings per share of Genco through the earlier of (x)
     the Option Closing Date or (y) if the Option Closing Date is delayed as
     contemplated in Section 3.2, the date Resources deposits payment for the
     Shares with an escrow agent pursuant to such Section multiplied by the
     shares owned by Regco, and

          (b) the dividends paid by Genco to Regco to that date.

     To the extent dividends paid for each Share have been less than the per
share earnings of Genco, the Option Price shall be adjusted upward for the
difference, and to the extent dividends paid exceed actual earnings to that
date, the option price shall be credited with that difference.


                                       18
   22

     From and after the Genco Public Ownership Date, Genco will not declare, set
aside or pay any dividend payable in cash, stock or property, except for (a)
Regular Cash Dividends, or (b) dividends payable solely in Genco Common Stock
for which, if occurring during the Pricing Period, an adjustment is made
pursuant to Section 3.1. Genco will not, and will not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, purchase or otherwise acquire for value any shares of Genco
Common Stock.

     7.10 Indebtedness. Following the Genco Public Ownership Date, Genco will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, incur, assume or otherwise
become liable in respect of any Indebtedness except to satisfy requirements for
operating and maintenance expenditures and capital expenditures in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, to meet working capital needs and to refund or
refinance Indebtedness incurred for any of the foregoing purposes. Genco will
not, and will not permit and of its Subsidiaries to, incur, assume or otherwise
become liable in respect of any Indebtedness incurred for the purpose of making
any expenditure in violation of Section 7.12.

     7.11 Negative Pledge. Genco will not pledge, mortgage, hypothecate or grant
a security interest in, or permit any mortgage, pledge, security interest or
other lien upon, any Genco Assets to secure any Indebtedness, provided, however,
that this restriction shall not apply to or prevent the creation or existence
of:

          (a) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance upon
     any property or assets created at the time of the acquisition of such
     property or assets by Genco or within one year after such time to secure
     all or a portion of the purchase price for such property or assets;

          (b) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance upon
     any property or assets existing thereon at the time of the acquisition
     thereof by Genco (whether or not the obligations secured thereby are
     assumed by Genco or any Subsidiary);

          (c) any extension, renewal or refunding of any mortgage, pledge,
     security interest, lien or encumbrance permitted by subsection (a) or (b)
     above on substantially the same property or assets theretofore subject
     thereto;

          (d) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance in
     favor of Genco; or

          (e) any mortgage, pledge, security interest, lien or encumbrance
     created or assumed by Genco in connection with the issuance of debt
     securities the interest on which is excludable from gross income of the
     holder of such security pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
     amended, for the purpose of financing, in whole or in part, the acquisition
     or construction of property or assets to be used by Genco.

     For the purpose of this Section 7.11, "security interest" shall include the
interest of the lessor under a lease with a term of three years or more that
should be, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, recorded
as a capital lease, and any such lease of 


                                       19
   23

property or assets not acquired from Genco in contemplation of such lease shall
be treated as though the lessee had purchased such property or assets from the
lessor.

     7.12 Other Negative Covenants. Genco will not, except as (x) contemplated
by this Agreement, (y) described in Schedule 7.12, or (z) required under
applicable law or by any Governmental Authority:

          7.12.1 Make any material change in the levels of inventories

     ordinary course of business consistent with past practices of Genco or,
     prior to the Genco Organization Date, REI and Good Operating Practices)
     other than encumbrances not securing any Indebtedness that arise in the
     ordinary course of business and do not detract from or interfere with in
     any material respect the value or use of such assets and pledges,
     mortgages, security interests or other liens securing Indebtedness of Genco
     or a Subsidiary of Genco permitted under Section 7.11.

          7.12.3 Modify, amend or voluntarily terminate prior to the applicable

     the Permits or Environmental Permits associated with the Genco Assets in
     any material respect, other than (a) in the ordinary course of business, to
     the extent consistent with the past practices of Genco or REI and with Good
     Operating Practices, or (b) with cause, to the extent consistent with past
     practices of Genco or REI or with Good Operating Practices.

          7.12.4 Merge or consolidate with or into, or convey, transfer, lease

     (whether now owned or hereafter acquired) to, any Person.

          7.12.5 Make any material change in the nature of its business as

     Person not an Affiliate of Genco, (b) transactions permitted by agreements
     specifically identified herein or in the Master Separation Agreement, (c)

     oral contract, agreement, commitment or arrangement with respect to any of
     the proscribed transactions set forth in the foregoing Section 7.12.1
     through 7.12.9.

Date, REI) will furnish to Resources:


          7.13.1 Beginning on the Genco Organization Date, as soon as available
     and in any event within 15 days after the end of each quarter, a balance

          7.13.3 Beginning on the Genco Public Ownership Date, promptly after
     the sending or filing thereof, copies of all reports that Genco sends to
     any of its security holders, and copies of all reports, registration

     7.14 Obtain PUCT Final Order. Genco will use its best efforts to obtain
prior to the beginning of the Option Period any and all Final Orders (as such
term is defined in the Master Separation Agreement) from the PUCT and any other
necessary Governmental Authority necessary for (i) the facilities (as such term
is used in Section 32 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, as
amended) of Genco to become eligible facilities (as such term is 


                                       21
   25

defined in such Act) and (ii) Genco to become an "exempt wholesale generator"
under such Act, which Final Orders shall include, without limitation, the

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               Governance Matters

Stock on any matter than is required by applicable law or any provisions which
would impose restrictions or have any other effects set forth in Section 5.3 of
the Master Separation Agreement with respect to Resources as a stockholder of
Genco or a Person who may become a stockholder of Genco. Prior to the Option
Closing Date or, if the Option is not exercised, the Option Expiration Date,

requirements of any national securities exchange or transactions reporting
system on which the Genco Common Stock is listed or quoted or (b) amendments

have any of the other effects set forth in Section 5.3 of the Master Separation
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE X
                                   Tax Matters

     10.1 Election Under Section 338(h)(10).
  

          (a) REI, for itself and on behalf of Regco ("Seller"), and Resources
     shall make a joint election for Genco under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code
     and under any comparable provisions of state or local law (an "Election")
     with respect to the purchase of the Genco Common Stock. Seller and
     Resources shall mutually execute and complete copies of IRS Form 8023 and
     any similar state or local forms no later than 60 days prior to the due
     date (including extensions) for filing such forms or the Tax Returns to
     which such forms must be attached. If any changes are required in these
     forms as a result of information that is first available after such forms
     are prepared, the parties will promptly agree on such changes.

          (b) Resources shall prepare and submit to Seller a proposed allocation
     of the Modified Adjusted Deemed Sales Price (as defined in Treasury
     Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(f)) for Genco among the assets of Genco
     as soon as practicable after the Option Closing Date. Seller shall approve
     and agree to the proposed allocation unless Seller reasonably determines
     that the proposed allocation is improper. Neither Resources nor Seller
     shall take any action inconsistent with, or fail to take any action
     necessary for, the validity of the Election, and, if an allocation schedule
     is agreed to by Resources and Seller, Resources and Seller shall adopt and
     utilize the asset values as determined on the allocation schedule for the
     purpose of all Tax Returns filed by them unless otherwise required by
     applicable law.

     10.2 Tax Returns. Seller shall cause Genco and its Subsidiaries to prepare
and file at the Seller's expense (i) all Tax Returns of Genco and its
Subsidiaries which are required to 


                                       24
   28

be filed (taking into account extensions of time to file) on or before the
Option Closing Date and (ii) all federal and state income and franchise Tax
Returns of Genco and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or prior to the
Option Closing Date. Resources shall prepare and file (or cause to be prepared
and filed) at its own expense all other Tax Returns of Genco and its
Subsidiaries. If either Resources, on the one hand, or Seller, on the other
hand, may be liable for any material portion of the Tax payable in connection
with any Tax Return to be filed by the other, the party responsible under this
Section 10.2 for filing such return (the "Preparer") shall prepare and deliver
to the other party (the "Payor") a copy of such return and any schedules, work
papers and other documentation then available that are relevant to the
preparation of the portion of such return for which the Payor is or may be
liable hereunder not later than 30 days before the Due Date (as defined in
Section 10.12 of this Agreement). The Preparer shall not file such return until
the earlier of either the receipt of written notice from the Payor indicating
the Payor's consent thereto, or the Due Date. The Payor shall have the option of
providing to the Preparer, at any time at least 15 days prior to the Due Date,
written instructions as to how the Payor wants any, or all, of the items for
which it may be liable reflected on such Tax Return. The Preparer shall, in
preparing such return, cause the items for which the Payor is liable hereunder
to be reflected in accordance with the Payor's instructions (unless, in the
opinion of nationally recognized tax counsel to the Preparer, complying with the
Payor's instructions would likely subject the Preparer to any criminal penalty
or to civil penalties) and, in the absence of having received such instructions,
in accordance with past practice.

     If the Preparer fails to satisfy its obligations pursuant to this Section
10.2, the Payor shall have no obligation to indemnify the Preparer for any Taxes
which are reflected on any such Tax Return if and to the extent the Payor was
actually prejudiced by such failure, and shall retain any and all remedies it
may otherwise have which arise out of such failure.

     10.3 Transfer Taxes. All excise, transfer, stamp, documentary, filing,
recordation and other similar taxes, together with any interest, additions or
penalties with respect thereto and any interest in respect of such additions or
penalties, resulting directly from the sale and transfer by Seller to Resources
of the Genco Common Stock (the "Transfer Taxes"), shall be borne 50% by
Resources and 50% by Seller. Notwithstanding Section 10.2 of this Agreement,
which shall not apply to Tax Returns relating to Transfer Taxes, any Tax Returns
that must be filed in connection with Transfer Taxes shall be prepared and filed
when due by Resources, and Resources will use its reasonable efforts to provide
such Tax Returns to Seller at least 10 days prior to the Due Date for such Tax
Returns.



     10.4 Indemnification.


          (a) Seller's Indemnification of Resources. Seller shall indemnify
     Resources from, against and in respect of (A) any Taxes imposed on Genco or
     any Subsidiary of Genco with respect to any taxable period, or portion
     thereof, ending on or before the Option Closing Date; and (B) any Transfer
     Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof.


                                       25
   29

          (b) Resource's Indemnification of Seller. Resources shall indemnify
     Seller from, against and in respect of any liability of Seller or its
     Subsidiaries for (A) any Taxes imposed on Genco or any Subsidiary of Genco
     with respect to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning on or
     after the Option Closing Date; and (B) any Transfer Taxes for which
     Resources is liable pursuant to Section 10.3 hereof.

     10.5 Computation of Tax Liabilities.


          (a) Proration of Taxes and Earnings and Profits. To the extent
     permitted by law or administrative practice, the taxable years of Genco and
     its Subsidiaries shall end on and include the Option Closing Date. Whenever
     it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes, or the earnings and
     profits, of Genco or any Subsidiary of Genco for a portion of a taxable
     year or period that begins before and ends after the Option Closing Date,
     the determination of the Taxes or the earnings and profits for the portion
     of the year or period ending on, and the portion of the year or period
     beginning after, the Option Closing Date shall be determined by assuming
     that the taxable year or period ended on and included the Option Closing
     Date, except that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated
     on an annual basis and annual property taxes shall be prorated on the basis
     of the number of days in the annual period elapsed through the Option
     Closing Date as compared to the number of days in the annual period
     elapsing after the Option Closing Date.

          (b) Standalone Basis. Whenever it is necessary to determine the
     liability of Genco or any Subsidiary of Genco for Taxes, such liability
     shall be computed as if Genco or such Subsidiary of Genco was not a member
     of Seller's consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group for Tax
     purposes.

     10.6 Contest Provisions.


          (a) Notification of Contests. Each of Resources, on the one hand, and
     Seller, on the other hand (the "Recipient"), shall notify the Vice
     President - Taxes or chief tax officer of the other party in writing within
     45 days of receipt by the Recipient of written notice of any pending or
     threatened audits, adjustments or assessments (a "Tax Audit") which are
     likely to affect the liability for Taxes of such other party. If the
     Recipient fails to give such prompt notice to the other party, it shall not
     be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with
     such Tax Audit if and to the extent that such other party is actually
     prejudiced by such failure to give notice.

          (b) Which Party Controls.

          (1) Seller's Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period,
     or portion thereof, ending on or before the Option Closing Date or for any
     Taxes for which Seller is liable in full hereunder, Seller shall at its
     expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit.


                                       26
   30

          (2) Resource's Items. If such Tax Audit relates to any taxable period,
     or portion thereof, beginning on or after the Option Closing Date or for
     any Taxes for which Resources is liable in full hereunder, Resources shall
     at its expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit.

          (3) Combined and Mixed Items. If such Tax Audit relates to Taxes for
     which both Seller and Resources are liable hereunder, to the extent
     practicable such Tax Items (as defined in Section 10.12 of this Agreement)
     will be distinguished and each party will control the defense and
     settlement of those Taxes for which it is so liable. If such Tax Audit
     relates to a taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning before and
     ending after the Option Closing Date and any Tax Item cannot be identified
     as being a liability of only one party or cannot be separated from a Tax
     Item for which the other party is liable, the party which has the greater
     potential liability for those Tax Items that cannot be so attributed or
     separated (or both) shall control the defense of the Tax Audit, provided
     that such party defends the items as reported on the relevant Tax Return
     and provided further that no such matter shall be settled without the
     written consent of both parties, not to be unreasonably withheld.

          (4) Participation Rights. Any party whose liability for Taxes may be
     affected by a Tax Audit shall be entitled to participate at its expense in
     such defense and to employ counsel of its choice at its expense.

     10.7 Resource's Claiming, Receiving or Using of Refunds and Overpayments.
If after the Closing, Resources, Genco, or any Subsidiary of Genco (A) receives
any refund or (B) utilizes the benefit of any overpayment of Taxes which, in
each case (A) and (B), (x) relates to Taxes paid by Seller or Genco, or any
Subsidiary of Genco with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, ending
on or before the Option Closing Date, or (y) is the subject of indemnification
by Seller pursuant to this Agreement, Resources shall promptly transfer, or
cause to be transferred, to Seller the entire amount of the refund or
overpayment (including interest) resolved or utilized by Resources, Genco, or
any Subsidiary of Genco. Resources agrees to notify Seller within 15 days
following the discovery of a right to claim any such refund or overpayment and
the receipt of any such refund or utilization of any such overpayment. Resources
agrees to claim any such refund or to utilize any such overpayment as soon as
possible and to furnish to Seller all information, records and assistance
necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment.

     10.8 Resolution of All Tax-Related Disputes. In the event that Seller and
Resources cannot agree on the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes or the
interpretation or application of any provision of this Agreement relating to
Taxes, such dispute shall be resolved by a nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually acceptable to Seller and Resources, whose decision shall be final and
binding upon all Persons involved and whose expenses shall be shared equally by
Seller, on the one hand, and Resources on the other hand.

     10.9 Termination of Existing Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing
Tax sharing agreements or arrangements, written or unwritten, binding Genco or
any Subsidiary of Genco, shall be terminated as of the Option Closing Date.


                                       27

     10.10 Assistance and Cooperation. The parties agree that, after the Option
Closing Date:
  

          (a) Resources, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
     each assist the other (and cause its respective Affiliates to assist) the
     other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party is
     responsible for preparing and filing;

          (b) Resources, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
     cooperate fully in preparing for any Tax audits, or disputes with taxing
     authorities, relating to any Tax Returns or Taxes of Genco or any
     Subsidiary of Genco.

          (c) Resources, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
     make available to each other upon written request and to any taxing
     authority as reasonably requested in writing all relevant books and records
     relating to Tax Returns or Taxes of Genco or a Subsidiary of Genco. Any
     such information shall be kept strictly confidential;

          (d) Resources, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall
     promptly furnish the other party with copies of all relevant correspondence
     received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax Audit or
     information request relating to Taxes for which such other party may have
     an indemnification obligation under this Agreement; and

          (e) Except as otherwise provided herein, the party requesting
     assistance or cooperation shall bear the other party's out-of-pocket
     expenses in complying with such request to the extent that those expenses
     are attributable to fees and other costs of unaffiliated third-party
     service providers.

     10.11 This Article X alone shall govern the procedure for all Tax
indemnification claims, notwithstanding any provision of Article XI or of
Article IX of the Master Separation Agreement.

     10.12 For purposes of this Agreement, "Due Date" shall mean, with respect
to any Tax Return, the date such return is due to be filed (taking into account
any valid extensions); and "Tax Item" shall mean, with respect to Taxes, any
item of income, gain deduction, loss or credit or other tax attribute.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                               Dispute Resolution

     11.1 If a dispute, claim or controversy arises out of or in connection with
this Agreement, the parties agree to use the procedures set forth in Article IX
of the Master Separation Agreement, in lieu of either party pursuing other
available remedies, to resolve the same.


                                       28
   32

     11.2 Notwithstanding Section 11.1 or any other provision hereof, it is
understood and agreed that Resources would suffer irreparable harm by reason of
any failure of Regco to perform its obligations under Article III or Section
6.1, and that Resources shall therefore be entitled, in addition to and not in
limitation of all other remedies, to the remedy of specific performance with
respect to any breach or default by Regco of its obligations under Article III
or Section 6.1. This provision shall take precedence over any other dispute
resolution, remedial or other provision of the Master Separation Agreement, this
Agreement, or any other agreement or contract between the parties.

                                  ARTICLE XII
                                  Miscellaneous


     12.1 Modifications to this Agreement Arising from Amendment of the
Utilities Code. To the extent any change effective after the date of this
Agreement to any provision of the Utilities Code (including without limitation
Section 39.262(c) or Section 39.262(h)(3)) accelerates or allows the
acceleration of the filing required by Section 39.262(c) or shortens or
otherwise modifies the 30-trading day period or the 120-trading day period for
the partial stock valuation method in Section 39.262(h)(3) or such other section
that may be used to perform the market valuation of Texas Genco, the dates and
periods set forth in this Agreement shall be adjusted by agreement of the
parties in order to preserve the essential regulatory and other objectives of
the transaction intended by the parties.

     12.2 Amendments. This Agreement shall not be supplemented, amended or
modified in any manner whatsoever (including by course of dealing or of
performance or usage of trade) except in writing signed by the parties.

     12.3 Successors and Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No party shall assign this Agreement or any rights herein
without the prior written consent of the other party, which may be withheld for
any or no reason.

     12.4 Notices. Unless expressly provided herein, all notices, claims,
certificates, requests, demands and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to be duly given (i) when personally delivered or
(ii) if mailed registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt
requested, on the date the return receipt is executed or the letter refused by
the addressee or its agent or (iii) if sent by overnight courier which delivers
only upon the signed receipt of the addressee, on the date the receipt
acknowledgment is executed or refused by the addressee or its agent or (iv) if
sent by facsimile or other generally accepted means of electronic transmission,
on the date confirmation of transmission is received (provided that a copy of
any notice delivered pursuant to this clause (iv) shall also be sent pursuant to
clause (ii) or (iii)), addressed to the attention of the addressee's General
Counsel at the address of its principal executive office or to such other
address or facsimile number for a party as it shall have specified by like
notice.

     12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.


                                       29

     12.6 Headings. The various headings used in this Agreement are for
convenience only and are not to be used in interpreting the text of the Articles
or Sections in which they appear or to which they relate.

     12.7 Severability. Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement
shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law. If any portion of this Agreement is declared invalid for any
reason, such declaration shall have no effect upon the remaining portions of
this Agreement, which shall continue in full force and effect as if this
Agreement had been executed with the invalid portions thereof deleted.

     12.8 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall
constitute one and the same instrument. 12.9 Rights of the Parties. Nothing
expressed or implied in this Agreement is intended or will be construed to
confer upon or give any person or entity, other than the Parties and their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, as the case may be, any rights or
remedies under or by reason of this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
thereby.

     12.10 Reservation of Rights. The waiver by either party of any of its
rights or remedies afforded hereunder or at law is without prejudice and shall
not operate to waive any other rights or remedies which that party shall have
available to it, nor shall such waiver operate to waive the party's rights to
any remedies due to a future breach, whether of a similar or different nature.
The failure or delay of a party in exercising any rights granted to it hereunder
shall not constitute a waiver of any such right and that party may exercise that
right at any time. Any single or partial exercise of any particular right by a
party shall exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right.

     12.11 Entire Agreement. All understandings, representations, warranties and
agreements, if any, heretofore existing between the parties regarding the
subject matter hereof are merged into this Agreement, which fully and completely
express the agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
