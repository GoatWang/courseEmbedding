Integrity Trust CompanyFormed in 1887, Integrity Trust was one of
                the largest banks in Philadelphia until its demise in 1940.
                In 1929 and 1930 it underwent a
                series of mergers, first with West Philadelphia
                  Title and Trust Company in January 1929,
                then with Columbia Avenue Trust Company in May of that
                  year, and Market Street Title
                  and Trust Company in January 1930. Integrity
                Trust turned down an ill-fated opportunity to merge with Bank of Philadelphia and
                  Trust Company; Bankers Trust
                  Company eventually did, marking the beginning of its financial woes.
                Integrity Trust reported gains in 1930, but by October 1931 it began to experience heavy withdrawals. On
                  October 13th, seven of the strongest banks in
                Philadelphia formed a credit pool of $50 million for Integrity Trust so that it
                could continue operating and meet its deposits. This enabled the bank to keep its
                doors open for the time being. 
In January 1938, scandal engulfed Integrity Trust
                regarding its connections to Pennroad Corporation, a holding company with ties to
                the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Examiners with a U.S. Senate committee
                investigating Pennroad found that the company had provided for "window dressing" for
                Integrity Trust's financial reports in 1929, making it
                appear that the trust company had more capital than it did. 
The trust company survived that scandal, but late in 1939
                depositors began another rush of withdrawals. Integrity Trust dissolved in January 1940. By March 1947, the
                FDIC repaid the loans the Philadelphia Clearing
                  House had forwarded to depositors when the bank began experiencing
                troubles, and no depositor in Integrity took any amount of loss.

About

 



At The Trust Company, our only allegiance is to you. We are independent and fee-only, which means we're not in the business of selling products. Instead, we choose from many investment strategies to help you meet your goals. Whether you’d like some guidance with financial planning, would like to learn more about setting up retirement plans for your employees, or need help with foundation or endowment management for your nonprofit, we will provide unbiased expertise.
We actively manage your money and make decisions locally, not at a distant corporate headquarters. We manage your investments individually, and we adjust your portfolio based on changing conditions. There is no “set it and forget it” with The Trust Company.
Your asset security is safeguarded in many ways. The Trust Company is regulated by the Office of the State Bank Commissioner of Kansas, and we use independent, third-party custodians as depositories for all investment securities. And those securities are protected by a $10 million blanket surety bond for each occurrence resulting in a claim, and a $4 million trust errors and omissions insurance policy.*
Explore our services, learn more about our team, and then call or email us today to talk about how we can be of service to you.

Our objective is not just to sell a particular product, nor to accommodate a one-time lighting project, but to build a long term relationship between all concerned parties, including: manufacturers, distributors, installers, designers, and end users.  We work to develop partnerships that are built on integrity, trust, and superior customer service.
In addition to being a manufacturers’ sales representative, Integrity Sales, LLC provides energy consumption audits of existing lighting systems, lighting designs for retrofit applications, as well as consulting on lighting and control system projects.  We specialize in commercial, industrial and outdoor/external lighting systems.
We use up-to-date computer aided programs to do our lighting layout design, including 3-D modeling and point-by-point modeling layouts.  We look for ways to make systems more efficient, more “green”, and more cost effective.  We pay close attention to detail, even taking into consideration the specific geographic location of the system in our modelling in order to account for daylight hours between sunrise and sunset, thus allowing for the dimming of lights, daylight harvesting, and control adjustments to the appropriate light level.
The owner of Integrity Sales, LLC has over 30 years of experience as a manufacturers’ representative and has garnered numerous industry awards over the years.  He has attended countless factory training sessions in order to completely understand the features and benefits of the products for proper selections of fixtures for the appropriate applications.  The experience, familiarity, and knowledge of our product line allow Integrity Sales, LLC to select the appropriate product that will provide the best solution to your lighting needs.
If you are looking to optimize and get the most out of your lighting system through improvements, efficiencies, and up-to-date equipment & controls systems, call Integrity Sales, LLC to see how we can help you with your lighting needs.
