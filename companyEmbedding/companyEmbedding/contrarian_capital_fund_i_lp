Experts in distressed securities
Established in 1995 by Jon Bauer, Janice Stanton and Gil Tenzer, Contrarian is a distressed investing specialist with one of the most stable portfolio management teams in the industry. Jon & Janice have been managing portfolios of distressed securities together since 1986 (joined by Gil in 1993) when they ran the Distressed Debt & Trade Claims businesses for Oppenheimer & Co. We believe this continuity of senior management provides Contrarian with a competitive edge in sourcing and analyzing investment opportunities, as well as navigating the portfolio through multiple business cycles.
Contrarian is 100% partner owned and has a team of highly experienced professionals, many of whom are involved with the portfolio management, research, sourcing and trading of our investments.
Our global headquarters is in Greenwich (CT), with regional investment research offices in London (England), Paris (France), São Paulo (Brazil), and Hong Kong (China SAR).
Contrarian has been registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since 1995* and is also a Qualified Professional Asset Manager with respect to certain of its accounts.

*Registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission does not imply approval or endorsement.

The Flagship Strategy
For more than 30 years the Contrarian team has been focused on identifying the best risk/reward opportunities in distressed assets in the U.S., Western Europe and Emerging Markets. Contrarian’s flagship strategy seeks to capitalize on all manners of distressed investing with particular emphasis on privately traded and complex distressed claims.
A global portfolio seeking equity like returns with the protection rights of a debt holder. Seeks to capitalize on all phases of the distressed cycle. Investments may include distressed U.S. performing debt, European performing debt, emerging markets, bankruptcy/trade claims, post-reorganized equity and opportunistic shorts.
The Contrarian team focuses on capital protection by conducting thorough fundamental analysis, applying conservative valuation metrics, diversifying the flagship portfolio among the most compelling global distressed opportunities and strict avoidance of leverage. The flagship strategy actively invests in “off the run” opportunities that have strong asset coverage, barriers to entry, and trade at significant discounts to similar publicly traded instruments.

our history
Contrarian was established in 1995 by Jon Bauer, Janice Stanton and Gil Tenzer as a specialist in distressed investing. Jon Bauer, who began his focus on investing in distressed opportunities at Bear Stearns in 1981, founded the Distressed Debt & Trade Claims businesses at Oppenheimer & Co. (“OPCO”)  in 1986. He and Janice Stanton, Jon’s first senior hire, began managing portfolios of distressed assets together at OPCO in 1986, marking the inception of what is now Contrarian’s flagship strategy. They were joined at OPCO by Gil Tenzer in 1993.
Today, the multi-billion dollar firm manages predominately institutional client assets, employing professionals across offices in Greenwich, Connecticut (global headquarters), Paris, London, São Paulo, and Hong Kong. While the firm has broadened the team and capabilities over time, Contrarian has consistently managed clients’ portfolios with a singular focus on distressed investing. With more than 30 years of distressed investing experience, the Contrarian team has particular expertise investing in private securities and complex claims, and maintains a keen focus on capital preservation.
