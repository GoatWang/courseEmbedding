Breaking            
Amazon stock touches $1,000 for the first time ever 
Shares of Amazon Inc. on Tuesday hit an intraday record, exceeding $1,000 a share for the first time ever and joining a unique club of companies whose stock carries a four-digit price tag. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20, just near the open of Tuesday trade. Amazon's shares are up about 33% so far in 2017, according to FactSet data. The technology behemoth run by Jeff Bezos, which boasts a market value of roughly $480 billion, joins a rare $1,000-a-share club, which includes names like Berkshire Hathaway , Priceline Group Inc.  and homebuilder NVR Inc. . Moves in Amazon's stock came as the Nasdaq Composite Index  was tilting higher in early trade, on track for a record. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500 index  were trading near break-even levels, but have broadly been in an uptrend, following Friday's record close for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

Breaking            
Amazon stock touches $1,000 for the first time ever 
Shares of Amazon Inc. on Tuesday hit an intraday record, exceeding $1,000 a share for the first time ever and joining a unique club of companies whose stock carries a four-digit price tag. Amazon shares hit $1,001.20, just near the open of Tuesday trade. Amazon's shares are up about 33% so far in 2017, according to FactSet data. The technology behemoth run by Jeff Bezos, which boasts a market value of roughly $480 billion, joins a rare $1,000-a-share club, which includes names like Berkshire Hathaway , Priceline Group Inc.  and homebuilder NVR Inc. . Moves in Amazon's stock came as the Nasdaq Composite Index  was tilting higher in early trade, on track for a record. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  and the S&P 500 index  were trading near break-even levels, but have broadly been in an uptrend, following Friday's record close for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. U.S. markets were closed on Monday in observance of Memorial Day.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

We're much more than hard hats and hammers.

There's a lot more to the homebuilding industry than building homes.

Training /Training doesn't happen only in the classroom.




Training doesn't happen only in the classroom.

To learn our business inside and out, you have to spend some time "outside." That’s why, as an employee, you’ll periodically be out in the field with our regional trainers, learning first-hand how we build our homes, source our materials, work with suppliers, interact with our customers, and more. In addition to our interactive, hands-on training, we pair you with mentors who are eager to share their knowledge, provide guidance and help you be successful.

We offer all our employees stock ownership through a profit sharing trust as part of our retirement savings package. As we grow financially, so do you.














Financial Stability /$5.7 Billion annual revenue in 2016.




We've built a strong house.

Wall Street analysts consistently rank NVR as one of the most financially stable publicly held companies in the U.S. We’re also one of the most profitable homebuilders in the country-and the only publicly held homebuilder to remain profitable during the recent economic downturn.







Large, Established Homebuilder /Over 417,000&nbsp;new homes sold since 1948.




In our case, big means better.

NVR is a Top 5 U.S. Homebuilder and a leading Fortune 500 company. We've sold over 417,000 new homes since we began in 1948. The quality we've built into all those homes is a pretty big deal, too. It's earned us respect in the industry and the respect of our customers, as well. In fact, 96% of the people who buy our homes say they'd recommend us to family and friends.

High degree of responsibility, even in early employment

Debt to capital ratio

Experienced Management Team /Our experience counts.

And the average tenure of our top 200 managers is 15 years. But it’s not just their longevity that’s impressive—it’s their quality.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
