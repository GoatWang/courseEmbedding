HIRING A DOCUMENT EXAMINER/HANDWRITING EXPERT-ATTORNEY- EXPERT RELATIONSHIP

Posted on February 23, 2012 by admin 

You have finally made a decision to hire a document examiner/handwriting expert. Hopefully, it is not a week before the trial, though I do understand, perhaps better than most that true emergencies can come up, like when my client and friend a former DA in Philadelphia, calls at 11PM on a Sunday night for a trial the next morning when a petition suddenly shows up that must be challenged.
When your office is at home, and attorneys get to know that, you learn to expect those things, but you have to be a pretty close friend to even think about getting away with calling me at 11pm on a Sunday night.  Otherwise, I will just tell you to take a tranquilizer and call me in the morning and I won’t even send you a bill for the advice.
 Well now as Steve Allen used to say: “All seriousness aside, let’s talk”
Generally speaking, experts do NOT like being called at the last minute. For me, last minute is anything less than two weeks prior to the time an opinion, albeit even a preliminary, is needed. Don’t even think about it if its a trial less than two weeks before the date of trial. This does NOT send a good message to your potential expert and will likely have him running in the other direction.
The reasons should be quite obvious. As I have tried to convey in my previous post, authenticating a signature or handwritten document can be quite complex depending on the case, Although I can appreciate the fact that an attorney, who on average, research shows, only uses a document examiner once every fifteen years,   may not fully understand exactly what is needed to render an opinion that can be defended in court and, in fact, may have a simplified view of what is required.  Attorneys need to give the expert sufficient time to collect said information that the scientific authority and case law require-otherwise, the whole exercise is a collosal waste of time and money and what’s the point? Nothing is solved and both the attorney and expert risk looking very bad to the judge for not being properly prepared and the judge may harbor an unconscious bias, thinking in his or her mind that the reason the attorney waited to the last minute is that he/she wanted to “slip something by”them. Maybe just maybe, the judge won’t have the time to look at things too closely if the attorney”s signature issue is really crap and his last minute ploy is merely a ploy to delay things, hoping it may somehow favor the client’s case by stonewalling. Maybe the plaintiff is right, the client’s  signature really IS a forgery. Why would an attorney want to pay an expert to tell them something they already suspect might be true–at least not pay them a lot of money anyway-hence the recent proliferation of cheap experts willing to say anything for a buck just so that your opposing counsel can cause further delay and expense to your client and who knows maybe even make them throw in the towel and go away. Litigatin IS getting VERY  expensive these days and the truth can sometimes suffer for that. Standing on principle it seems is getting to be a lost art.
 This is why I take great pains to not allow myself to get involved in any of these dubious situations. Like I said, there sometimes ARE true emergencies, but like the sign I saw on a fellow expert’s desk says: “Poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part”. I will take an emergency for someone I know or have worked for before, but let’s face it, it is NOT a good sign for an expert when he or she gets those last minute frantic phone calls. It usually indicates to me that the attorney doesn’t want to pay unless they absolutely have to and even then, not pay too much or on the alternative are not well prepared. To an expert, either scenario is not good. It is hard to immagine someone being so poorly prepared that they didn’t know they had a trial in a week But hey, what do I now do with the cases I am working on for attorneys who did NOT wait until the last minute?  Is it fair to them?
So the bottom line is that generally experts should avoid what my wife calls “Last Minute Louies” unless of course you like headaches and stress and chasing after lawyers for money-good luck on that.
So now back to “working with your document examin/handwriting expert” FINALLY.
Again, it is not my purpose to train anyone in document examination but instead what to do to get the most out of the attorney/expert relationship. Nor is it my job to quote the pertinent laws that relate to questioned documents in general and to this case in particular. It is a partnership, but not an equal partnership. At all  times, it must be remembered, the attorney is the manager of his or her case and the expert must comply, as long as it does not violate any legal or ethical tenet whether it be the experts Code of Ethics or the attorney’s, notwithstanding “last minute Louie” The attorney should also have SOME rudimentary knowledge of the field such as one might find in my soon to be published book to give them SOME parameters of what the expert might need.
 The expert must rely on counsel’s advice about the relavent law pertaining to the case and must comply. Likewise the attorney must comply with the scientific principles of the field that the expert must rely on and will be impeached for if not compliant.
In one sense, it is really quite simple for the expert. If the scientific authority says you do X then you do X. and you request that counsel do everything in his or her power to assist you  comply with the scientific authorites and not try to manipulate things to save time or money. For example, the issue of exemplars often comes up Ie the known samples the expert must rely on to determine the writing habbits of the person who signature or writing is in dispute  DURING THE   TIME PERIOD of the disputed document. The authorities on this subject are quite clear as to what is reqired-how many, when, what type, etc. Ignorance or laziness to obtain proper samples on the part of counsel when the expert can not obtain them on their own(such as when a subpoena is required) is no excuse. The information is there in publics records, if necessary, which, thanks to the net are now much easier to obtain. Being told: “This is all I have” will only get you a preliminary opinion from me which will be useless in court. This is also true for any other information that may impact the analysis which your expert will be glad to provide in numbing detail. If the authority and thus the expert require it, it MUST be obtained. Experts who do not insist that their client/counsel provide the required material or information set themselves up for possible impeachment and even malpractice, an ever increasing tort in litigation now.  And they only have themselves to blame. If counsel does not or can not comply with proper scientific authority, the answer is simple and clear-NO FINAL REPORT WILL BE ISSUED BY THE EXPERT -PERIOD!!!! I provide a detailed list of what is required and it must be signed and returned with the required information. In my cases, it is not possible to proceed unless all the required information is provided, but it seems there are some experts and attorneys who are willing to play “Russion Roulette” as one attorney/client told me, by not doing what is required for the sake of experdiency and hoping things work out OK.
As experts, we are not in the business of taking short cuts to please counsel and thus put ourselves at risk. And counsel should not be in the business of taking short cuts lest they lose the case and incurr the rath of a client or possibly worse. It used to be that it was hard to find a lawyer who would sue another lawyer-not anymore. The relationship between the expert and his or her client/attorney should be one of mutual respect and cooporation to reach a common goal–justice for the client. It will not work otherwise.  The expert must allow counsel to do his job and not interfere and counsel must allow his expert to do his job and not impede. The right thing must ALWAYS be done to insure the best result. And let’s not forget, you don’t want to antagonize your expert by not paying their bill or resisting their advice or you will quickly lose them then have to start all over with another expert-if you can find one willing to take over.
Let’s face it, I, as an experienced and knowledgable expert do not want to be associated with experts who do not share my standards. Of course, we are not talking about students and trainees here. We are talking about experienced experts who KNOW or are supposed to know what their job is and how to do it. It often amazes me how highly little highly credentialed experts know about their field. I once had a case where an experienced government expert answered “I don’t know” twelve times in a row to basic skill questions about handwriting, prompting the judge to turn and ask: “Well, sir, just what do you know?”  There went any credability he had, highly credentialed or not. And please as an expert, DO NOT advocate for your attorney or client or there goes your credibility. You can defend your opinion when it comes under attack, as it most certainly will on cross, as Albert Osborn, one of the accepted authorities in the field says you must. But there is a BIG difference between advocating for you attorney/client and defending what you believe to be the correct conclusion.
Lawyers are no different than experts.. A good and honest lawyer does not want to be associated with anyone whose standards are less than his or hers. That not only includes integrity, but work ethic as well. What would be the point? If you win a case dishonestly, what have you won except “bad karma” as they say? You have to look yourself in the mirror. You have to look in the eyes of your kids and tell them to be honest and hard working if they are to acheive in life. There is NO exception here. We all KNOW that, so why argue the point. Why shade the truth thinking no one will know. YOU  will know. God will know. There will ALWAYS be a pay back for anyone who does not to follow what their heart tells them IS the right thing to do even if the pay back is feeling guilty and ashamed, which has been shown to have a bad effect on your health. As one young lawyer once told me: “I try not to piss off highly qualified and experienced experts. You never know when you might need them again”. By the same token, the attorney must always remember that it is really the client who has the ultimate say and who must be pleased with the effort in the end by both the attorney and the expert.  Clients should not be left in the dark about anything and should be informed each step of the way.
Like President Truman said when the politicians were telling him what they thought he should do as he pounded his fist on the table: “DAMN IT,  WHY DON’T WE JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH!!!”  That did not win him many friends in Washington, but he covered that to: “If you want a friend in Washington”, he said, “get a dog.
I have one, my Golden Retriever Gracie(who is on YouTube by the way)
A truer friend you would never want. She never complains as long as the biscuits are nearby and finds the greatest joy in the simplest things in life, like a walk in the park. There is a powerful lesson there somewhere.

WAR AND KARMIC DEBDT

Posted on July 25, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

I went to the Phillies game last night with a dear friend of 13 years and her husband. When I first met Eileen, there was an overwhelming attraction which I could not understand.I fell deeply in love with her. Being married already, I KNEW that nothing could come of this intense attraction and I felt but I had to understand why I felt the way I did with this beautiful, kind and spiritual stranger at the time. It just so happened at that time that I was saying a Novena to St. Theres, “The Little Flower. I was having a hard time emotionally and needed a friend. When you say a Novena to St. Theres, you are supposed to see a rose or roses. So that day when  Eileen and I were parting, she handed me her photography card. It was a rose. I told her: “You are an answer to a prayer and she has been all of these years.
Just around that time, I happened to see a show on TV about reincarnation. Accident? I have come to learn over the years that there are NO accidents on this earth. God is in charge.
But before I go on, I want to say a word about reincarnation. A man I met at the Haddonfield Post Office, by chance(there we go again) is an expert in esoteric forms of yoga and we formed a bod as I was taking yoga classes almost every day on that topic as well as other forms of Yoga. Mahir was his name and he explained that Hindus and Budists believe in reincarnation. In fact, there are TWO BILLION people who live on this planet who do. Catholics generally do not, but cave writings found in 1945 dated to 100 AD profess to claim that Jesus Christ spoke of it. As the story goes the writings were destroyed and members of the sect were burned at the stake.
Well, Mahir explained that if you are living on this earth, by nature you are imperfect(as all religions do) and when you die, you will die as an imperfect being, so by nature, this means that you will return in another body on your quest for perfection. You have no choice. It WILL happen. He explained that it may take millions of incarnations over millions of years to reach perfection which is up to us and since there is no such thing as time in the spirit world it may take eons of time to reach that state.
This brings me back to Eileen. So, as I was saying, around the time I met her, there was an instant bond I could not explain. I also, at that time, had a strong emotional reaction to anything involving the Civil War(which was anything but civil, btw)I also came across a book by a Dr. Newton called “The Journey of Souls”, all about reincarnation. He was a therapist who used hypnosis in his work and one day with one of his patients under hypnosis, the patient spontaneously went back into a past life that was greatly impacting the problem for which he was having therapy in this life. Dr. Newton reasoned that if a patient can go back to a past life by accident in a therapy session, he thought that maybe he can do this on purpose. He could. And over 30 years, he regressed HUNDREDS of patients and to his amazement found they all shared a “journey”, hence the title of his book
So after I read this book, another coincidence? happened. I saw a TV show about a Dr. Bowman, who was a specialist in past life regression and lo and behold, she was in the Media, Pennsylvania area, not far from me, So I made an appointment. So this amazing confluence of cynchronic events under hypnosis lead to the explanation as to why I was so overcome by the Civil War and so in love with someone I barely knew
It was in that session I learned of my extreme bond to Eileen and my extreme sadness about the Civil War. I remember when my wife and I visited a friend who taught at Sheppard college in Sharpsburg Pennsylvanie which was near the Civil War battlefield of Antietem. I often ask people the trivia question: “What day in September did thousands of American die?” They always say 9/11, 2001. NOOO. It was the battle of Antietem where 25,000(if you can only imagine) were killed or wounded IN JUST ONE DAY!!!. My wife and I visited the battlefield. I knelt by the grave markers and cried and sobbed uncontrollably.
So as it came out in the session, I was killed in battle during the Civil War as a confederate soldier and the interesting part was that I was knocked off my horse and the Union  clubbed me over the head with his rifle butt and held me under water, filing my skull with water.
As Dr. Bowman was imploring me to allow my spirit to “go to the light”, something kept pulling me back so she said: “Let’s see who this is that is pulling you back”. IT WAS EILEEN, CRYING  PRAYING FOR ME(It is often said by spiritualists that if you pray for the dying, it holds them to this earth when they really need to “go to the light”) I could see the clearest image of Eileen and that of a four year old little girl who looked just like her holding up her arms  for “daddy”
So as the hypnosis session ended, Dr. Bowman asked: “What did you bring from this past life to the present?” As I looked at my body in the water and  head split open full of water, I said spontaneously: “A head full of water”(the title of my book) an obvious reference to the SEVERE hydrocephalus I lived with whom Dr. Grady, a top brain surgeon once remarked about: “I have only seen five patients with hydrocephlus as severe as yours and they were ALL profoundly retarded–all the rest were dead. Yet you have an IQ of 133.” He pointed to the third ventricle of my brain which had a hole in it and explained that hydrocephalis infants today get a procedure called an ETV(Endoscopic third ventricular ostomey, where a hole is made in the third ventricle to relieve the pressure on the brain. That didn’t exist in my time so the question remains: “How did the hole get there” My mother claimed it was because her father,a devoutly religious and brilliant man who got his Masters Degree from St. Joe”s College when he was just 16 said a Novena to the Blessed Virgin and the condition suddenly arrested itself(the brain created a hole EXACTLY where a surgeon would have put it, but I was never operated on since there were no scars. To this day, I keep a lighted statue of the Blessed Virgin(which belonged to a dear aunt who died of cancer when I was 17) on my night table at night and can’t sleep without looking at and praying to  her.
So here I was, killed in battle leaving a wife and small child to fend for themselves. A scenario  repeated thousands of time after young men with a wife and child are killed n battle over the years. “Oh when will they ever learn” as the song goes.
Another concept of reincarnation is that when you die, is if you have unfinished business such as I just alluded to with someone you leave behind, your soul will search and search for the spirit of that person to satisfy the karmic debt.
Such was the case with Eileen until that fateful day in September of 2003 when I met her walking around Audubon lake takeing pictures of the swans and ducks. I was walking my beloved Golden Retriever Gracie who proceeded to scatter all the ducks and geese when Gracie saw her and wanted to say “Hello”. As she told the story: “I wondered who this rude man was who couldn’t control his dog, but out of Christian, love, she decided to forgive me and I am glad she did.
So finally, this brings up the point of this blog. How many times is the scenario of Eileen and I and my death during the Civil War leaving her with a small child to raise. Over all recorded time, it must be hundreds o f thousands, if not millions of times. They say that when you die leaving a wife and small children, in another life, your soul MUST find that sould to make sure they are not abandoned AGAIN. My soul found Eileen and I am happy to say, she has found someone who loves and takes good care of her. I met him at the Phillies game last night and thanked him and told him how grateful I am he is taking care of a dear friend I have know for thirteen years.
So what is the answer to all this. Perhaps it can be found in the final verse of “The Minstrel Boy” a Civil War ballad Which begins:
“The Minstrel boy to the war has gone, in the ranks of death you will find him.
His father’s sword he hath girded on, his wild harp slung behind him….”.
The last verse reads:
“The minstrel boy will return one day, when we hear the news  we will cheer it.
the Minstrel Boy will return torn we pray torn  in body but not in spirit
To live in a world such as Heaven intended
And all the bitterness of man must cease and every battle must be ended”

LAWYERS WHO ALLOW CLIENTS TO CONTACT AND COMMUNICATE DIRECTLY WITH EXPERTS IN POTENTIAL LITIGATION ARE PUTTING THEIR CASE IN JEOPARDY

Posted on June 12, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

Expert reports and testimony only have value if they are: Honest, detailed, relavent and comply with prevailing case law and accepted scientific authority. Experts who meet these criteria seldom disagree in the matter in question with the opposing expert-perhaps 1% of the time.
It then comes down to the expert’s ability to convey those findings in a detailed, thorough and objective manner that does not contradict itself or ANY prior testimony on a similar case.
Unfortunately that is seldom the case.
Since 95% of all cases settle many lawyers reason why bother to hire a highly qualified experienced  and expensive expert  for most cases, especially if the other side doesn’t have one since as is the case with my work, signatures and writing can be proven can be “proven” with the testimony of someone who is familiar with the writing of the person whose signature is disputed as long as the opinion is not biased for any reason and is honest. Credibility of the witness goes to the weight given to it.
But herein lies the issue of the client contacting the expert and NOT the attorney. In signature cases, the client is seldom objective and may say or do something to try to influence the expert’s opinion. Honest experts DO NOT put themselves in that position even though they may be totally honest. You simply can’t stop a jury from believing otherwise because of the public perception that experts ALWAYS  disagree, which is certainly NOT the case. Dishonest experts disagree not honest ones, but lacking the experience of most  judges who have seen it all, laymen can’t always tell who is honest and who is not. There are MANY experts who make a very nice living slanting the truth to take advantage of the ignorance of a jury or even a judge. Experts are experts becasuse they do in fact know more than the judge and jury, which is why it is imperative to show in court that the expert IS in fact following the prevailing science and case law and has done so in ALL of his.her prior cases. This is exactly why the attorney MUST take command in ANY case where an expert is involved.
But today, not only are attorneys NOT hiring experts when they should, but they are abandoning their responsibility by letting the client do it, given what I said above. They are playing Russian Roulette with the case to simply save a few dollars in a case that will settle anyway. They simply don’t understand that the value of a good expert will win them substantially more than the fees that expert might charge. So not only are they CHEAP but LLAZY too. So they make it up on volume. The name of the game for some lawyers(many?) is minimal effort and expense/maximum gain–and certainly NOT justice for their client who is in the dark about a lot of these things and will not liely succeed in a malpractice suit even if they were unless the violation is egregious. Unfortunately being cheap and lazy are not unethical.
What is more egregious is the thousands of legitimate cases that go unprosecuted because the lawyers deems they simply just won’t make enough money to justify the effort. Many lawyers think the matter is a loss if they don’t recover MORE than what their hourly rate is for the time they spent  as if they are entitled to a dividend for doing what they should be doing anyway–their job.
I can’t even begn to count the number of cases where I earned hourly fees that FAR exceed the actually hours I spent on the case, but I still made money which as one old lawyer friend told me: “its better than a shap stick n the eye” but MOST importantly, I help the client  get SOMETHING. I am reminded of the litigant who complained to the judge about not getting justice in hiis case and Oliver Wendall Holmes stated: “Sir, this is a court of law, NOT a court of justice.
This is EXACTLY what you can expect if the attorney allows the client to have ANY contact with the expert outside of their presence and without their knowledge and consent. The attorney is the manager of the case and MUST know everything that is going on and will only have themselves  to blame if they lose. How do you stop a jury from believing the testimony was NOT tainted? You don’t

ARE THE VOICES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS MORE VALUABLE THAN YOURS?

Posted on June 8, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

There are a lot of VERY smart in this country who know a LOT about a LOT of things or are experts in different subjects whose knowledge in those subjects are far superior even to so called top experts, yet never get the chance to tell anybody, perhaps because they don’t try or  no one will listen or they just don’t get the chance.
Sadly, the media will only give voice to those who can raise their ratings and many experts are just too introverted or just don’t get the opportunity to share what they know.
The end result is that important knowledge that could help many or even save lives is often suppressed by those in control.
A glaring example of this is Dr. Emanuel Rivici, now deceased who received a patton on over 100 miracle drugs such as Purse, a drug that stops a heroin addiction in three days. Today 1000 people die every day from heroin over doses as great cost to the tax payers. And there are numerous similar examples.
But all is not lost. We have more power than we realize. I once called my Congressman EVERY day for 2 1/2 years to address an issue and we ALL  have that power if we only to exercise it.
A simple five minute phone call a day-EVERY DAY can not be ignored forever.
If Congress were to suddenly get one milion phone calls from around the county, they would HAVE to listen to us.
So what are YOU waiting for

BEING A SUCCESS IN BUSINESS AND IN LIFE-WHAT TO DO AND NOT DO

Posted on June 5, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

Despite how the world has change so profoundly in the last few years, much less since the Industrial Revolution, the formula for success hasn’t really change so much. What HAS changed is that few businesses  and people follow the formulas for success that have been established for hundreds of years, namely uncompromising integrity and very hard work.
But most companies and people create their own obstacles to success because success comes with responsibility and many have fear of failure in being able to meet those responsibilities which often causes us to settle for less than what we KNOW  what we can do since risking failure is too hard to bear. We don’t have the confidence to really push ourselves. We do what we feel comfortable doing, not what we KNOW we should be doing, but putting aside that fear and uncertainty with techniques such as meditation allows us to relax and it is a proven fact, our most creative moments come when we are relaxed and happy. If there are more serious stresses n our lives holding us back such as illness, marital problems etc., they MUST  be dealt with by whatever means necessary including medical intervention. But putting this aside, there are many areas of our life that need attention such as family, church, recreation. Workaholics really are not successful people. Working more is not the answer. The physical, mental and emotional fatigue they cause throws our whole life out of balance. There is a fine line between working hard and being obsessed. Fear is NEVER the answer to success.
When we pressure ouselves and become fatigued is when we begin to cut corners. Who is going to know? On the surface to those on the outside people may not be aware at first, but WE will know and cutting corners WILL eventually reveal itself.
A dear, now deceased, friend of mine in reviewing the MBA programs of today as opposed to the past made an interesting observation. Many programs today have triedd to reduce business to an exact science about what to do and when. But he observed, many of these programs lack one thing, courses in ethics. It seems today that the ends justifies the means as long as the law is not broken(and sometimes it is). The focus is on the bottom line. But there are ethical and moral rules, though not illegal if not followed create serious repercussions if not followed. Customers WILL punish you if they feel your cost cutting is going too far at the expense of the product or service. Good will, it seems has been lost. Remember what God said. “Bread cast upon the waters, comes back threefold” Things are not always “strictly business”. Nor should they be. A little bit of “good will” can  go a long way. A drug company making a generous gift of drugs to the poor is NOT good will if they are all expired, which the company gets a nice tax cut for the donation. It seems that whatever business can get away with is OK. They push it to the limit.  They think people are powerless to do anything.

SHAKESPEARE SAID KNOW THYSELF AND PHYSICIAN HEAL THYSELF. TRUE SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND PERFECT HEALTH IS ALL WE REALLY NEED. GOD WILL HELP US WITH THE REST

Posted on May 29, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

Now in today’s era of modern medicine and computers, have things REALLY changed from what they were at the dawn of civilization from the times of the Greeks, Jews, Chinese, Indians and, of course cave men and women Are we REALLY better off, living longer,  healthier, better,  more relaxed and happier lives. One could argue that the average life span 100 years ago wasn’t very high, but that was because infant mortality was very high. By the same token, stress levels were much lower and life was less hectic as long as there was ample food and nature seems to have provided. Animals have survived millions of years without having to go to the “Supermarket” and man did too. Human life is millions of years old if the fossils are to be believed.
So I ask again. Are we better off? Have things REALLY better? Do we REALLY  need all that we have today to be happy and survive. There have been people who have lost millions yet still survived. I read that if you have some loose change laying around the house, you have more money than 2 Billion people who live on the planet. Do the Billionaires REALLY need all that money?
So back to the point of this blog. What is the price for good health, or perhaps more importantly, what price do we pay for bad health and can we control that? How much money do we REALLY need and can we can control that.
Well, I am here to tell you that EVERYBODY can live a life in virtually perfect health in life with all the wealth we need  eating the food God gave the cave men–even growing the food in our back yard or a food co-op for people who don’t have their own yard. As for money, most peoplle are smart enough to study what works in the market and what doesn’t and to start saving 20% of their earning beginning with the first job out of school at age 18. Why don’t they do that? Whose fault is it?
Well, I hate to say this, but the young people of today BETTER do that or they simply  will not survive. Doesn’t it make sense to keep and maintain control over your life from an early age. What does it take to exercise for an hour every day? Or even less. What does it take to save? I am 67 years old and have Never owned a new car. Yet hardly a month goes by that someone knocks on my door and wants to buy my 1980 Malibu or my 78 Caprice that was given to me by my late father-in-law.  I haven’t been on a vacation in 17 years. I have a beautiful yard and enjoy lounging in the sun and playing w/my Golden Retriever. I visit friends who own houses down the shore or in Florida and they are glad to see me.  I buy VERY expensive men’s shoes that last 15 years being re-soled when needed-same for suits-Brooks Brothers than can be altered when needed. Most of he food I eat is organic and naturally grown, much  right in my back yard.
 
The only thing that bothers me about money is all the crooks that earn it dishonestly in vast amount they don’t need, nor do they share it to help people but waste it on things that NO ONE needs, like the $12 Million Rolls Roye someone had made for themselves or the millions spent on lavish jewelry that no one really needs.
It is indeed very sad that most people today  walk around in a fog today functioning on “auto-pilot” when an hour(or less) of daily meditation could make all the difference in the world as well as an hour(or less) of reading the classics or an hour(or less) of daily exercise. When I worked a regular job, during my lunch hour I ate then spent the remaining time walking. On the subway home, I meditated. I got to the point where I completely blocked out the sound of the subway. Unfortunately I did not save and am now paying the consequences, though I DO consider myself fortunate in that I own my home and there is food on the table and nice clothes on my back-things that millions don’t have. But the greatest gift I have is my health having survived cancer and lastly self-knowledge which is a never ending quest. Another gift I have is the ability to help people, the rewards of which can not be measured in the eyes of God. A brief example of this is as follows:  I was walking the dog around the lake and happened to meet a women and we started to talk. I always tell people how I cured my cancer–The Budwig diet. Well as it turned out, this women was just diagnosed with breast caner. Well recently I saw her again and she said to me: “I want to thank you. You saved my life. After I met you, I did the Budwig diet and now I am cancer free” How do you put a price on that? It does not take much effort to be kind.
Part of knowing yourself is discovering the gifts God gave you and using them to make yourself and others happy and prosperous. It would be sad to waste them since God gave them to you and our mission on this life is to help other people.
 
I don’t know who will read this, but you can visit me on Facebook if you do and let me know what you think. You can find me under Robert J. Phillips, Document Examiner, or my name plus Audubon, New Jersey on my private Facebook account

REGRETS OVER THE PAST AND THINGS WE FAILED TO DO-MUST WE FORGET THEM OR STUDY THEM DEEPLY TO LEARN FROM THEM?

Posted on May 27, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

There is an ancient Viking oracle called the  Runes. One of the Runes is “Gateway-The Place of Non-Action. In relevant part it says:…”The gateway is not to be approached without contemplation….Now is not the time to make decisions. Visualize yourself standing on a gateway on a hill top. Your entire life lies out behind you and below. Before you step through, pause and review the past-the learning and the joys,; the victories and the sorrows–everything it took to bring you here. Observe it all, bless it all and release it all.  For in letting go of the past, you reclaim your power”
Does a writer really want to do this, especially his anger over the many injustices he has experienced that need balancing and correcting. Is it up to him or as so may say: “Put in in God’s hands and move on”
I am reminded of a cartoon I saw in the New Yorker. A young college graduate is sitting on the ledge of a tall building writing his parents a suicide note: “Dear Mom and Dad. You have given me a happy life and all that I needed. I will NEVER become a writer”
Isn’t that what writers do–dredge up and live in the past. Why  would anyone want to re-live all their pain and suffering.  Well it has been said that those who do not learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them(find quote).
Well not only do WE have to learn from our own mistakes and not repeat them, but don’t our parents  teachers and others  and in fact history itself give us lessons to help us avoid their mistakes in the future.
So–do we REALLY want to forget the past and move on in our quest to reach the impossible-perfection? Or is it a learning opportunity  for which we should be grateful
 
Well–What do you think?

CONFUCIUS SAY: “Nothing new under the sun”

Posted on May 21, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

Well, I don’t know how he felt about the moon, but at least we know there is nothing new under the Sun.
When I was at Temple in the 60’s and 70’s, as a shy young man in my early twnties, I was overwhelmed at the number of students there and how difficult it was  for me to meet people. I later realized that the people God wants you to meet, he will arrange for that. One such person I met was a Chinese student who uttered those words to me. Often times, I learned more from the myriad of cultures I encountered at Temple than from the professors.
But, In fact a book I read suggests this may be all preordained by choice BEFORE we are born. In his book: “The Journey of Souls” the author Michael Newton goes so far as to say that before you are born into this life, after your last life time, there is a place called: “The place of recollection” where you will meet the souls that will have a significant impact on your life, whether it is a fleeting moment, such as the moment my father raised me up to shake the hand of former President Kennedy when he came to Philadelphia on July 4, 1962, totally unaware of the profound impact he would have on a handwriting case I would be involved with him and the things I would learn about him that few people know even to this day Or the profound impact my wife of almost 30 years would have not to forget my dear friend Eileen whom I met by chance on a picture taking jaunt around Audubon lake one fateful day many years ago that has profoundly  changed my life forever. Newton puts forth compelling proof of this from hundreds of past life regressions, one of which I experienced detailed elsewhere. Only a fool closes their minds to these things. Billions of people around the world hold to these beliefs and compelling scientific evidence exists also found in a book by Ian St4evenson a college professor who wrote a book called “Sixty Cases Suggestive of of Reincarnation”
My point is that you do not have to worry about getting what you need in life, God or the Universe, depending on your belief will provide, if you have faith and don’t allow your free will to muck things up too much. Plan and make goals for the future and focus your efforts each day on moving those plans forward, after you meet the required needs of your life at the moment. But most importantly listen to what God and the universe are telling you and the only way you can do that is through prayer and meditation. Prayer is asking God or the universe what your purpose is and meditation is listening for the answer, though the answer may come in a variety of ways such as these chance encounters I mention.
I firmly beleived that we are here in this life to fulfill a purpose. Generally it is to help people, but specifically it is to utilize the specific skills and knowledge we have gained that adds the piece to the puzzle of God’s or natures overall plan and the reason we have so much turmoil is that so many people are NOT doing what God wants them to do, but instead what THEY think is the right things to do and this is usually motivated greatly by self-interest, NOT the needs of others whom God has sent us here to help.
 
When my phone rings, the way I look at it is that God is sending me that person to help them and if, for whatever reason I can’t, I have to find someone who CAN
But getting back to our old friend Confucious  and “Nothing new under the sun” What ever service we are providing is not something new that someone else has not allready provided to someone else. What IS new about it is, the unique time, place and person to whom the service is provided. It may be just the thing that person needed to hear at that perticular moment that may help them resolve a major problem or issue.
This goes directly to the point of why a writer needs to write. He or she is NOT going to provide information that has not been heard or written about many times before. No one person has the answers to ANYTHING. But for that one brief moment in time when a potential reader is browsing the shelves, they may not realize it, but they are looking for answers to a current problem and God is or the universe is guiding them right to it. Sometimes we are not necessarily looking for an answer at the moment, but it is in our subconscious sending out thoughts at the speed of light and a receptive soul who gets them and rushes to the rescue.
Some years ago, I remember a psychic from Philadelphia, Valery Morrison who had a letter of appreciation on her wall from the CIA thanking her for her help. It seems that she and a number of other famous psychics would meditate in a room toegether and focus on the question at hand about what might be inside the Kremlin in Russia. As was later verified, the information they retrieved in this way proved to be astoundingly accurate.
 
How could this be? Well, when you understand that EVERYTHING is energy with very little sold matter in the universe. It is very easy to understand. Brian Green in his classic book: “The Elegant Universe” demonstrates that Physics has proven that everything that exists in our universe was compressed into a particle that would make a grain of sand look HUGE. And in his subsequent book: “The Fabric of the Cosmos” about string theory he suggests that there may be in infinite number of these particles that come into and go out of existence over the eons of time
So when we as writers write something, it is NOT that it is new and profound to the world, but to the reader who is reading it because God whispered to them thatthis might provied an immediate answer to the problem perplexing them at the  moment
This happens to me all the time when I have a health problem. The answer often mysteriously shows up in a article I am reading or a show I am watching on TV.
So the bottom line is that DO   NOT be discouraged from writing because the information you are conveying may be just the thing someone needs to hear that could even save their life I will close with a case in point I may have mentioned elsewhere. Last year, I was walking my beloved Golden Retriever Gracie around the lake and happened to strike up a conversation with a woman and  since I had cancer was discussing various cancer cures listed on www.CancerTuto.com, one of which is the Budwig Diet. She was a doctor in Hungary in the 1950’s. She had two medical degrees and a Phd is Physics and she made a simple discovery that if you mix 2/3 cup of cottage cheese and six tablespons of flax seed oil together and have this every day, she found there was a 90% chance it would cure their cancer.
So a year later, don’t I see the same woman and she says: “I want to thank you. You saved my life. I am cancer free after doing the Budwig Diet”
So the bottom line is, don’t be discouraged about writing and getting your message out. The person or peoplle who need to hear it WILL, even if you DONT make a million, you could save a life and HOW do you put a price on that?

ALL MEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE HORRORS OF WAR ARE HEROES-THE STORY OF MY DAD ON ANZIO BEACH IN WWII

Posted on May 21, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

“He ran 100 yards as machine gun bullets hit all around him and the 88 fired a couple rounds at him but he dived into a shell hole and the enemy mchachine guns converged their fire on it” A comrade later wrote: (He was a madman now and walked to the 88mm(machine gun) firing his rifle from his hip. He had apparently forgotten the other two machine guns…He reached a point about ten yards from the weapon and wiped out the five man crew with a long burst of fire…The third machine gun opened fire from about 20 years away and its first burst wounded him, making him stagger, but like a wounded lion, he charged the gun at half run…killing the two man crew with a single burst”….It was his last act and he fell, mortally wounded…” In another incident, the fighting was hand to hand and the US Soldier soon realize he was the only American left. He heard the Germans debating his fate and suddenly hear a click of a weapon and started saying his prayers. All of the sudden a rocket came out of nowhere and killed the Germans and left him without a scratch. In fact, it was often the case where shells came out of nowhere killing everyone within 30  yards, friend or foe. I remember my dad saying that the Germans were so close you could hear them talking at night and patrols were send out to assess their positions or even try to capture one of them to try to get strategic information about  troop positions or size. Thes patrols were often sent out late at night or in the early morning hours. I later found out, my dad was on one such patrol and when the sun came up had to play dead on the beach as German soldiers walked among the bodies sticking them with bayonets.
I heard this account, not from my father, but from others he told some time later. I never knew the details of my father’s service to our country until years later.My father was later blown out of his fox hole and sustained   a serious back injury. I still remember the scar in the shape of a crucifix on his back as I removed blackheads from for him as a child but he never told me any details.
What I did see, however, was my father’s heavy drinking and horrible abuse to my mother and complete lack of responsibility causing us to be thrown out of where we were living 8 time by age 14.
Having been estranged from my father, years later, I learned he was dying of cancer, I realized there was only one thing to do, go to the hoospital and thnak him for the gift of life he gave me and forgive him. He died in peace not long after hearing those words

HUMAN SUFFERING AND THE LEGAL PROFESSION-WHO ARE THE VICTIMS OF INJUSTICE-NO ONE LIKES DISHONEST, INCOMPETENT AND GREEDY LAWYERS. THEY HURT US ALL AND THE PROFESSION.

Posted on April 19, 2017 by Bob Phillips 

I have to say, right up front. THIS BLOG IS AN EXERCISE IN FREE SPEECH AND IS MY OPINION ONLY. It is also not meant as a diatribe about the conduct of  specific lawyers. If one is interested in such things, the proceedings of the various disciplinary boards will provide ample fodder to satisfy your interest-and quite interesting readings they are.  After forty years, I have gotten pretty good at figuring out who the honest, competent and hard working ones are and I prefer to deal with them. When it comes to disputed writing cases, it is really quite simple for the lawyer in principle. He simplay has to folow the prevailing case law and the authoritative literature. In practice though it may be quite another story. Getting the required information for the expert to reach a proper conclusion that will withstand rigorous cross examination is quite another matter and many attorneys simply don’t want to put out the time and effort to do so. I don’t work for lazy, cheap lawyersbut I feel very bad for the clients of such lawyers.
Quite frankly, the legal system is truly only available to the wealthy. Oh sure we have the Public Defenders offices and various Community Legal Services and Legal Aid. But those poor lawyers, idealistic they may be, can not possibly adequately handle the 50 cases or more they find on their desks each day when they come into the office and like ANY profession, you don’t learn everything there is to know in school. As well meaning and superior as the education is in many of the top schools(and I am not going to even broach the subject of the many lesser known schools which don’t have the reputation but can be just as superior), it is VERY doubtful the teachers in those schools teach lawyers to do what a lot of them do today in the “real world” such as lawyers on on TV, which I will touch on below and which most members of the public not only find distasteful but downright disgusting and an embarrassment that few seem to be in any hurry to change. What a MAJOR  mistake it was allowing lawyers to advertise, like Pandoras box that can not be closed now. What all this means, however, is that possibly tens of thousands of litigants with valid cases, many of limited tort do not have access to the courtto receive justice because the cost benefit ratio to many lawyers simply does not justify the  time and expense. But if these lawyers on earn $10,000 on the case, it is money they did not have and just imagine the good will created by helping someone.
 
Unfortunately many lawyers today view their jobs as a way to make large amounts  of money–QUICKLY, primarily for themselves.For many, the ideals they entertained when entering law school, vanish when it comes down to making a living. Fortunately, this is not the majority, but such lawyers taint the public’s opinion of the profession in general. The majority of the public view lawyers negatively because of the behavior and greed of the minority If the client gets some  money so much the better but for that minority we are talking about, that is NOT the goal, but let’s make this crystal clear-most  lawyers are NOT in  the profession to ease a client’s suffering that resulted from the cause of action before them because money alone can not solve many of the consequences foisted on the plaintiff by the misdeeds of the defendant and they are not qualified to solve those problems and in many cases nor do they care to, nor do they want to take the time and energy to do so. Unfortunately, today, the attorney does not see it as his job to find physical  mental and emotional treatment for their clients which were the cause of their suffering brought about by the actions of the defendant. It is up to the plaintiff to provide their own treatment AND TO PAY FOR IT!!!
One wonders how much of this is REALLY discussed in law schools
The plaintiff has to provide an “air tight” case to the lawyer, including paying for ALL experts to be used in the case.
Unfortunately, the facts are usually not readily apparent and often require extensive investigation to uncover facts that the defendant is trying very hard to conceal. There are very few cases such as “up and coming brain surgeon get’s rear ended by an oil truck and is a cripple for life, but the “ambulance chasers’ don’t stop trying.
 
Let’s face it, the cost of litigation being what it is today a plaintiff’s lawyer will simply NOT take a case unless it is pretty much open and shut, yet as I said, determining that often requires LOT of work the plaintiff”s counsel is unwilling to do KNOWING the alleged defenses raised by the defendant’s counsel are manipulations of the truth if not outright lies KNOWING there will NEVER be consequences for those lies which the plaintiff’s own lawyer will give credibility to to make some quick easy money
This is how the “game” is played, unless the plaintiff is wealthy and can actually pay for the investigators, experts and lawyers to ferret through the garbage raised by the defense
Everybody KNOWS the system is a FARCE  and the poor and middle class suffer the most and the people with the power to change things have NO interest in doing so.
But the most inexcusable behavior behavior in all this is not the lawyers, but the judges(former lawyers) they know only too well how the system works and what the truth is in a case pretty quickly but since most judges are political appointees they serve  the interests of those who appointed them, not the people Similar to my work as an expert, 90% of all forgeries are grossly  obvious but the legal and scientific hoops I have to jump through to prove that makes the process too expensive for the people who suffer the most.  Judging by who is suing who, the judges seem to making the decision to get rid of the “riff raff) who clog the courts. And even worse than the judges are the law makers, who also know the system since they are almost all lawyers who make very little effort to see that those individuals who seek justice have a snowball’s chance of getting.
But I have saved the best for last. Don’t lawyers realize how the public perceives the absurdity of the lawyer huksterers on TV which make a mockery of decent professionals who despise them, but hey-its Freedom of Speech they claim and they are making lots of money just like they were taught to do in law school–or were they.
 
Does anyone REALLY  care. Apparently not
So what is the answer?
 
Please tell me

Of even more importance  however, was the image which you projected from the stand, which together with  the substance of your testimony made an extremely impressive display. Thank you  again." 
George L.  Seltzer, Esq. 

"Your testimony was very helpful to the Court in  reaching it's decision in favor of the estate of [name redacted], deceased.  Judge Levy is a man of few words, but he did note the importance of your  testimony in reaching his conclusions from the evidence. I am certain that your  testimony was crucial in neutralizing the testimony of the attorney who  testified that he had witnessed the signature on the Deed. Mrs. [name redacted]  and I are very grateful for the assistance you rendered." 
William Bunting, Esq.

"Having been able to observe the expert  witnesses during their testimony, and considering the methodology utilized in  analyzing the questioned signature, and having heard their respective  testimony, we find that the testimony of Mr. Phillips was more persuasive than  that of [name redacted]." 
Judge Bonavitacola

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Phillips, Robert J carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Phillips, Robert J currently holds license 45338 (Hvac A/C Technician (Registered)), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Phillips, Robert J



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Phillips, Robert J



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Phillips, Robert J



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

for any job, commercial or residential.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Phillips Robert J carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Phillips Robert J currently holds license AR0012636 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Phillips Robert J



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Phillips Robert J



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Phillips Robert J



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
