Citibank Canada Reviews







September 9, 2008


Non-cooperative responce of Citibank Canada officials
								
				
I visited Citibank Canada office located at 123 Front Street, downtown Toronto on September 8, 2008 (Monday). Actually, I had an appointment for this visit at 2:30 pm but reached there a bit late. Anyway, I met a lady officer Adele Ngamala on 17th Floor of the the office and enquired about the easiest way to open a US dollars account in Citibank Canada. To my astonishment, the procedure explained by the officer concerned was so complicated and her attitude was so client-offensive that I had to drop the idea of opening a simple US dollars account in the Citibank. Now, I would prefer to have such account in any other international bank but citibank.
