Abstract
Context: Health communication campaigns including mass media and health-related product distribution have been used to reduce mortality and morbidity through behavior change. The intervention is defined as having two core components reflecting two social marketing principles: (1) promoting behavior change through multiple communication channels, one being mass media, and (2) distributing a free or reduced-price product that facilitates adoption and maintenance of healthy behavior change, sustains cessation of harmful behaviors, or protects against behavior-related disease or injury. Evidence acquisition: Using methods previously developed for the Community Guide, a systematic review (search period, January 1980-December 2009) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of health communication campaigns that use multiple channels, including mass media, and distribute health-related products. The primary outcome of interest was use of distributed health-related products. Evidence synthesis: Twenty-two studies that met Community Guide quality criteria were analyzed in 2010. Most studies showed favorable behavior change effects on health-related product use (a median increase of 8.4 percentage points). By product category, median increases in desired behaviors ranged from 4.0 percentage points for condom promotion and distribution campaigns to 10.0 percentage points for smoking-cessation campaigns. Conclusions: Health communication campaigns that combine mass media and other communication channels with distribution of free or reduced-price health-related products are effective in improving healthy behaviors. This intervention is expected to be applicable across U.S. demographic groups, with appropriate population targeting. The ability to draw more specific conclusions about other important social marketing practices is constrained by limited reporting of intervention components and characteristics.

Barbara K. Rimer, DrPH


Dean and Alumni Distinguished Professor, 2005 – present
Rimer served in several academic and government positions before coming to the School. Most recently, she was professor of community and family medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine and then director of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences of the National Cancer Institute. She is the first woman and first behavioral scientist to serve as the School’s dean.

Since becoming dean, Rimer has focused on several priorities, including improved communications; Carolina Public Health, a biannual magazine, was launched in 2005. Rimer has collaborated with faculty leaders to develop strategic initiatives to address obesity, global health, health disparities and water. A primary initiative is to create a supportive and diverse environment at the School. To that end, one of Rimer’s first acts as dean was to create the position of special assistant to the dean for diversity. She has emphasized the translation of research into policies, programs and practices that improve health.
Under Rimer’s leadership, the School received a $50 million gift from Dennis and Joan Gillings. A major product of the gift is creation of Gillings Innovation Laboratories to solve big public health problems in North Carolina and around the world.
“Public health focuses on people – people within populations. Thus, our impact can be huge, because our knowledge and interventions can shift whole populations toward improved health. The research being conducted in our School – and its application in communities – can truly change the world.”
Dean Rimer is co-editor and contributor for the book Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research, and Practice, now in its fourth edition, and also maintains the blog, Monday Morning.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREHealth Behavior: Theory, Research, And Practiceby Glanz, Karen (Edt)/ Rimer, Barbara K. (Edt)/ Viswanath, K. (Edt)"Health Behavior: Theory, Research, and Practice, Fifth Edition, is a thorough introduction to the practice of health education and health promotion, covering the theories, applications, and research of most use to public health students and practitioners. Through four editions, with more than 100,000 copies sold, this book has become the gold-standard textbook for health behavior courses. This essential resource includes the most current information on theory, research, and practice at individual, interpersonal, and community and group levels, with substantial new content on current and emerging theories of health communication, social marketing and e-health, culturally diverse communities, health promotion, the impact of stress, the importance of networks and community, social marketing, and evaluation. New contents include an update to the selection of theories, both established and emerging; e-health and social media as integrated into health communication; global health as an application of health behavior theory; culture and health disparities; more guidance on how to select suitable theories for specific problems/issues.  In addition to a selection of basic ancillary materials, the editors offer a dedicated website with student-written "theory in action" examples; expanded bibliographies; exemplar measures of theoretical constructs; and relevant links"--Preventive Medicine, Public HealthCondition: NewHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
