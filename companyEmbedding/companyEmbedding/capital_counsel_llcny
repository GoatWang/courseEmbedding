Capital Counsel Investment










Welcome
Capital Counsel, a registered investment adviser, was founded in 1999 on the belief that fundamental    valuation-based analysis can produce consistently good long-term investment returns. Fundamental analysis is a way of determining what a company is worth and reduces risk if you buy at that valuation. Historically, our patient adherence to a rigorous buy/sell discipline has provided clients with good long-term results and protection in declining markets.
