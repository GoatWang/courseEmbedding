I bought these for my father who has Alzheimer's. The nurses felt he would be much better with shoes that had velcro closures (easier for him & them)! The shoes arrived quickly and when I asked my Dad how they felt, he just gave me a huge smile. Winner...thanks Zappos. You are my go-to shoe company for both of my elderly parents who are unable to shop anymore. 
I'd also recommend:  Buy New Balance for my Mom

I tried this pair of shoes due to the velcro straps and extra width. I was concerned about the high price, but they are worth every penny. The straps hold well and the shoe is well made. I use to buy the Hush Puppy with lace ties(over 20 pairs over the years). The Drew is an upgrade and I found my new shoe.

Technology, Art, Music and New Television Commercial Intersect to Engage Hoops Fans
PURCHASE, N.Y., Feb. 11, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, Mountain Dew® announced its plans as an official NBA partner to deliver a damn good time throughout NBA All-Star 2016, including "Court Vision: An Interactive Virtual Reality Art Experience" and "Make An Introduction," a television spot airing in the U.S. and Canada featuring DEW® athletes and 2016 NBA All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Jimmy Butler, and rising star Julius Randle.
In 2015, PepsiCo and the NBA announced a multi-year marketing partnership to unite the passionate fans of the NBA with the power of PepsiCo's food and beverage brands, including Mountain Dew, Aquafina, Brisk and Ruffles. Mountain Dew serves as the lead brand in North America for the partnership, joining longtime PepsiCo brand Gatorade, which has been an NBA partner since 1984. 
"The Mountain Dew brand is all about finding and delivering awesome, one-of-a-kind experiences to DEW Nation," said Greg Lyons, senior vice president of marketing, Mountain Dew. "The NBA partnership has been a natural fit for us, and we're pumped to help deliver an immersive All-Star experience to hoops fans – one that symbolizes how the game starts on the court, but lives everywhere."
Mountain Dew plans to unleash a number of interactive and energizing events in and outside of Toronto during NBA All-Star 2016, including: 
Court Vision: An Interactive Virtual Reality Art ExperienceHosted by Mountain Dew at Artscape Sandbox in downtown Toronto, convenient to both the Air Canada Centre and Ricoh Coliseum, this highly interactive fan event will feature Tilt Brush, Google's virtual reality application which lets you paint in three-dimensional space with endless possibilities. In collaboration with PepsiCo Creator, the company's marketing innovation team that co-creates never-before-seen, culturally-relevant programs for consumers, the event will showcase emerging artists from Toronto and the U.S. who will create basketball-inspired 3D artwork with Tilt Brush.
Fans on-site will also be able to demo Tilt Brush and create artwork while sampling DEW products and enjoying the sounds of live DJs, as well as experience live appearances from Mountain Dew athletes and NBA All-Stars throughout the weekend. Visit www.mountaindew.com/nba for event details. Fans beyond Toronto can follow the excitement via the Mountain Dew social channels to get all-access coverage throughout the weekend using #DEWxNBA.
"Make An Introduction" TV Commercial LaunchMountain Dew is excited to debut a new TV commercial titled "Make An Introduction" featuring NBA All-Stars Russell Westbrook and Jimmy Butler, as well as rising star Julius Randle. The commercial will demonstrate how the game starts on the court, but the lifestyle around the game lives everywhere. It will air for the first time in the U.S. and Canada during NBA All-Star, extending the reach of the Mountain Dew All-Star experience outside of Toronto. Fans can view the digital version here to check out the very first DEWxNBA TV commercial. 
Painting Union Station GreenMountain Dew is going to make an NBA All-Star Weekend splash throughout several high traffic areas around Union Station in Toronto with a major out-of-home advertising installation. From wall murals and door decals to floor and column wraps, the artwork showcases how DEW athletes charge the game both on and off the court, and celebrates the vibrant personalities and unique styles of the NBA's biggest stars.
DEW All-Star DJsMountain Dew is charging the DJs throughout NBA All-Star by bringing top NBA DJs to various NBA events around Toronto. Fans everywhere can visit www.nba.com/dewwarmup starting Thursday, Feb.11 at 12 p.m. ET to vote to choose their favorite East Conference and West Conference team warm-up songs to be played live while NBA players get warmed-up for the 2016 NBA All-Star Game.  
NBA All-Star Celebrity Game Presented by Mountain DewMountain Dew is the presenting sponsor of this year's NBA All-Star Celebrity Game on Friday, Feb. 12, at 7 p.m. ET, on ESPN in the U.S. and TSN and SportsNet 1 in Canada, which will feature some of the hottest celebrities from film, TV and music, along with top NBA & WNBA Legends taking their skills to Ricoh Coliseum for a fun and entertaining basketball game. The game will pit Canada vs. the U.S., with DEW athlete and 2016 NBA All-Star Isaiah Thomas as an assistant coach on the U.S. team.

Product Strategy
Product Strategy: The basic strategy of Pepsi co. for Mountain Dew is continuous improvement and customization. Mountain dew is improved as a result of extensive R&D and is customized as per market or customers expectation. For instance, one of the key ingredients in Mountain Dew is caffeine. After customizing the formula of basic Mountain Dew they removed caffeine and thus formed the improved formula of diet Mountain dew. They even customize the product keeping in mind the region in which they are selling the product .For example, in Canada sucrose is used as sweetener in mountain dew where in US fructose corn syrup is used as sweetener.
Another important product strategy that they follow is they improve the existing formula, come up with new improved or customized version and release it in market for short spans of 8-10 weeks. Based on customer's response and feedback, they continue/discontinue the mass production of this new formula. Hence whole production set up is not needed until the trial is successful. This saves a lot of money and helps in building excitement in market about the product.

It is strongly associated with adventure and adrenaline pumping sports. Its brand ambassadors are people from various daring sports such as racing car drivers, skaters, mountain bikers. Pepsi uses a various promotion channels to market this product. The various elements of promotional strategies are direct marketing, sales promotion, advertisements, public relations etc (Arens 2006, p. 198).
Direct Marketing
Internet is the most prominent medium used for promoting it. There are lot of ads, competitions on internet to create product awareness and increase customer base for this product. It uses Facebook and Twitter to connect to its target customer base. Its own website runs a host of games and challenges to reward its customers. Many freebies such as clothing accessories, product packages, and games etc are given by Mountain dew via various competitions to promote the brand. The main advantage of this approach is that since most of their target customers are young and they remain online for most of the time it is easy to reach them.
Advertisements
Broadcast Media: There are many ads shown on television that contain extreme stunts and fearless actions. These are typically created to focus on the target market of young adventurers. The key advantage of this medium is to reach wider customer base easily.
Public Relations
Public relations are taken seriously by Mountain Dew. They are involved in a series of social initiatives which are helping in improving the brand visibility and acceptance. Some of them are:
Sponsorship: It sponsors a number of programs like Living on the Edge and Survivors Series and sports personnel. As the product targets young people, this sponsorship fits their image and helps to form brand image as brand for fearless, daring and enthusiastic people.
Special Events: It organizes special events like road shows, mountain riding and bike racing etc. This helps them increase brand visibility, influence potential customers, promote new products and get feedback on existing products.
Pricing Strategy
Pricing strategy of a product is defined by Market segmentation, competitor's pricing and positioning of the product. Analysing consumer behaviour is important factor in deciding the base price of a product and consumers have certain behaviour on buying a product on the basis of its price (Kotler, Keller, Koshy, & Jha, 2009). The various steps in pricing strategy and what Mountain Dew does in each area is:
Establish a goal for pricing: Mountain Dew's goal is to increase its market share and as well as to survive against its competitors.
Estimate Demand and other costs: Mountain Dew understands that their target market is loyal to the brand. The best thing to do is to retain this and create new demand. That's why they keep on bringing new flavours while retaining popular products. It also considers all the costs, such as procuring, production, packaging etc, involved in making the final product in order to decide upon a base price.
Set the basic pricing strategy for deciding the price: The pricing objective of Mountain Dew is Sales oriented. In order to achieve this it needs to capture maximum market share. Hence it uses competitive pricing to achieve the expected market size. It keeps its prices in close proximity of sprite which is its main competitor.
In the highly competitive soft drinks market the key is to have the widest market share. Mountain dew is also vying for this. Their pricing objective is sales oriented and they maintain competitive pricing strategy to keep ahead of the competition. Besides its target market is either youngsters or teenagers and they don't have a lot of money to spend. So Mountain dew keeps pricing at low profit margin as compared to competition.
Mountain Dew Price vs. Quality Map
Above perceptual map depicts a comparison of Mountain Dew with its primary competitors on the scales of price and quality. The Mountain Dew's in comparison to its competition is widely sold and has maximum loyalty and is a reputed brand. Its closest competitor Sprite is from Coca Cola group. Though Sprite is higher in price its quality proposition isn't higher than Mountain Dew. Besides it also doesn't have many variations like Mountain Dew. Canada Dry (Ginger ale) a product of Dr Pepper group. It is sold at a price way higher than its competition and is not as widely available. Quality wise its composition is better than Mountain dew or Sprite but it doesn't enjoy that sort of brand loyalty.
Mountain Dew Price/Attribute Map
In the above map Mountain Dew is compared with its competitors on the price-attribute basis. The attribute is caffeine content present. Mountain Dew is cheapest and has maximum caffeine content. Closely tied is Yello Mello. It is a close competitor of Mountain Dew in some geographical areas. Per 12 oz. Mountain Dew has 54 mg caffeine while Yello Mello has 53 mg. Canada Dry ginger ale has least caffeine in these three. Per 12 oz. It has only 9 mg of it.
Recommendations for Strategies
Mountain Dew is not a product for masses. It caters a very niche market. The recommendations for alternative approaches in strategies have been made with respect to the target market.
Recommendations for Product
As this product targets young generation it can come up with stylish packaging, shape and design of bottles. Since most of the adventure sports that the company endorse happen in natural surroundings, so it might be worth to make the product composition more natural. This will further add to its appeal to sports people.
Recommendations for Pricing
The pricing objective of Mountain dew is to increase sales and to increase its markets share it even competes with intra company offerings e.g. 7 UP. But in doing so, it is already selling mountain dew at a price equivalent to or lower than its competitors price. One approach it can take to further make the pricing attractive is to follow the product bundling approach. That way it can sell more units while reducing the production costs. It can also offer discounts on special occasions to promote sales.
Recommendations for Place
Pepsi Bottling Group (PBG) manages all the distribution of Pepsi co. in US. This can be applied on various countries to increase distribution. Besides there could be number of third party distribution channels (Producer-Distributor-Retailer-Consumer (P-D-R-C)) so that product can reach rural areas and hence help to increase customer base.
Recommendations for Promotion
Till now Mountain Dew is using various promotional ads highlighting adventures acts, spine thrilling stunts etc. This is good for the target niche market it focuses on and shouldn't dither from this path. The product marketing team can hire celebrities who work in areas of action, adventure to promote it further. This way their fan following will also take interest in this product. Besides some inspirational ads can be made, using this product, to invigorate adventure spirit in people. This will help people relate to it better.
Conclusion
Mountain Dew is a product meant for a niche market. It focuses on youth and teenagers and the product is promoted to them using adventure sports as a medium. This adds to the appeal of the product. The product strategy followed by Pepsi is continuous improvement and customization. It relies on customer feedback to reinvent the product. The product is priced very competitively to gain market share. It is promoted using internet, public relations, and electronic media as most of its target customers use these mediums. To conclude, Mountain Dew exists in a very competitive market place where margins are thin and to survive you need to have some speciality and a loyal customer base.
Recommendations
Following are some recommendations for Mountain Dew:
It might be better to make the composition of Mountain Dew more natural.
Product bundling will help in reducing production costs and sales price.
Third party distribution channels will help reach wider geographical area.
Inspirational ads to stimulate adventure spirit of people will help it connect to people in a better way.
