First Credit Advisors
First Credit Advisors originated in June of 2000 when a major municipal bond fund management company signed a contract with First Kentucky Securities Corporation to provide credit research and reporting for their Kentucky municipal bond fund. The management company also asked First Kentucky to provide the same independent municipal portfolio credit advisory support for one of their western state funds. It was then that First Credit Advisors was formed. Soon First Credit Advisors was providing credit advisory support for six state-specific municipal bond funds with over $2 billion in holdings – and they continue to grow.
We have been tasked by banks, trust departments and individual investors to research the credit quality of municipal bond holdings which have been downgraded or even dropped by the rating agencies. Investor-oriented, private credit reviews by seasoned professionals is a service that is repeatedly provided for our clients.
Because First Credit Advisors’ partners and staff are also originating, structuring, buying and selling municipal securities every day through First Kentucky Securities Corporation, they are able to provide clients with unequaled support in assessing credit risk and realistic price levels in today’s complicated municipal securities market.

R. Strand KramerSr. Vice PresidentMr. Kramer joined First Kentucky Securities Corporation in 1985. He is presently involved in the Public Finance Department as well as directing the Trading and Underwriting Department. Stan has worked with numerous Kentucky state and local issuers, both as fiscal agent and as managing underwriter. Prior to joining First Kentucky Securities, he was associated with Dupree & Company, Inc., as a fiscal agent/financial advisor and institutional salesperson. Stan has a Master’s degree in Business Administration and a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Kentucky.

Rodney KnoxMunicipal Market StrategistMr. Knox began his career in the municipal bond market with Bacon, Whipple & Co., Chicago, Illinois in 1968. From then until 1989, Rod participated in municipal bond originations, private placements, and competitive municipal bond underwritings with several Chicago municipal bond dealers. From 1990 until 1996, Rod had his own investment advisory firm in Tucson, Arizona. In 1996, he became a Senior Underwriter and Trader for First Security Bank (now Wells Fargo Bank) in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 2001, after the merger of First Security Bank and Wells Fargo, Rod assumed the position of Senior Underwriter and Municipal Product Manager for Commerce Bank in St. Louis, Missouri. Currently, Rod is the Director of Research for First Credit Advisors, LLC and a municipal market strategist for First Kentucky Securities Corp., as well as an independent consultant. Rod has a BSBA in accounting from Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois.
