The unit investment trusts names above (the "Portfolios") each invest in a
portfolio of securities. Of course, we cannot guarantee that a Portfolio will   
achieve its objective.                                                          

An investment can be made in the underlying funds directly rather than    
through a Portfolio. These direct investments can be made without paying the    
Portfolio sales charge, operating expenses and organization costs.

Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Equity and Income Portfolio          

Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks total return, consisting of high
current income and potential capital appreciation.                              

 Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closed-end investment 
companies (known as "closed-end funds") that invest significantly in equity or  
income-producing securities selected by Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc. 
These closed-end funds generally focus on income-producing securities, sectors  
or strategies, such as dividend strategies, covered call option strategies,     
total return strategies, balanced strategies, general equities (including both  
dividend and non-dividend paying equities), convertible securities, energy,     
health care, real estate, utility and other income-oriented strategies.         

   In selecting funds for the portfolio, Cohen & Steers sought to identify funds
that exhibited the following characteristics, among others:                     

1.   Daily trading volumes generally greater than $750,000 per day.   

 2.   Closed-end funds with market capitalization generally greater than
$300 million.                                               

3.   High current income.                                             

4.   Share prices at a discount to net asset value.                   

 5.   Undervalued funds where recent total return on market price trails
recent total return on net asset value.                     

     6.   Strong fundamentals, including liquidity, income coverage and quality,
         leverage/risk management. Cohen & Steers believes that a conservative
          approach to leverage helps mitigate the effects of changes in interest
rates.                                                      

7.   Well-known sponsors with experience managing the asset class.    

8.   Diversification of sector and asset class.                       

There can be no guarantee that a particular fund in the Portfolio will    
satisfy the criteria set forth above.                                           

Cohen & Steers believes that capital appreciation from equity and income  
focused closed-end funds could come from three potential sources:               

     o    A narrowing of fund share price discounts to net asset value, assuming
no change in fund net asset value;                          

o    Growth in fund share prices which mirrors growth in underlying   
          portfolio net asset value, with no change in the discount to net asset
value; and                                                  

o    Increased dividend/distribution rates by closed-end funds which  
attract investors and cause rising share prices.            

  Cohen & Steers believes that there is a compelling investment opportunity in
the secondary market for closed-end funds. Cohen & Steers believes that five    
primary factors support this investment case, including:                        

o   Rising Demand for Dividend Income - Cohen & Steers believes that the
       potential for rising demand for dividend income exists due to the aging
 of America, lower tax rates, the inflation protection that may be
       offered by rising dividends, and the low return environment. Of course,
    there can be no assurance that the Portfolio or the underlying funds
will provide income in the future.                              

o   Growth in the Number and Types of Closed-End Fund New Issues - Since
    2001, the closed-end fund market has grown by over $90 billion, to a
   total size in excess of $200 billion. There are now over 600 listed
   closed-end funds. Underlying asset classes have expanded to include
 significant volumes of funds focused on categories such as equity
        dividends, covered call option writing, REITs, utilities, energy, senior
   loan securities, convertible securities and limited duration bonds.

  o   Lack of Research and Institutional Capital - Historically, activity in
      the closed-end fund market has been dominated by individual investors,
       with only a handful of professional investors and institutional sources
 of capital. Due to a variety of historical factors, institutional
  participation in the closed-end fund market currently remains low.

   o   Need for Professional Selection - Many investors and financial advisors
       do not have the time or resources to assess dividend quality, leverage,
        net asset value risk, and historical market valuation to net asset value
of closed end funds.                                            

  o   Discounts to Net Asset Value - Current discounts to net asset value in
many funds and sectors may offer a timely opportunity to acquire
       attractive funds with income potential at a discount to their intrinsic
value.                                                          

Approximately 50% of the closed-end funds in the Portfolio are funds      
classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These 
funds have the ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a
single issuer and may also own more than 10% of the outstanding voting          
securities of an issuer. These factors could reduce diversification.            

Of course, we cannot guarantee that your Portfolio will achieve its       
objective. The value of your Units may fall below the price you paid for the    
Units. You should read the "Risk Factors" section before you invest.            

The Portfolio Consultant. Founded in 1986, Cohen & Steers Capital Management
Inc. has approximately $29.9 billion in assets under management, primarily in   
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and including more than $1.9 billion in   
preferred securities and more than $1.6 billion in utility securities. Cohen &  
Steers manages separate account portfolios for institutional investors,         
including some of the world's largest pension funds and endowments. In addition,
the firm manages open- and closed-end mutual funds for both retail and          
institutional investors. Cohen & Steers is among the largest REIT managers in   
the U.S. and employs a significant research and trading staff. Many investors   
have come to view Cohen & Steers as an important source for income-oriented     
investment products. Cohen & Steers also acts as Supervisor of the Portfolio. As
described above, Cohen & Steers advises other clients such as investment        
companies and other accounts. Many of these client accounts are "managed"       
accounts. The Portfolio is not a managed fund and will generally not sell or    
replace Securities. Please refer to "Objectives and Securities Selection" for a 
discussion of Cohen & Steers' activities regarding the advisory accounts of its 
other clients and the effect these activities may have on the Securities in the 
Portfolio.                                                                      

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This
can happen for reasons such as these:                                           

    o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.                                                  

   o    A security issuer may be unwilling or unable to declare dividends in
       the future, or may reduce the level of dividends declared. This may
    reduce the level of dividends a closed-end fund pays which would
     reduce your income and may cause the value of your Units to fall.

    o    The financial condition of a security issuer may worsen or its credit
          ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.
     This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary
offering period.                                            

o    The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. You should  
          understand the section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest. In
      particular, shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from
          their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such
  as the manager's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market
      conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. The
    Portfolio and the underlying funds have management and operating
  expenses. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's
         expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing
        in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would
incur if you invested directly in the funds.                

  o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. While the closed-end funds
 have managed portfolios, except in limited circumstances, the
      Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same funds
even if their market value declines.

 Example

  This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not      
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and    
expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following     
expenses for every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio. The amounts are the same
regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or        
continue to hold your investment.                                               

1 year                             $     525                          
3 years                                  901                          
5 years                                1,301                          
5 1/4 years (Life of Portfolio)        1,353                          

  The maximum sales charge is 3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge       
(maximum of 3.00% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining    
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred  
sales charge is fixed at $0.150 per Unit and accrues daily from August 10, 2007 
through January 9, 2008. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this     
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid 
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period   
(anticipated to be two months) or six months following the Initial Date of      
Deposit. The Portfolio assesses the Supervisory Fee as a percentage of the daily
net asset value (0.025%). Other annual expenses are assessed as dollar amounts  
per Unit.                                                                       

    Although not an actual operating expense, the Portfolio, and therefore the
Unitholders, will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the funds held by   
the Portfolio in the estimated amount provided above. Estimated fund expenses   
are based upon the net asset value of the number of fund shares held by the     
Portfolio per Unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the funds for 
the most recent fiscal year.

Closed-End Strategy: Senior Loan and Limited Duration Portfolio                 

Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks to provide high current income. 

 Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio primarily consisting of common stock of closed-end  
investment companies (known as "closed-end funds") that invest in senior        
corporate loans or other debt securities of limited duration.                   

"Duration" is a measure of the sensitivity of a debt security's price to  
changes in interest rates, expressed in years. Each year of duration represents 
an expected 1 percent change in the price of a security for every 1 percent     
change in interest rates (i.e., a 5-year duration means the security should fall
about 5 percent in value if interest rates rise by 1 percent, and vice versa).  
Higher durations signify greater price volatility.                              

Approximately 20% of the closed-end funds in the Portfolio are funds      
classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These 
funds have the ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a
single issuer and may also own more than 10% of the outstanding voting          
securities of an issuer. These factors could reduce diversification.            

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This
can happen for reasons such as these:                                           

    o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.                                                  

 o    The value of the securities in the closed-end funds will generally
        fall if interest rates, in general, rise. No one can predict whether
interest rates will rise or fall in the future.             

     o    The borrower on a loan may be unable to make interest and/or principal
    payments in the future. This may reduce the level of dividends a
     closed-end fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the
value of your units to fall.                                

  o    The financial condition of a loan borrower may worsen or its credit
          ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your units.
     This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary
offering period.                                            

 o    The closed-end funds held by the Portfolio invest in senior loans.
     Although senior loans in which the closed-end funds invest may be
  secured by specific collateral, there can be no assurance that
        liquidation of collateral would satisfy the borrower's obligation in
       the event of non-payment of scheduled principal or interest or that
          such collateral could be readily liquidated. Senior loans in which the
          closed-end funds invest generally are of below investment grade credit
        quality, may be unrated at the time of investment, generally are not
       registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or any state
         securities commission, and generally are not listed on any securities
        exchange. In addition, the amount of public information available on
          senior loans generally is less extensive than that available for other
types of assets.                                            

o    The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. You should  
          understand the section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest. In
      particular, shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from
          their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such
  as the manager's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market
      conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. The
    Portfolio and the underlying funds have management and operating
  expenses. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's
         expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing
        in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would
incur if you invested directly in the funds.                

   o    The closed-end funds may invest in securities rated below investment
          grade and are considered to be "junk" securities. These securities are
      considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and
 credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than
          investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more
     sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make
early returns of principal.                                 

  o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. While the closed-end funds
 have managed portfolios, except in limited circumstances, the
      Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same funds
even if their market value declines.

 Example

  This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not      
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and    
expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following     
expenses for every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio. The amounts are the same
regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or        
continue to hold your investment.                                               

1 year                             $     499                          
3 years                                  864                          
5 years                                1,252                          
5 1/4 years (Life of Portfolio)        1,303                          

  The maximum sales charge is 3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge       
(maximum of 3.00% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining    
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred  
sales charge is fixed at $0.150 per Unit and accrues daily from August 10, 2007 
through January 9, 2008. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this     
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid 
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period   
(anticipated to be two months) or six months following the Initial Date of      
Deposit.                                                                        

    Although not an actual operating expense, the Portfolio, and therefore the
Unitholders, will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the funds held by   
the Portfolio in the estimated amount provided above. Estimated fund expenses   
are based upon the net asset value of the number of fund shares held by the     
Portfolio per Unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the funds for 
the most recent fiscal year.

Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio                     

Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks high current income.            

 Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closed-end investment 
companies (known as "closed-end funds") selected by Cohen & Steers Capital      
Management, Inc. These closed-end funds generally seek to invest in             
income-producing securities or strategies, such as preferred securities,        
convertible bonds, real estate investment trusts (REITs), high yield securities,
emerging markets bonds, corporate bonds, covered call option strategies and     
other income-oriented strategies.                                               

 In selecting funds for the Portfolio, Cohen & Steers sought to select funds
with strong fundamentals, well-known sponsors with experience managing the asset
class and diversification of sector and asset class. In addition, in selecting  
funds for the Portfolio, Cohen & Steers sought to select funds with daily       
trading volumes generally greater than $1 million per day and funds with market 
capitalization generally greater than $300 million. There can be no guarantee   
that a particular fund in the Portfolio will satisfy the criteria set forth     
above.                                                                          

  Cohen & Steers believes that there is a compelling investment opportunity in
the secondary market for closed-end funds. Cohen & Steers believes that five    
primary factors support this investment case, including:                        

o   Rising Demand for Dividend Income - Cohen & Steers believes that the
       potential for rising demand for dividend income exists due to the aging
 of America, lower tax rates, the inflation protection that may be
       offered by rising dividends, and the low return environment. Of course,
    there can be no assurance that the Portfolio or the underlying funds
will provide income in the future.                              

o   Growth in the Number and Types of Closed-End Fund New Issues - Since
    2001, the closed-end fund market has grown by over $90 billion, to a
   total size in excess of $200 billion. There are now over 600 listed
   closed-end funds. Underlying asset classes have expanded to include
 significant volumes of funds focused on categories such as equity
        dividends, covered call option writing, REITs, utilities, energy, senior
   loan securities, convertible securities and limited duration bonds.

  o   Lack of Research and Institutional Capital - Historically, activity in
      the closed-end fund market has been dominated by individual investors,
       with only a handful of professional investors and institutional sources
 of capital. Due to a variety of historical factors, institutional
  participation in the closed-end fund market currently remains low.

   o   Need for Professional Selection - Many investors and financial advisors
       do not have the time or resources to assess dividend quality, leverage,
        net asset value risk, and historical market valuation to net asset value
of closed end funds.                                            

  o   Discounts to Net Asset Value - Current discounts to net asset value in
many funds and sectors may offer a timely opportunity to acquire
       attractive funds with income potential at a discount to their intrinsic
value.                                                          

Approximately 25% of the closed-end funds in the Portfolio are funds      
classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These 
funds have the ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a
single issuer and may also own more than 10% of the outstanding voting          
securities of an issuer. These factors could reduce diversification.            

Of course, we cannot guarantee that your Portfolio will achieve its       
objective. The value of your Units may fall below the price you paid for the    
Units. You should read the "Risk Factors" section before you invest.            

The Portfolio Consultant. Founded in 1986, Cohen & Steers Capital Management
Inc. has approximately $29.9 billion in assets under management, primarily in   
real estate investment trusts (REITs) and including more than $1.9 billion in   
preferred securities and more than $1.6 billion in utility securities. Cohen &  
Steers manages separate account portfolios for institutional investors,         
including some of the world's largest pension funds and endowments. In addition,
the firm manages open- and closed-end mutual funds for both retail and          
institutional investors. Cohen & Steers is among the largest REIT managers in   
the U.S. and employs a significant research and trading staff. Many investors   
have come to view Cohen & Steers as an important source for income-oriented     
investment products. Cohen & Steers also acts as Supervisor of the Portfolio. As
described above, Cohen & Steers advises other clients such as investment        
companies and other accounts. Many of these client accounts are "managed"       
accounts. The Portfolio is not a managed fund and will generally not sell or    
replace Securities. Please refer to "Objectives and Securities Selection" for a 
discussion of Cohen & Steers' activities regarding the advisory accounts of its 
other clients and the effect these activities may have on the Securities in the 
Portfolio.                                                                      

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This
can happen for reasons such as these:                                           

    o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.                                                  

 o    The value of the securities in the closed-end funds will generally
        fall if interest rates, in general, rise. No one can predict whether
interest rates will rise or fall in the future.             

o    A security issuer may be unable to make interest and/or principal
    payments in the future. This may reduce the level of dividends a
     closed-end fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the
value of your Units to fall.                                

    o    The financial condition of a security issuer may worsen or its credit
          ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.
     This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary
offering period.                                            

o    The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. You should  
          understand the section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest. In
      particular, shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from
          their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such
  as the manager's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market
      conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. The
    Portfolio and the underlying funds have management and operating
  expenses. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's
         expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing
        in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would
incur if you invested directly in the funds.                

   o    The closed-end funds may invest in securities rated below investment
          grade and are considered to be "junk" securities. These securities are
      considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and
 credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than
          investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more
     sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make
early returns of principal.                                 

  o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. While the closed-end funds
 have managed portfolios, except in limited circumstances, the
      Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same funds
even if their market value declines.

 Example

  This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not      
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and    
expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following     
expenses for every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio. The amounts are the same
regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or        
continue to hold your investment.                                               

1 year                             $     498                          
3 years                                  851                          
5 years                                1,227                          
5 1/4 years (Life of Portfolio)        1,276                          

  The maximum sales charge is 3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge       
(maximum of 3.00% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining    
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred  
sales charge is fixed at $0.150 per Unit and accrues daily from August 10, 2007 
through January 9, 2008. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this     
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid 
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period   
(anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial Date of    
Deposit. The Portfolio assesses the Supervisory Fee as a percentage of the daily
net asset value (0.025%). Other annual expenses are assessed as dollar amounts  
per Unit.                                                                       

    Although not an actual operating expense, the Portfolio, and therefore the
Unitholders, will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the funds held by   
the Portfolio in the estimated amount provided above. Estimated fund expenses   
are based upon the net asset value of the number of fund shares held by the     
Portfolio per Unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the funds for 
the most recent fiscal year.

Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio--         
National Series                                                                 

Investment Objective. The Portfolio seeks to provide income exempt from   
federal income tax.                                                             

 Principal Investment Strategy. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective
by investing in a portfolio consisting of common stock of closed-end investment 
companies (known as "closed-end funds") selected by Cohen & Steers Capital      
Management, Inc. (the "Portfolio Consultant"). These closed-end funds generally 
seek to invest in tax-exempt municipal bonds. Income may be subject to the      
alternative minimum tax and state and local taxes.                              

  The Portfolio Consultant sought to construct a well-diversified portfolio of
leveraged closed-end funds that have strong fundamentals and are sponsored by   
well-regarded managers in this asset class. Cohen & Steers believes that the    
large number of national and single state municipal closed-end funds - there are
nearly 300 funds at this time - contribute to secondary market inefficiencies in
this sector. In selecting funds for the Portfolio, the Portfolio Consultant     
generally considered only funds with a ten-day average daily trading volume     
greater than $400,000 and a market capitalization greater than $300,000,000 at  
the time of selection. In general, after screening out funds that did not meet  
the above criteria, Cohen & Steers then applied a proprietary selection         
methodology for including Funds in the Portfolio. The Cohen & Steers proprietary
methodology evaluates a series of factors, including, but not limited to, the   
following factors:                                                              

o    Current dividend yield;                                          

o    Share price premium/discount to net asset value;                 

o    Amount and type of leverage in the capital structure;            

o    Portfolio sensitivity to interest rate changes - theoretical and 
actual historical;                                          

  o    Use and percentage amount of interest rate swaps and other interest
rate hedging strategies;                                    

o    Estimate of fund earnings power;                                 

o    Embedded dividend payment cushion;                               

o    Expense ratios;                                                  

o    Historical track record; and                                     

o    History with regard to dividend changes.                         

After evaluating each of the screened funds, the Portfolio Consultant uses
its proprietary valuation model to score each fund. The Cohen & Steers          
Closed-End Fund Investment Committee reviews the results of the screening       
process to select funds for inclusion in the Portfolio. Funds advised by the    
Sponsor, the Portfolio Consultant and their affiliates were excluded from       
consideration for the Portfolio in an effort to maintain independence in the    
portfolio selection process.                                                    

Approximately 48% of the closed-end funds in the Portfolio are funds      
classified as "non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These 
funds have the ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a
single issuer and may also own more than 10% of the outstanding voting          
securities of an issuer. These factors could reduce diversification.            

  Principal Risks. As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in
this Portfolio. The Portfolio also might not perform as well as you expect. This
can happen for reasons such as these:                                           

    o    Security prices will fluctuate. The value of your investment may fall
over time.                                                  

 o    The value of the securities in the closed-end funds will generally
        fall if interest rates, in general, rise. No one can predict whether
interest rates will rise or fall in the future.             

o    A security issuer may be unable to make interest and/or principal
    payments in the future. This may reduce the level of dividends a
     closed-end fund pays which would reduce your income and cause the
value of your Units to fall.                                

    o    The financial condition of a security issuer may worsen or its credit
          ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units.
     This may occur at any point in time, including during the primary
offering period.                                            

o    The Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. You should  
          understand the section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest. In
      particular, shares of these funds tend to trade at a discount from
          their net asset value and are subject to risks related to factors such
  as the manager's ability to achieve a fund's objective, market
      conditions affecting a fund's investments and use of leverage. The
    Portfolio and the underlying funds have management and operating
  expenses. You will bear not only your share of the Portfolio's
         expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By investing
        in other funds, the Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would
incur if you invested directly in the funds.                

   o    The closed-end funds may invest in securities rated below investment
          grade and are considered to be "junk" securities. These securities are
      considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and
 credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than
          investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more
     sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make
early returns of principal.                                 

  o    We do not actively manage the portfolio. While the closed-end funds
 have managed portfolios, except in limited circumstances, the
      Portfolio will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same funds
even if their market value declines.

 Example

  This example helps you compare the cost of the Portfolio with other unit
trusts and mutual funds. In the example we assume that the expenses do not      
change and that the Portfolio's annual return is 5%. Your actual returns and    
expenses will vary. Based on these assumptions, you would pay the following     
expenses for every $10,000 you invest in the Portfolio. The amounts are the same
regardless of whether you sell your investment at the end of a period or        
continue to hold your investment.

5 1/4 years (Life of Portfolio)        1,189                          

  The maximum sales charge is 3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit.
The initial sales charge is the difference between the total sales charge       
(maximum of 3.00% of the Public Offering Price) and the sum of the remaining    
deferred sales charge and the total creation and development fee. The deferred  
sales charge is fixed at $0.150 per Unit and accrues daily from August 10, 2007 
through January 9, 2008. Your Portfolio pays a proportionate amount of this     
charge on the 10th day of each month beginning in the accrual period until paid 
in full. The combination of the initial and deferred sales charges comprises the
"transactional sales charge". The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.05
per Unit and is paid at the earlier of the end of the initial offering period   
(anticipated to be three months) or six months following the Initial Date of    
Deposit. The Portfolio assesses the Supervisory Fee as a percentage of the daily
net asset value (0.025%). Other annual expenses are assessed as dollar amounts

    Although not an actual operating expense, the Portfolio, and therefore the
Unitholders, will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the funds held by   
the Portfolio in the estimated amount provided above. Estimated fund expenses   
are based upon the net asset value of the number of fund shares held by the     
Portfolio per Unit multiplied by the annual operating expenses of the funds for 
the most recent fiscal year.

1    As of close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The
        actual distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount
         due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income
        received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in
       the Portfolio such as the acquisition or liquidation of securities.
See "Rights of Unitholders -- Estimated Distributions."     

2    The Trustee will make distributions of income and capital on each
       monthly Distribution Date to Unitholders of record on the preceding
          Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution equals
          at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net asset value. Undistributed income
        and capital will be distributed in the next month in which the total
          cash held for distribution equals at least 0.1% of the Portfolio's net
       asset value. Based on the foregoing, it is currently estimated that
     the initial distribution set forth above will occur in June 2007.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Unitholders of Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Series 663:                 

We have audited the accompanying statements of condition including the    
related portfolios of Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Equity and     
Income Portfolio, Series 5, Closed-End Strategy: Senior Loan and Limited        
Duration Portfolio, Series 12, Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Income
Portfolio, Series 11 and Closed-End Strategy: Cohen & Steers Master Municipal   
Income Portfolio - National Series 8 (included in Van Kampen Unit Trusts, Series
663) as of April 12, 2007. The statements of condition and portfolios are the   
responsibility of the Sponsor. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on   
such financial statements based on our audits.                                  

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public    
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
statements of condition are free of material misstatement. The trusts are not   
required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal       
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal 
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that 
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an  
opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over financial     
reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes      
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in  
the statements of condition, assessing the accounting principles used and       
significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as well as evaluating the overall    
statements of condition presentation. Our procedures included confirmation with 
The Bank of New York, Trustee, of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit       
deposited for the purchase of Securities as shown in the statements of condition
as of April 12, 2007. We believe that our audits of the statements of condition 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                    

   In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Closed-End Strategy: Cohen &   
Steers Master Equity and Income Portfolio, Series 5, Closed-End Strategy: Senior
Loan and Limited Duration Portfolio, Series 12, Closed-End Strategy: Cohen &

Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio - National Series 8 (included in Van

accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)The value of the Securities is determined by the Trustee on the bases set    
forth under "Public Offering--Unit Price". The contracts to purchase      
Securities are collateralized by an irrevocable letter of credit which has
been deposited with the Trustee.                                          

(2)A portion of the Public Offering Price represents an amount sufficient to    
   pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the Portfolio.
The amount of these costs are set forth in the "Fee Table". A distribution
will be made as of the close of the initial offering period to an account 
 maintained by the Trustee from which the organization expense obligation of
   the investors will be satisfied. To the extent that actual organization costs
of the Portfolio are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated
 organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be reimbursed to
the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Portfolio.                

(3)Represents the amount of mandatory distributions from the Portfolio on the   
bases set forth under "Public Offering".                                  

(4)The creation and development fee is payable by the Portfolio on behalf of    
   Unitholders out of the assets of the Portfolio as of the close of the initial
offering period. If Units are redeemed prior to the close of the initial  
public offering period, the fee will not be deducted from the proceeds.   

(5)The aggregate public offering price and the aggregate mandatory sales charge 
are computed on the bases set forth under "Public Offering".              

(6)Assumes the maximum sales charge.                                            

THE PORTFOLIOS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The Portfolios were created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant
to a Trust Indenture and Trust Agreement (the "Trust Agreement"), dated the date
of this prospectus (the "Initial Date of Deposit"), among Van Kampen Funds Inc.,
as Sponsor, Cohen & Steers Capital Management, Inc., as Supervisor of the Cohen 
& Steers Master Equity and Income Portfolio, the Cohen & Steers Master Income   
Portfolio and the Cohen & Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio-National     
Series and Van Kampen Asset Management, as Supervisor for the Senior Loan and   
Limited Duration Portfolio, and The Bank of New York, as Trustee.               

Each Portfolio offers investors the opportunity to purchase Units         
representing proportionate interests in a portfolio of shares of closed-end     
funds. A Portfolio may be an appropriate medium for investors who desire to     
participate in a portfolio of securities with greater diversification than they 
might be able to acquire individually.                                          

On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited delivery statements 
relating to contracts for the purchase of the Securities and an irrevocable     
letter of credit in the amount required for these purchases with the Trustee. In
exchange for these contracts the Trustee delivered to the Sponsor documentation 
evidencing the ownership of Units of the Portfolios. Unless otherwise terminated
as provided in the Trust Agreement, a Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory 
Termination Date and any remaining Securities will be liquidated or distributed 
by the Trustee within a reasonable time. As used in this prospectus the term    
"Securities" means the securities (including contracts to purchase these        
securities) listed in each "Portfolio" and any additional securities deposited  
into a Portfolio.                                                               

Additional Units of a Portfolio may be issued at any time by depositing in
the Portfolio (i) additional Securities, (ii) contracts to purchase Securities  
together with cash or irrevocable letters of credit or (iii) cash (or a letter  
of credit or the equivalent) with instructions to purchase additional           
Securities. As additional Units are issued by a Portfolio, the aggregate value  
of the Securities will be increased and the fractional undivided interest       
represented by each Unit will be decreased. The Sponsor may continue to make    
additional deposits into a Portfolio following the Initial Date of Deposit      
provided that the additional deposits will be in amounts which will maintain, as
nearly as practicable, the same percentage relationship among the number of     
shares of each Security in the Portfolio that existed immediately prior to the  
subsequent deposit. Investors may experience a dilution of their investments and
a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of
the Securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
Securities and because a Portfolio will pay the associated brokerage or         
acquisition fees. Purchases and sales of Securities by your Portfolio may impact
the value of the Securities. This may especially be the case during the initial 
offering of Units, upon Portfolio termination and in the course of satisfying   
large Unit redemptions.                                                         

Each Unit of your Portfolio initially offered represents an undivided     
interest in the Portfolio. At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the   
Initial Date of Deposit, the number of Units may be adjusted so that the Public 
Offering Price per Unit equals $10. The number of Units, fractional interest of 
each Unit in your Portfolio and the estimated distributions per Unit will       
increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment. To the extent that any    
Units are redeemed by the Trustee or additional Units are issued as a result of 
additional Securities being deposited by the Sponsor, the fractional undivided  
interest in your Portfolio represented by each unredeemed Unit will increase or 
decrease accordingly, although the actual interest in your Portfolio will remain
unchanged. Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the      
Trustee by Unitholders, which may include the Sponsor, or until the termination 
of the Trust Agreement.                                                         

Each Portfolio consists of (a) the Securities (including contracts for the
purchase thereof) listed under the applicable "Portfolio" as may continue to be 
held from time to time in the Portfolio, (b) any additional Securities acquired 
and held by the Portfolio pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and 
(c) any cash held in the related Income and Capital Accounts. Neither the       
Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be liable in any way for any failure in any of the
Securities.                                                                     

OBJECTIVES AND SECURITIES SELECTION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The objective of each Portfolio is described in the individual Portfolio  
sections. There is no assurance that a Portfolio will achieve its objective.    

The Portfolio Consultant of the Cohen & Steers Master Equity and Income   
Portfolio, the Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio and the Cohen & Steers    
Master Municipal Income Portfolio-National Series is not an affiliate of the    
Sponsor. The Sponsor did not select the Securities for the Portfolio. The       
Portfolio Consultant may use the list of Securities in its independent capacity 
as an investment adviser and distributes this information to various individuals
and entities. The Portfolio Consultant may recommend or effect transactions in  
the Securities. This may have an adverse effect on the prices of the Securities.
This also may have an impact on the price the Portfolio pay for the Securities  
and the price received upon Unit redemptions or Portfolio termination. The      
Portfolio Consultant may act as agent or principal in connection with the       
purchase and sale of securities, including the Securities. The Portfolio        
Consultant also issues reports and makes recommendations on the Securities. The 
Portfolio Consultant's research department may receive compensation based on    
commissions generated by research and/or sales of Units.                        

  Neither the Portfolio Consultants nor the Sponsor manage the Portfolios. You
should note that the Portfolio Consultant or Sponsor applied the selection      
criteria to the Securities for inclusion in the Portfolios prior to the Initial 
Date of Deposit. After the initial selection, the Securities may no longer meet 
the selection criteria. Should a Security no longer meet the selection criteria,
we will generally not remove the Security from a Portfolio. In offering the     
Units to the public, neither the Sponsor nor any broker-dealers are recommending
any of the individual Securities but rather the entire pool of Securities in a  
Portfolio, taken as a whole, which are represented by the Units.                

RISK FACTORS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All investments involve risk. This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your Portfolio or in the underlying funds.
You should understand these risks before you invest. If the value of the        
securities falls, the value of your Units will also fall. We cannot guarantee   
that your Portfolio will achieve its objective or that your investment return   
will be positive over any period.                                               

   Market Risk. Market risk is the risk that the value of the securities in your
Portfolio or in the underlying funds will fluctuate. This could cause the value 
of your Units to fall below your original purchase price. Market value          
fluctuates in response to various factors. These can include changes in interest
rates, inflation, the financial condition of a security's issuer, perceptions of
the issuer, or ratings on a security. Even though your Portfolio is supervised, 
you should remember that we do not manage your Portfolio. Your Portfolio will   
not sell a security solely because the market value falls as is possible in a   
managed fund.                                                                   

  Dividend Payment Risk. Dividend payment risk is the risk that an issuer of a
security is unwilling or unable to pay income on a security. Stocks represent   
ownership interests in the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.      
Common stockholders have a right to receive dividends only after the company has
provided for payment of its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when     
declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may   
vary over time.                                                                 

Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk is the risk that the value of      
securities held by a closed-end fund will fall if interest rates increase. The  
securities held by the closed-end funds typically fall in value when interest   
rates rise and rise in value when interest rates fall. The securities held by   
the closed-end funds with longer periods before maturity are often more         
sensitive to interest rate changes.                                             

Credit Risk. Credit risk is the risk that a borrower is unable to meet its
obligation to pay principal or interest on a security held by a closed-end fund.
This may reduce the level of dividends a closed-end fund pays which would reduce
your income and could cause the value of your Units to fall.                    

Closed-End Funds. Each Portfolio invests in shares of closed-end funds. You
should understand the section titled "Closed-End Funds" before you invest.      
Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net asset  
value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the risk 
that the net asset value of fund shares may decrease. The amount of such        
discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in response
to various factors. Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including    
management's ability to meet the fund's investment objective, and to manage the 
fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold, during      
periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions regarding closed-end    
funds or their underlying investments change. The Portfolios and the underlying 
funds have operating expenses. You will bear not only your share of your        
Portfolio's expenses, but also the expenses of the underlying funds. By         
investing in other funds, your Portfolio incurs greater expenses than you would 
incur if you invested directly in the funds.                                    

   Municipal Bond Risks. Each of the closed-end funds held by the Cohen & Steers
Master Municipal Income Portfolio - National Series invests in tax-exempt       
municipal bonds. Municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or by    
political subdivisions or authorities of states. Municipal bonds are typically  
designated as general obligation bonds, which are general obligations of a      
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity, or      
revenue bonds, which are payable from the income of a specific project or       
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. Municipal  
bonds are long-term fixed rate debt obligations that generally decline in value 
with increases in interest rates, when an issuer's financial condition worsens  
or when the rating on a bond is decreased. Many municipal bonds may be called or
redeemed prior to their stated maturity, an event which is more likely to occur 
when interest rates fall. In such an occurrence, a closed-end fund may not be   
able to reinvest the money it receives in other bonds that have as high a yield 
or as long a maturity.                                                          

  Many municipal bonds are subject to continuing requirements as to the actual
use of the bond proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from    
bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from      
federal income taxation. The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid
than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more
volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater 
liquidity. In addition, an issuer's ability to make income distributions        
generally depends on several factors including the financial condition of the   
issuer and general economic conditions. Any of these factors may negatively     
impact the price of municipal bonds held by a closed-end fund and would         
therefore impact the price of both the fund shares and the Units.               

The funds invest primarily in municipal bonds that pay interest that is   
exempt from regular federal income tax and, for state-specific funds, from      
regular income tax of the applicable state. Notwithstanding the foregoing,      
certain income from a fund may not qualify as tax-exempt income and could be    
subject to federal, state or local tax. In addition, income from the funds may  
be subject to the alternative minimum tax and may have other tax consequences   
(e.g., they may affect the amount of social security benefits that are taxed).  
Capital gains and capital gain dividends, if any, will be subject to tax.       

Senior Loans. The closed-end funds held by the Senior Loan and Limited  
Duration Portfolio may invest in senior loans. Senior loans are issued by banks,
other financial institutions and other investors to corporations, partnerships, 
limited liability companies and other entities to finance leveraged buyouts,    
recapitalizations, mergers, acquisitions, stock repurchases, debt refinancings  
and, to a lesser extent, for general operating and other purposes. Further      
information about senior loans appears in the following section entitled "Senior
Loan Investments."                                                              

    An investment by the closed-end funds in senior loans involves risk that the
borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal  
or interest when due. Although senior loans may be secured by specific          
collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would      
satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-payment or that such      
collateral could be readily liquidated. Senior loans are typically structured as
floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation  
fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on closed-end     
funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest    
rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment. Senior     
loans are generally below investment grade quality and may be unrated at the    
time of investment; are generally not registered with the SEC or state          
securities commissions; and are generally not listed on any securities exchange.
In addition, the amount of public information available on senior loans is      
generally less extensive than that available for other types of securities.     

High-Yield Security Risk. Certain of the closed-end funds held by the   
Portfolios may invest in high-yield securities or unrated securities.           
High-yield, high risk securities are subject to greater market fluctuations and 
risk of loss than securities with higher investment ratings. The value of these 
securities will decline significantly with increases in interest rates, not only
because increases in rates generally decrease values, but also because increased
rates may indicate an economic slowdown. An economic slowdown, or a reduction in
an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the issuer being unable to maintain 
earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments.     

High-yield or "junk" securities, the generic names for securities rated 
below "BBB" by Standard & Poor's or "Baa" by Moody's, are frequently issued by  
corporations in the growth stage of their development or by established         
companies who are highly leveraged or whose operations or industries are        
depressed. Securities rated below BBB or Baa are considered speculative as these
ratings indicate a quality of less than investment grade. Because high-yield    
securities are generally subordinated obligations and are perceived by investors
to be riskier than higher rated securities, their prices tend to fluctuate more 
than higher rated securities and are affected by short-term credit developments 
to a greater degree.                                                            

 The market for high-yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that
for investment grade securities. High-yield securities are generally not listed 
on a national securities exchange but trade in the over-the-counter markets. Due
to the smaller, less liquid market for high-yield securities, the bid-offer     
spread on such securities is generally greater than it is for investment grade  
securities and the purchase or sale of such securities may take longer to       
complete.                                                                       

 Foreign Issuer Risk. Some of the underlying securities held by certain of
the closed-end funds in your Portfolio may be issued by foreign issuers. This   
subjects your Portfolio to more risks than if it only invested in closed-end    
funds which invest solely in securities of domestic issuers. Risks of foreign   
issuers include restrictions on foreign investments and exchange of securities  
and inadequate financial information. Foreign securities may also be affected by
market and political factors specific to the issuer's country as well as        
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Risks associated with investing
in foreign securities may be more pronounced in emerging markets where the      
securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, less liquid, less 
regulated, and more volatile than the securities markets of the U.S. and        
developed foreign markets. Investments in debt securities of foreign governments
present special risks, including the fact that issuers may be unable or         
unwilling to repay principal and/or interest when due in accordance with the    
terms of such debt, or may be unable to make such repayments when due in the    
currency required under the terms of the debt. Political, economic and social   
events also may have a greater impact on the price of debt securities issued by 
foreign governments than on the price of U.S. securities. In addition, brokerage
and other transaction costs on foreign securities exchanges are often higher    
than in the United States and there is generally less government supervision and
regulation of exchanges, brokers and issuers in foreign countries.              

    Liquidity Risk. Liquidity risk is the risk that the value of a security will
fall if trading in the security is limited or absent. No one can guarantee that 
a liquid trading market will exist for any security.                            

No FDIC Guarantee. An investment in your Portfolio is not a deposit of any
bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance          
Corporation or any other government agency.                                     

SENIOR LOAN INVESTMENTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Senior Loan and Limited Duration Portfolio invests significantly in 
closed-end funds that invest in secured senior loans to corporations,           
partnerships and other business entities. These loans are backed by a company's 
assets and have a senior position in a company's capital structure, ahead of    
other types of debt securities, as well as preferred and common stock.          
Additionally, the interest rates on senior loans generally float over published 
interest rate indices which can move up or down with market rate movements.     

    Senior secured loans generally hold the most senior position in a borrower's
capital structure and are typically backed by assets such as inventory,         
receivables, real estate property, buildings. These assets can also include     
intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, and even the stock of other
companies or subsidiaries. In addition, while secured creditors generally       
receive greater protection in insolvency situations, there is no assurance that 
collateral will be sufficient to repay interest and/or principal in such        
situations.                                                                     

  Secured senior loans have historically paid a higher rate of interest than
most short-term investments. The underlying loan rates "float" above indices    
such as the prime rate offered by one or more major banks, the London Inter-Bank
Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), or the certificate of deposit rate or other base lending
rates used by commercial lenders. As a result, the interest rates realized by   
the closed-end funds held by the Portfolio will generally adjust up or down with
changes in interest rates. Since secured senior loans generally have floating   
interest rates, they are typically not as sensitive as fixed-income investments 
to price fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. Of course, there is no  
guarantee that this will occur in the future.                                   

CLOSED-END FUNDS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Closed-end funds are a type of investment company that hold an actively 
managed portfolio of securities. Closed-end funds issue shares in "closed-end"  
offerings which generally trade on a stock exchange (although some closed-end   
fund shares are not listed on a securities exchange). The funds in the          
Portfolios all are currently listed on a securities exchange. Since closed-end  
funds maintain a relatively fixed pool of investment capital, portfolio managers
may be better able to adhere to their investment philosophies through greater   
flexibility and control. In addition, closed-end funds don't have to manage fund
liquidity to meet potentially large redemptions.                                

Closed-end funds are subject to various risks, including management's   
ability to meet the closed-end fund's investment objective, and to manage the   
closed-end fund portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold,  
during periods of market turmoil and as investors' perceptions regarding        
closed-end funds or their underlying investments change.                        

Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a discount from their net
asset value in the secondary market. This risk is separate and distinct from the
risk that the net asset value of closed-end fund shares may decrease. The amount
of such discount from net asset value is subject to change from time to time in 
response to various factors.                                                    

The closed-end funds included in the Portfolios may employ the use of   
leverage in their portfolios through the issuance of preferred stock or other   
methods. While leverage often serves to increase the yield of a closed-end fund,
this leverage also subjects the closed-end fund to increased risks. These risks 
may include the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the 
closed-end fund's common share income will fall if the dividend rate on the     
preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises.                  

Certain of the funds in the Portfolios may be classified as             
"non-diversified" under the Investment Company Act of 1940. These funds have the
ability to invest more than 5% of their assets in securities of a single issuer 
which could reduce diversification.                                             

Only the Trustee may vote the shares of the closed-end funds held in the
Portfolios. The Trustee will vote the shares in the same general proportion as  
shares held by other shareholders of each fund. Your Portfolio is generally     
required, however, to reject any offer for securities or other property in      
exchange for portfolio securities as described under "Portfolio
Administration--Portfolio Administration."

PUBLIC OFFERING 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General. Units are offered at the Public Offering Price which includes the
net assets value per Unit plus organization costs plus the sales charge. The net
asset value per Unit is the value of the securities, cash and other assets in   
your Portfolio reduced by the liabilities of the Portfolio divided by the total 
Units outstanding. The maximum sales charge equals 3.00% of the Public Offering 
Price per Unit at the time of purchase.                                         

   You pay the initial sales charge at the time you buy Units. The initial sales
charge is the difference between the total sales charge percentage (maximum of  
3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit) and the sum of the remaining fixed 
dollar deferred sales charge and the total fixed dollar creation and development
fee. The initial sales charge will be approximately 1.00% of the Public Offering
Price per Unit depending on the Public Offering Price per Unit. The deferred    
sales charge is fixed at $0.150 per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the deferred sales
charge in installments as described in the "Fee Table." If any deferred sales   
charge payment date is not a business day, we will charge the payment on the    
next business day. If you purchase Units after the initial deferred sales charge
payment, you will only pay that portion of the payments not yet collected. If   
you redeem or sell your Units prior to collection of the total deferred sales   
charge, you will pay any remaining deferred sales charge upon redemption or sale
of your Units. The initial and deferred sales charges are referred to as the    
"transactional sales charge." The transactional sales charge does not include   
the creation and development fee which compensates the Sponsor for creating and 
developing your Portfolio and is described under "Expenses." The creation and   
development fee is fixed at $0.05 per Unit. Your Portfolio pays the creation and
development fee as the close of the initial offering period as described in the 
"Fee Table." If you redeem or sell your Units prior to collection of the        
creation and development fee, you will not pay the creation and development fee 
upon redemption or sale of your Units. Because the deferred sales charge and    
creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit, the actual      
charges will exceed the percentages shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public      
Offering Price per Unit falls below $10 and will be less than the percentages   
shown in the "Fee Table" if the Public Offering Price per Unit exceeds $10. In  
no event will the maximum total sales charge exceed 3.00% of the Public Offering
Price per Unit.                                                                 

Since the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed
dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit      
regardless of any decrease in net asset value. However, if the Public Offering  
Price per Unit falls to the extent that the maximum sales charge percentage     
results in a dollar amount that is less than the combined fixed dollar amounts  
of the deferred sales charge and creation and development fee, your initial     
sales charge will be a credit equal to the amount by which these fixed dollar   
charges exceed your sales charge at the time you buy Units. In such a situation,
the value of securities per Unit would exceed the Public Offering Price per Unit
by the amount of the initial sales charge credit and the value of those         
securities will fluctuate, which could result in a benefit or detriment to      
Unitholders that purchase Units at that price. The initial sales charge credit  
is paid by the Sponsor and is not paid by your Portfolio. The "Fee Table" shows 
the sales charge calculation at a $10 Public Offering Price per Unit and the    
following examples illustrate the sales charge at prices below and above $10. If
the Public Offering Price per Unit fell to $6, the maximum sales charge would be
$0.1800 (3.00% of the Public Offering Price per Unit), which consists of an     
initial sales charge of -$0.0200, a deferred sales charge of $0.150 and a       
creation and development fee of $0.05. If the Public Offering Price per Unit    
rose to $14, the maximum sales charge would be $0.4200 (3.00% of the Public     
Offering Price per Unit), consisting of an initial sales charge of $0.2200, a   
deferred sales charge of $0.150 and the creation and development fee of $0.05.  

  Beginning on April 12, 2008, the secondary market sales charge will be 2.50%
and will not include deferred payments. This sales charge will reduce by 0.50%  
on each subsequent April 12 to a minimum of 1.00%. The actual sales charge that 
may be paid by an investor may differ slightly from the sales charges shown     
herein due to rounding that occurs in the calculation of the Public Offering    
Price and in the number of Units purchased.                                     

  The minimum purchase is 100 Units (25 Units for retirement accounts) but may
vary by selling firm. Certain broker-dealers or selling firms may charge an     
order handling fee for processing Unit purchases.                               

Reducing Your Sales Charge. The Sponsor offers a variety of ways for you to
reduce the sales charge that you pay. It is your financial professional's       
responsibility to alert the Sponsor of any discount when you purchase Units.    
Before you purchase Units you must also inform your financial professional of   
your qualification for any discount or of any combined purchases to be eligible 
for a reduced sales charge. You may not combine discounts. Since the deferred   
sales charge and creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per Unit,
your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit regardless of any discounts.  
However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales   
charge is less than the fixed dollar amounts of the deferred sales charge and   
creation and development fee, you will receive a credit equal to the difference 
between your total sales charge and these fixed dollar charges at the time you  
buy Units.                                                                      

  Large Quantity Purchases. You can reduce your sales charge by increasing the
size of your investment. If you purchase the amount of Units shown in the table 
below during the initial offering period, the sales charge will be as follows:  

Transaction                                                       
Amount                             Sales Charge               
--------------                        --------------                  
Less than $100,000                              3.00%                           
$100,000 - $249,999                             2.80                            
$250,000 - $499,999                             2.70                            
$500,000 - $999,999                             2.60                            
$1,000,000 or more                              2.40                            

Except as described below, these quantity discount levels apply only to   
purchases of a single Portfolio made by the same person on a single day from a  
single broker-dealer. We apply these sales charges as a percent of the Public   
Offering Price per Unit at the time of purchase. We also apply the different    
purchase levels on a Unit basis using a $10 Unit equivalent. For example, if you
purchase between 10,000 and 24,999 Units, your sales charge will be 2.80% of    
your Public Offering Price per Unit. These sales charge discounts are applied to
the first year sales charge only and do not affect the second year deferred     
sales charge.                                                                   

  For purposes of achieving these levels you may combine purchases of Units of
a Portfolio offered in this prospectus with purchases of units of any other Van 
Kampen-sponsored unit investment trust in the initial offering period. In       
addition, Units purchased in the name of your spouse or children under 21 living
in the same household as you will be deemed to be additional purchases by you   
for the purposes of calculating the applicable quantity discount level. The     
reduced sales charge levels will also be applicable to a trustee or other       
fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust, estate (including multiple trusts
created under a single estate) or fiduciary account. To be eligible for         
aggregation as described in this paragraph, all purchases must be made on the   
same day through a single broker-dealer or selling agent. You must inform your  
broker-dealer of any combined purchases before your purchase to be eligible for 
a reduced sales charge.                                                         

Fee Accounts. Investors may purchase Units through registered investment  
advisers, certified financial planners and registered broker-dealers who in each
case either charge periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning,    
investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in   
connection with the establishment of an investment account for which a          
comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed ("Fee Accounts"). If    
Units of a Portfolio are purchased for a Fee Account and the Portfolio is       
subject to a Wrap Fee (i.e., the Portfolio is "Wrap Fee Eligible"), then the    
purchase will not be subject to the transactional sales charge but will be      
subject to the creation and development fee that is retained by the Sponsor.    
Please refer to the section called "Fee Accounts" for additional information on 
these purchases. The Sponsor reserves the right to limit or deny purchases of   
Units described in this paragraph by investors or selling firms whose frequent  
trading activity is determined to be detrimental to a Portfolio.                

  Exchanges. During the initial offering period of a Portfolio offered in this
prospectus, unitholders of any Van Kampen-sponsored unit investment trusts and  
unitholders of unaffiliated unit investment trusts may utilize their redemption 
or termination proceeds from such a trust to purchase Units of a Portfolio      
offered in this prospectus at the Public Offering Price per Unit less 1.00%. In 
order to be eligible for the sales charge discounts applicable to Unit purchases
made with redemption or termination proceeds from other unit investment trusts, 
the termination or redemption proceeds used to purchase Units of a Portfolio    
must be derived from a transaction that occurred within 30 days of your Unit    
purchase. In addition, the discounts will only be available for investors that  
utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer with appropriate   
notification) for both the Unit purchase and the transaction resulting in the   
receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the Unit purchase.   
You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or other information to
your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for these reduced sales charge  
discounts.                                                                      

Employees. Employees, officers and directors (including their spouses and 
children under 21 living in the same household, and trustees, custodians or     
fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons) of Van Kampen Funds Inc. and its   
affiliates, and dealers and their affiliates may purchase Units at the Public   
Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. All employee discounts are
subject to the policies of the related selling firm. Only employees, officers   
and directors of companies that allow their employees to participate in this    
employee discount program are eligible for the discounts.                       

Distribution Reinvestments. We do not charge any sales charge when you    
reinvest distributions from your Portfolio into additional Units of your        
Portfolio. Since the deferred sales charges and creation and development fee are
fixed dollar amounts per Unit, your Portfolio must charge these amounts per Unit
regardless of this discount. If you elect to reinvest distributions, the Sponsor
will credit you with additional Units with a dollar value sufficient to cover   
the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge and creation and development  
fee that will be collected on such Units at the time of reinvestment. The dollar
value of these Units will fluctuate over time.                                  

Unit Price. The Public Offering Price of Units will vary from the amounts 
stated under "Essential Information" in accordance with fluctuations in the     
prices of the underlying Securities in your Portfolio. The initial price of the 
Securities was determined by the Trustee. The Trustee will generally determine  
the value of the Securities as of the Evaluation Time on each business day and  
will adjust the Public Offering Price of Units accordingly. The Evaluation Time 
is the close of the New York Stock Exchange on each business day. The term      
"business day", as used herein and under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units", excludes Saturdays, Sundays and holidays observed by the New York Stock 
Exchange. The Public Offering Price per Unit will be effective for all orders   
received prior to the Evaluation Time on each business day. Orders received by  
the Sponsor prior to the Evaluation Time and orders received by authorized      
financial professionals prior to the Evaluation Time that are properly          
transmitted to the Sponsor by the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced    
based on the date of receipt. Orders received by the Sponsor after the          
Evaluation Time, and orders received by authorized financial professionals after
the Evaluation Time or orders received by such persons that are not transmitted 
to the Sponsor until after the time designated by the Sponsor, are priced based 
on the date of the next determined Public Offering Price per Unit provided they 
are received timely by the Sponsor on such date. It is the responsibility of    
authorized financial professionals to transmit orders received by them to the   
Sponsor so they will be received in a timely manner.                            

The value of portfolio securities is based on the securities' market price
when available. When a market price is not readily available, including         
circumstances under which the Trustee determines that a security's market price 
is not accurate, a portfolio security is valued at its fair value, as determined
under procedures established by the Trustee or an independent pricing service   
used by the Trustee. In these cases, a Portfolio's net asset value will reflect 
certain portfolio securities' fair value rather than their market price. With   
respect to securities that are primarily listed on foreign exchanges, the value 
of the portfolio securities may change on days when you will not be able to     
purchase or sell Units. The value of any foreign securities is based on the     
applicable currency exchange rate as of the Evaluation Time. The Sponsor will   
provide price dissemination and oversight services to your Portfolio.           

During the initial offering period, part of the Public Offering Price     
represents an amount that will pay the costs incurred in establishing your      
Portfolio. These costs include the costs of preparing documents relating to the 
Portfolio (such as the registration statement, prospectus, trust agreement and  
legal documents), federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and     
expenses of the Trustee and the initial audit. Your Portfolio will sell         
securities to reimburse us for these costs at the end of the initial offering   
period or after six months, if earlier. The value of your Units will decline    
when your Portfolio pays these costs.                                           

Unit Distribution. Units will be distributed to the public by the Sponsor,
broker-dealers and others at the Public Offering Price. Units repurchased in the
secondary market, if any, may be offered by this prospectus at the secondary    
market Public Offering Price in the manner described above.                     

   The Sponsor intends to qualify Units for sale in a number of states. Brokers,
dealers and others will be allowed a regular concession or agency commission in 
connection with the distribution of Units during the initial offering period as 
described in the following table:                                               

Transaction                                                       
Amount*                                                       
--------------                                                        
Less than $100,000                               2.25%

$250,000 - $499,999                              2.00                           
$500,000 - $999,999                              1.95                           
$1,000,000 or more                               1.80                           

---------------                                                                 
*  The breakpoint concessions or agency commissions are also applied on a Unit
basis using a breakpoint equivalent of $10 per Unit and are applied on  
whichever basis is more favorable to the distributor.                   

For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts who
use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase Units of the           
Portfolios, this regular concession or agency commission will amount to 1.30%   
per Unit.                                                                       

 In addition to the regular concession or agency commission set forth above,
all broker-dealers and other selling firms will be eligible to receive          
additional compensation based on total initial offering period sales of all     
eligible Van Kampen unit investment trusts during a Quarterly Period as set     
forth in the following table:                                                   

Initial Offering Period                       Volume                          
Sales During Quarterly Period               Concession                          
------------------------------             ------------                         
$2 million but less than $5 million            0.025%                           
$5 million but less than $10 million           0.050                            
$10 million but less than $50 million          0.075                            
$50 million or more                            0.100                            

  "Quarterly Period" means the following periods: December - February; March -
May; June - August; and September - November. Broker-dealers and other selling  
firms will not receive these additional volume concessions on the sale of units 
which are not subject to the transactional sales charge, however, such sales    
will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level          
breakpoints set forth in the table above. Secondary market sales of all unit    
investment trusts are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions.        
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Wachovia Securities, LLC will receive the maximum
volume concession set forth in the table above for all eligible unit sales. The 
Sponsor will pay these amounts out of the transactional sales charge received on
units within a reasonable time following each Quarterly Period. For a trust to  
be eligible for this additional compensation for Quarterly Period sales, the    
trust's prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional           
compensation; a trust is not eligible for this additional compensation if the   
prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this additional
compensation.                                                                   

Except as provided in this section, any sales charge discount provided to 
investors will be borne by the selling broker-dealer or agent. For all secondary
market transactions the total concession or agency commission will amount to 80%
of the sales charge. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no case
shall the total of any concessions, agency commissions and any additional       
compensation allowed or paid to any broker, dealer or other distributor of Units
with respect to any individual transaction exceed the total sales charge        
applicable to such transaction. The Sponsor reserves the right to reject, in    
whole or in part, any order for the purchase of Units and to change the amount  
of the concession or agency commission to dealers and others from time to time. 

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional 
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell Units of these Portfolios  
and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in additional   
sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors   
for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the Portfolios and our other products. Fees may 
include payment for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred in connection  
with trips taken by invited registered representatives for meetings or seminars 
of a business nature. These arrangements will not change the price you pay for  
your Units.                                                                     

Sponsor Compensation. The Sponsor will receive the total sales charge     
applicable to each transaction. Except as provided under "Unit Distribution"    
above, any sales charge discount provided to investors will be borne by the     
selling dealer or agent. In addition, the Sponsor will realize a profit or loss 
as a result of the difference between the price paid for the Securities by the  
Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to a Portfolio on the Initial Date of    
Deposit as well as on subsequent deposits. See "Notes to Portfolios". The       
Supervisor, which is an affiliate of the Sponsor, acts as investment advisor to 
the Van Kampen Senior Income Trust, one of the Senior Loan and Limited Duration 
Portfolio's underlying funds, and will receive compensation in this capacity.   
The Sponsor has not participated as sole underwriter or as manager or as a      
member of the underwriting syndicates or as an agent in a private placement for 
any of the Securities, except that an affiliate of the Sponsor served as an     
underwriter in the initial public offering of common stock of the Van Kampen    
Senior Income Trust. The Sponsor may realize profit or loss as a result of      
fluctuations in the market value of Units held by the Sponsor for sale to the   
public. In maintaining a secondary market, the Sponsor will realize profits or  
losses in the amount of any difference between the price at which Units are     
purchased and the price at which Units are resold (which price includes the     
applicable sales charge) or from a redemption of repurchased Units at a price   
above or below the purchase price. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor  
prior to the date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the    
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor, subject to 
the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.                         

   The Sponsor or an affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one
or more of the Securities. The Sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have
a long or short position in these Securities or related securities. An affiliate
may act as a specialist or market maker for these Securities. An officer,       
director or employee of the Sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for issuers of the Securities.                                         

Market for Units. Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor may  
maintain a market for Units and to purchase Units at the secondary market       
repurchase price (which is described under "Right of Unitholders--Redemption of
Units"). The Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units or discontinue purchases
at this price at any time. In the event that a secondary market is not          
maintained, a Unitholder will be able to dispose of Units by tendering them to  
the Trustee for redemption at the Redemption Price. See "Rights of
Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders should contact their broker to   
determine the best price for Units in the secondary market. Units sold prior to 
the time the entire deferred sales charge has been collected will be assessed   
the amount of any remaining deferred sales charge at the time of sale. The      
Trustee will notify the Sponsor of any Units tendered for redemption. If the    
Sponsor's bid in the secondary market equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per
Unit, it may purchase the Units not later than the day on which Units would have
been redeemed by the Trustee. The Sponsor may sell repurchased Units at the     
secondary market Public Offering Price per Unit.                                

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Units are available for purchase in connection with certain types of      
tax-sheltered retirement plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts for    
individuals, Simplified Employee Pension Plans for employees, qualified plans   
for self-employed individuals, and qualified corporate pension and profit       
sharing plans for employees. The minimum purchase for these accounts is reduced 
to 25 Units but may vary by selling firm. The purchase of Units may be limited  
by the plans' provisions and does not itself establish such plans.              

FEE ACCOUNTS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As described above, Units may be available for purchase by investors in Fee
Accounts where the Portfolio is Wrap Fee Eligible. You should consult your      
financial professional to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts.
This table illustrates the sales charge you will pay if the Portfolio is Wrap   
Fee Eligible as a percentage of the initial Public Offering Price per Unit on   
the Initial Date of Deposit (the percentage will vary thereafter).              

Initial sales charge                       0.00%                          
Deferred sales charge                      0.00                           
              ------
Transactional sales charge           0.00%                    
              ======
Creation and development fee               0.50%                          
              ------
Total sales charge                   0.50%                    
              ======

  You should consult the "Public Offering--Reducing Your Sales Charge" section
for specific information on this and other sales charge discounts. That section 
governs the calculation of all sales charge discounts. The Sponsor reserves the 
right to limit or deny purchases of Units in Fee Accounts by investors or       
selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be detrimental to
a Portfolio.                                                                    

RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributions. With respect to the Senior Loan and Limited Duration       
Portfolio, the Cohen & Steers Master Equity and Income Portfolio and the Cohen &
Steers Master Income Portfolio, dividends (pro rated on an annual basis), net of
expenses, and any net proceeds from the sale of Securities received by a        
Portfolio will generally be distributed to Unitholders on each Distribution Date
to Unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date. With respect to the Cohen
& Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio - National Series, the Trustee will  
generally distribute the cash held in the Income and Capital Accounts of your   
Portfolio, net of expenses, on each Distribution Date to Unitholders of record  
on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution
equals at least 0.1% of your Portfolio's net asset value. These dates appear    
under "Essential Information". In addition, a Portfolio will generally make     
required distributions at the end of each year if it is structured as a         
"regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes. Unitholders will also  
receive a final distribution of dividends when their Portfolio terminates. A    
person becomes a Unitholder of record on the date of settlement (generally three
business days after Units are ordered). Unitholders may elect to receive        
distributions in cash or to have distributions reinvested into additional Units.
Distributions may also be reinvested into Van Kampen mutual funds. See "Rights
of Unitholders--Reinvestment Option".                                           

 Dividends received by a Portfolio are credited to the Income Account of the
Portfolio. Other receipts (e.g., capital gains, proceeds from the sale of       
Securities, etc.) are credited to the Capital Account. Proceeds received on the 
sale of any Securities, to the extent not used to meet redemptions of Units or  
pay deferred sales charges, fees or expenses, will be distributed to            
Unitholders. Proceeds received from the disposition of any Securities after a   
Record Date and prior to the following Distribution Date will be held in the    
Capital Account and not distributed until the next Distribution Date.           

The income distribution to the Unitholders of the Cohen & Steers Master   
Equity and Income Portfolio and the Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio as of
each Record Date will be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly     
thereafter and shall consist of an amount substantially equal to one-twelfth of 
the estimated net annual income in the Income Account. Because income payments  
are not received by a Portfolio at a constant rate throughout the year, such    
distributions to Unitholders may be more or less than the amount credited to the
Income Account as of the Record Date. For the purpose of minimizing fluctuation 
in the distributions from the Income Account, the Trustee is authorized to      
advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of     
approximately equal amounts. The Trustee shall be reimbursed, without interest, 
for any such advances from funds in the Income Account on the ensuing Record    
Date.                                                                           

Estimated Distributions. The estimated initial distribution and estimated net
annual income per Unit may be shown under "Essential Information." The estimate 
of the income a Portfolio may receive is based on the most recent ordinary      
dividends declared by a closed-end fund. The actual net annual distributions are
expected to decrease over time because a portion of the Securities included in a
Portfolio will be sold to pay for organization costs, deferred sales charge and 
creation and development fee. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees   
and expenses during a Portfolio's life. The actual net annual income            
distributions you receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in 
a Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by a Portfolio,      
currency fluctuations and with changes in a Portfolio such as the acquisition,  
call, maturity or sale of Securities. Due to these and various other factors,   
actual income received by a Portfolio will most likely differ from the most     
recent dividends or scheduled income payments.                                  

Reinvestment Option. Unitholders may have distributions automatically     
reinvested in additional Units without a sales charge (to the extent Units may  
be lawfully offered for sale in the state in which the Unitholder resides)      
through two options. The CUSIP numbers are set forth under "Essential           
Information". Brokers and dealers can use the Dividend Reinvestment Service     
through Depository Trust Company or purchase a Reinvest CUSIP, if available. To 
participate in this reinvestment option, a Unitholder must file with the Trustee
a written notice of election, together with any certificate representing Units  
and other documentation that the Trustee may then require, at least five days   
prior to the related Record Date. A Unitholder's election will apply to all     
Units owned by the Unitholder and will remain in effect until changed by the    
Unitholder. If Units are unavailable for reinvestment, distributions will be    
paid in cash.                                                                   

In addition, under the Planned Reinvestment Option (PRO) Unitholders may  
elect to have distributions automatically reinvested in certain Van Kampen      
mutual funds (the "Reinvestment Funds"). Each Reinvestment Fund has investment  
objectives which differ from those of your Portfolio. The prospectus relating to
each Reinvestment Fund describes its investment policies and how to begin       
reinvestment. A Unitholder may obtain a prospectus for the Reinvestment Funds   
from the Sponsor. Purchases of shares of a Reinvestment Fund will be made at a  
net asset value computed on the Distribution Date. Unitholders with an existing 
PRO account (whereby a sales charge is imposed on distribution reinvestments)   
may transfer their existing account into a new account which allows purchases of
Reinvestment Fund shares at net asset value.                                    

   A participant may elect to terminate his or her reinvestment plan and receive
future distributions in cash by notifying the Trustee in writing no later than  
five days before a Distribution Date. The Sponsor, each Reinvestment Fund, and  
its investment adviser shall have the right to suspend or terminate these       
reinvestment plans at any time. Each reinvestment plan is subject to            
availability or limitation by each broker-dealer or selling firm. Broker-dealers
may suspend or terminate the offering of a reinvestment plan at any time. Please
contact your financial professional for additional information.                 

Redemption of Units. A Unitholder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by
tender to the Trustee at Unit Investment Trust Division, 101 Barclay Street,    
20th Floor, New York, New York 10286. Certificates must be tendered to the      
Trustee, duly endorsed or accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with    
signature guaranteed (or by providing satisfactory indemnity in connection with 
lost, stolen or destroyed certificates) and by payment of applicable            
governmental charges, if any. No later than the seventh day following the       
tender, the Unitholder will be entitled to receive in cash an amount for each   
Unit equal to the Redemption Price per Unit next computed on the date of tender.
The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on which Units are received by the
Trustee, except that with respect to Units received by the Trustee after the    
Evaluation Time or on a day which is not a Portfolio business day, the date of  
tender is deemed to be the next business day. Redemption requests received by   
the Trustee after the Evaluation Time, and redemption requests received by      
authorized financial professionals after the Evaluation Time or redemption      
requests received by such persons that are not transmitted to the Trustee until 
after the time designated by the Trustee, are priced based on the date of the   
next determined redemption price provided they are received timely by the       
Trustee on such date. It is the responsibility of authorized financial          
professionals to transmit redemption requests received by them to the Trustee so
they will be received in a timely manner. Certain broker-dealers or selling     
firms may charge an order handling fee for processing redemption requests. Units
redeemed directly through the Trustee are not subject to such fees.             

 Unitholders tendering 1,000 or more Units of the Portfolios (or such higher
amount as may be required by your broker-dealer or selling agent) for redemption
may request an in kind distribution of Securities equal to the Redemption Price 
per Unit on the date of tender. Unitholders may not request an in kind          
distribution of Securities within thirty days of a Portfolio's termination. The 
Portfolios generally do not offer in kind distributions of portfolio securities 
that are held in foreign markets. An in kind distribution will be made by the   
Trustee through the distribution of each of the Securities in book-entry form to
the account of the Unitholder's broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company.      
Amounts representing fractional shares will be distributed in cash. The Trustee 
may adjust the number of shares of any Security included in a Unitholder's in   
kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole shares. The in-kind   
distribution option may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice. 

The Trustee may sell Securities to satisfy Unit redemptions. To the extent
that Securities are redeemed in kind or sold, the size of a Portfolio will be,  
and the diversity of the Portfolio may be, reduced. Sales may be required at a  
time when Securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized. The price received upon redemption may be more
or less than the amount paid by the Unitholder depending on the value of the    
Securities at the time of redemption. Special federal income tax consequences   
will result if a Unitholder requests an in kind distribution. See "Taxation".   

 The Redemption Price per Unit and the secondary market repurchase price per
Unit are equal to the pro rata share of each Unit in your Portfolio determined  
on the basis of (i) the cash on hand in the Portfolio, (ii) the value of the    
Securities in the Portfolio and (iii) dividends receivable on the Securities in 
the Portfolio trading ex-dividend as of the date of computation, less (a)       
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of the     
Portfolio, (b) the accrued expenses of the Portfolio and (c) any unpaid deferred
sales charge payments. During the initial offering period, the redemption price 
and the secondary market repurchase price will not be reduced by estimated      
organization costs or the creation and development fee. For these purposes, the 
Trustee may determine the value of the Securities in the following manner: If   
the Securities are listed on a national or foreign securities exchange or the   
Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., this evaluation is generally based on the closing    
sale prices on that exchange or market (unless it is determined that these      
prices are inappropriate as a basis for valuation) or, if there is no closing   
sale price on that exchange or market, at the closing bid prices. If the        
Securities are not so listed or, if so listed and the principal market therefor 
is other than on the exchange or market, the evaluation may be based on the     
current bid price on the over-the-counter market. If current bid prices are     
unavailable or inappropriate, the evaluation may be determined (a) on the basis 
of current bid prices for comparable securities, (b) by appraising the          
Securities on the bid side of the market or (c) by any combination of the above.
The value of any foreign securities is based on the applicable currency exchange
rate as of the Evaluation Time.                                                 

   The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any period
during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than for customary    
weekend and holiday closings, or any period during which the SEC determines that
trading on that Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of   
which disposal or evaluation of the Securities is not reasonably practicable, or
for other periods as the SEC may permit.                                        

Exchange Option. When you redeem Units of your Portfolio or when your     
Portfolio terminates, you may be able to exchange your Units for units of other 
Van Kampen unit trusts at a reduced sales charge. You should contact your       
financial professional for more information about trusts currently available for
exchanges. Before you exchange Units, you should read the prospectus of the new 
trust carefully and understand the risks and fees. You should then discuss this 
option with your financial professional to determine whether your investment    
goals have changed, whether current trusts suit you and to discuss tax          
consequences. We may discontinue this option at any time.                       

   Units. Ownership of Units is evidenced in book-entry form unless a Unitholder
makes a written request to the Trustee that ownership be in certificate form.   
Units are transferable by making a written request to the Trustee and, in the   
case of Units in certificate form, by presentation of the certificate to the    
Trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments 
of transfer. A Unitholder must sign the written request, and certificate or     
transfer instrument, exactly as his name appears on the records of the Trustee  
and on the face of any certificate with the signature guaranteed by a           
participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program ("STAMP") or a  
signature guarantee program accepted by the Trustee. In certain instances the   
Trustee may require additional documents such as, but not limited to, trust     
instruments, certificates of death, appointments as executor or administrator or
certificates of corporate authority. Fractional certificates will not be issued.
The Trustee may require a Unitholder to pay a reasonable fee for each           
certificate reissued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may 
be imposed in connection with each transfer or interchange. Destroyed, stolen,  
mutilated or lost certificates will be replaced upon delivery to the Trustee of 
satisfactory indemnity, evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred. 
Mutilated certificates must be surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.      

   Reports Provided. Unitholders will receive a statement of dividends and other
amounts received by a Portfolio for each distribution. Within a reasonable time 
after the end of each year, each person who was a Unitholder during that year   
will receive a statement describing dividends and capital received, actual      
Portfolio distributions, Portfolio expenses, a list of the Securities and other 
Portfolio information. Unitholders may obtain evaluations of the Securities upon
request to the Trustee. If you have questions regarding your account or your    
Portfolio, please contact your financial advisor or the Trustee. The Sponsor    
does not have access to individual account information.                         

PORTFOLIO ADMINISTRATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Administration. Your Portfolio is not a managed fund and, except as
provided in the Trust Agreement, Securities generally will not be sold or       
replaced. The Sponsor may, however, direct that Securities be sold in certain   
limited circumstances to protect a Portfolio based on advice from the           
Supervisor. These situations may include events such as the issuer having       
defaulted on payment of any of its outstanding obligations or the price of a    
Security has declined to such an extent or other credit factors exist so that in
the opinion of the Supervisor retention of the Security would be detrimental to 
a Portfolio. If a public tender offer has been made for a Security or a merger  
or acquisition has been announced affecting a Security, the Trustee may either  
sell the Security or accept an offer if the Supervisor determines that the sale 
or exchange is in the best interest of Unitholders. The Trustee will distribute 
any cash proceeds to Unitholders. In addition, the Trustee may sell Securities  
to redeem Units or pay Portfolio expenses or deferred sales charges. The Trustee
must reject any offer for securities or property other than cash in exchange for
the Securities. If securities or property are nonetheless acquired by a         
Portfolio, the Sponsor may direct the Trustee to sell the securities or property
and distribute the proceeds to Unitholders or to accept the securities or       
property for deposit in the Portfolio. Should any contract for the purchase of  
any of the Securities fail, the Sponsor will (unless substantially all of the   
moneys held in a Portfolio to cover the purchase are reinvested in substitute   
Securities in accordance with the Trust Agreement) refund the cash and sales    
charge attributable to the failed contract to all Unitholders on or before the  
next Distribution Date.                                                         

   The Sponsor may direct the reinvestment of proceeds of the sale of Securities
if the sale is the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the
opinion of the Sponsor, would make retention of the Securities detrimental to a 
Portfolio. In such a case, the Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the 
reinvestment of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for
inclusion in a Portfolio on the Initial Date of Deposit. With respect to a      
Portfolio structured as a regulated investment company, the Sponsor may also    
instruct the Trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the Portfolio      
continues to satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company and to
avoid imposition of tax on undistributed income of the Portfolio.               

   The Trust Agreement requires the Trustee to vote all shares of the funds held
in a Portfolio in the same manner and ratio on all proposals as the owners of   
such shares not held by the Portfolio.                                          

When your Portfolio sells Securities, the composition and diversity of the
Securities in the Portfolio may be altered. However, if the Trustee sells funds 
shares to redeem Units or to pay Portfolio expenses or sales charges, the       
Trustee will do so, as nearly as practicable, on a pro rata basis. In order to  
obtain the best price for the Portfolio, it may be necessary for the Supervisor 
to specify minimum amounts in which blocks of Securities are to be sold. In     
effecting purchases and sales of portfolio securities, the Sponsor may direct   
that orders be placed with and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers,        
including brokers which may be affiliated with a Portfolio, the Sponsor or      
dealers participating in the offering of Units.                                 

Pursuant to an exemptive order, a Portfolio may be permitted to sell      
Securities to a new trust when it terminates if those Securities are included in
the new trust. The exemption may enable a Portfolio to eliminate commission     
costs on these transactions. The price for those securities will be the closing 
sale price on the sale date on the exchange where the Securities are principally
traded, as certified by the Sponsor.                                            

 Amendment of the Trust Agreement. The Trustee and the Sponsor may amend the
Trust Agreement without the consent of Unitholders to correct any provision     
which may be defective or to make other provisions that will not materially     
adversely affect Unitholders (as determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the
Trustee). The Trust Agreement may not be amended to increase the number of Units
or permit acquisition of securities in addition to or substitution for the      
Securities (except as provided in the Trust Agreement). The Trustee will notify 
Unitholders of any amendment.                                                   

  Termination. Your Portfolio will terminate on the Mandatory Termination Date
or upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security held in the          
Portfolio. Your Portfolio may be terminated at any time with consent of         
Unitholders representing two-thirds of the outstanding Units or by the Trustee  
when the value of the Portfolio is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value  
of the Portfolio has exceeded $15,000,000) (the "Minimum Termination Value").   
Your Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in the event that a sufficient 
number of Units of the Portfolio not yet sold are tendered for redemption by the
Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Portfolio would be reduced to less than   
40% of the value of the Securities at the time they were deposited in the       
Portfolio. If your Portfolio is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold  
Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units the    
entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. Unitholders will be notified of any 
termination. The Trustee may begin to sell Securities in connection with a      
Portfolio termination nine business days before, and no later than, the         
Mandatory Termination Date. Approximately forty-five days before this date, the 
Trustee will notify Unitholders of the termination and provide a form enabling  
qualified Unitholders to elect an in kind distribution of Securities, provided  
that Unitholders may not request an in-kind distribution of Securities within   
thirty days of the Portfolio's termination. Any in kind distribution of         
Securities will be made in the manner and subject to the restrictions described 
under "Rights of Unitholders--Redemption of Units". Unitholders will receive a  
final cash distribution within a reasonable time after the Mandatory Termination
Date. All distributions will be net of Portfolio expenses and costs. Unitholders
will receive a final distribution statement following termination. The          
Information Supplement contains further information regarding termination of    
your Portfolio. See "Additional Information".                                   

  Limitations on Liabilities. The Sponsor, Supervisor and Trustee are under no
liability for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good
faith pursuant to the Trust Agreement, or for errors in judgment, but shall be  
liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence    
(negligence in the case of the Trustee) in the performance of their duties or by
reason of their reckless disregard of their obligations and duties hereunder.   
The Trustee is not liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the    
sale by the Trustee of any of the Securities. In the event of the failure of the
Sponsor to act under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee may act thereunder and is 
not liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Trust Agreement.  
The Trustee is not liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed on
the Securities, on it as Trustee under the Trust Agreement or on a Portfolio    
which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present or future law of the 
United States of America or of any other taxing authority having jurisdiction.  
In addition, the Trust Agreement contains other customary provisions limiting   
the liability of the Trustee. The Sponsor and Supervisor may rely on any        
evaluation furnished by the Trustee and have no responsibility for the accuracy 
thereof. Determinations by the Trustee shall be made in good faith upon the     
basis of the best information available to it.

TAXATION - COHEN & STEERS MASTER MUNICIPAL                                      
INCOME PORTFOLIO - NATIONAL SERIES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the Portfolio. This section is current as of the date of this
prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries 
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these
summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a  
non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. 
In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or foreign tax    
consequences. This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice and
opinion of counsel to the sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree  
with any conclusions set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not
asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal   
income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the Portfolio. This may   
not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under    
federal tax law. As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your   
individual circumstances from your own tax advisor.                             

   Assets of the Portfolio. The Portfolio is expected to hold one or more of the
following:                                                                      

   (i) shares of stock in corporations (the "Stocks") that are treated as equity
for federal income tax purposes, and (ii) shares (the "RIC Shares") in funds    
qualifying as regulated investment companies ("RICs") that are treated as       
interests in regulated investment companies for federal income tax purposes.    

It is possible that the Portfolio will also hold other assets, including  
assets that are treated differently for federal income tax purposes from those  
described above, in which case you will have federal income tax consequences    
different from or in addition to those described in this section. All of the    
assets held by the Portfolio constitute the "Portfolio Assets." Neither our     
counsel nor we have analyzed the proper federal income tax treatment of the     
Portfolio Assets and thus neither our counsel nor we have reached a conclusion  
regarding the federal income tax treatment of the Portfolio Assets.             

Portfolio Status. If the Portfolio is at all times operated in accordance 
with the documents establishing the Portfolio and certain requirements of       
federal income tax law are met, the Portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation
for federal income tax purposes. As a unit owner, you will be treated as the    
owner of a pro rata portion of each of the Portfolio Assets, and as such you    
will be considered to have received a pro rata share of income (e.g., dividends,
and capital gains, if any) from each Portfolio Asset when such income would be  
considered to be received by you if you directly owned the Portfolio Assets.    
This is true even if you elect to have your distributions reinvested into       
additional units. In addition, the income from Portfolio Assets that you must   
take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used
to pay sales charges or Portfolio expenses.                                     

Your Tax Basis and Income or Loss upon Disposition. If your Portfolio     
disposes of Portfolio Assets, you will generally recognize gain or loss. If you 
dispose of your units or redeem your units for cash, you will also generally    
recognize gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must  
subtract your tax basis in the related Portfolio Assets from your share of the  
total amount received in the transaction. You can generally determine your      
initial tax basis in each Portfolio Asset by apportioning the cost of your      
units, including sales charges, among the Portfolio Assets ratably according to 
their values on the date you acquire your units. In certain circumstances,      
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you acquire your units (for
example, in the case of certain dividends that exceed a corporation's           
accumulated earnings and profits, as discussed below). If you are an individual,
the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 15%     
(generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). These     
capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before  
January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an individual, the maximum       
marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain
taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% and  
the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term capital gains from most property    
acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding period of more than five years. 
Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term capital 
loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding     
period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the holding     
period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you purchase
your units to determine your holding period. The tax rates for capital gains    
realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for    
ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code, however, treats certain capital     
gains as ordinary income in special situations.                                 

  Dividends from Stocks. Certain dividends received with respect to the Stocks
may qualify to be taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as    
discussed above), provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied.   
These special rules relating to the taxation of dividends at capital gains rates
generally apply to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2011.              

   Dividends from RIC Shares. Some dividends on the RIC Shares may be designated
as "capital gain dividends," generally taxable to you as long-term capital      
gains. Other dividends on the RIC Shares will generally be taxable to you as    
ordinary income. Certain ordinary income dividends from a RIC may qualify to be 
taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above),    
provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the     
dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the RIC itself.  
These special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from  
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011. Regulated investment companies are required to provide notice  
to their shareholders of the amount of any distribution that may be taken into  
account as a dividend that is eligible for the capital gains tax rates. If you  
hold a unit for six months or less or if your Portfolio holds a RIC Share for   
six months or less, any loss incurred by you related to the disposition of such 
RIC Share will be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent of any      
long-term capital gain distributions received (or deemed to have been received) 
with respect to such RIC Share. Distributions of income or capital gains        
declared on the RIC Shares in October, November or December will be deemed to   
have been paid to you on December 31 of the year they are declared, even when   
paid by the RIC during the following January.                                   

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received by the Portfolio, because the dividends received deduction is
generally not available for dividends from most foreign corporations or from    
RICs. However, certain dividends on the RIC Shares that are attributable to     
dividends received by the RIC from certain domestic corporations may be         
designated by the RIC as being eligible for the dividends received deduction.   

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances as described in this   
prospectus, you may request an In-Kind Distribution of Portfolio Assets when you
redeem your units. By electing to receive an In-Kind Distribution, you will     
receive Portfolio Assets plus, possibly, cash. You will not recognize gain or   
loss if you only receive whole Portfolio Assets in exchange for the identical   
amount of your pro rata portion of the same Portfolio Assets held by your       
Portfolio. However, if you also receive cash in exchange for a Portfolio Asset  
or a fractional portion of a Portfolio Asset, you will generally recognize gain 
or loss based on the difference between the amount of cash you receive and your 
tax basis in such Portfolio Asset or fractional portion.                        

   Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your Portfolio rolled over
into a future Portfolio, it is considered a sale for federal income tax purposes
and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, and any loss will be
treated as a capital loss. However, any loss you incur in connection with the   
exchange of your units of your Portfolio for units of a new Portfolio will      
generally be disallowed with respect to this deemed sale and subsequent deemed  
repurchase, to the extent the two Portfolios have substantially identical       
Portfolio Assets under the wash sale provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.   

Limitations on the Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses. Generally, for    
federal income tax purposes, you must take into account your full pro rata share
of your Portfolio's income, even if some of that income is used to pay Portfolio
expenses. You may deduct your pro rata share of each expense paid by your       
Portfolio to the same extent as if you directly paid the expense. You may be    
required to treat some or all of the expenses of your Portfolio as miscellaneous
itemized deductions. Individuals may only deduct certain miscellaneous itemized 
deductions to the extent they exceed 2% of adjusted gross income.               

Foreign Taxes. Distributions by your Portfolio that are treated as U.S.   
source income (e.g., dividends received on Stocks of domestic corporations) will
generally be subject to U.S. income taxation and withholding in the case of     
units held by nonresident alien individuals, foreign corporations or other      
non-U.S. persons, subject to any applicable treaty. If you are a foreign        
investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S.     
corporation, partnership, estate or Portfolio), you may not be subject to U.S.  
federal income taxes, including withholding taxes, on some of the income from   
your Portfolio or on any gain from the sale or redemption of your units,        
provided that certain conditions are met. You should consult your tax advisor   
with respect to the conditions you must meet in order to be exempt for U.S. tax 
purposes. You should also consult your tax advisor with respect to other U.S.   
tax withholding and reporting requirements. Some distributions by your Portfolio
may be subject to foreign withholding taxes. Any income withheld will still be  
treated as income to you. Under the grantor Portfolio rules, you are considered 
to have paid directly your share of any foreign taxes that are paid. Therefore, 
for U.S. tax purposes, you may be entitled to a foreign tax credit or deduction 
for those foreign taxes. Under certain circumstances, a RIC may elect to pass   
through to its shareholders certain foreign taxes paid by the RIC. If the RIC   
makes this election with respect to RIC Shares, you must include in your income 
for federal income tax purposes your portion of such taxes and you may be       
entitled to a credit or deduction for such taxes.                               

   New York Tax Status. Under the existing income tax laws of the State and City
of New York, your Portfolio will not be taxed as a corporation subject to the   
New York State franchise tax and New York City general corporation tax. You     
should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state or local     
taxation with respect to your Units.                                            

TAXATION - ALL OTHER PORTFOLIOS 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning Units of the Portfolios. This section is current as of the date of    
this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these      
summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers. For     
example, these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a  
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances. In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or 
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

  This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions   
set forth in this section. In addition, our counsel was not asked to review, and
has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of
the assets to be deposited in the Portfolios. This may not be sufficient for you
to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.             

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual   
circumstances from your own tax advisor.                                        

Portfolio Status. Your Portfolio intends to qualify as a "regulated       
investment company" under the federal tax laws. If your Portfolio qualifies as a
regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax  
law, the Portfolio generally will not pay federal income taxes.                 

 Distributions. Portfolio distributions are generally taxable. After the end
of each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your Portfolio's  
distributions into two categories, ordinary income distributions and capital    
gains dividends. Ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your      
ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, certain ordinary income 
distributions received from your Portfolio may be taxed at the capital gains tax
rates. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term       
capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. To determine    
your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must calculate  
your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of   
your other taxable transactions, as described below. In addition, your Portfolio
may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and  
thus will generally not be taxable to you. The tax status of your distributions 
from your Portfolio is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions  
in additional Units or receive them in cash. The income from your Portfolio that
you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by    
amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require   
you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on
December 31 of the previous year.                                               

Dividends Received Deduction. A corporation that owns Units generally will
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received from your Portfolio because the dividends received deduction 
is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment          
companies. However, certain ordinary income dividends on Units that are         
attributable to qualifying dividends received by your Portfolio from certain    
corporations may be designated by the Portfolio as being eligible for the       
dividends received deduction.                                                   

Sale or Redemption of Units. If you sell or redeem your Units, you will   
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain
or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your Units from the amount you     
receive in the transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal to  
the cost of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,       
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your Units.   

   Capital Gains and Losses and Certain Ordinary Income Dividends. If you are an
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax        
brackets). These new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable    
years beginning before January 1, 2011. For later periods, if you are an        
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets). The  
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term   
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the     
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must exclude the date you 
purchase your Units to determine your holding period. However, if you receive a 
capital gain dividend from your Portfolio and sell your Units at a loss after   
holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as long-term
capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates 
for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally  
the same as for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats certain       
capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.                         

Ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a    
regulated investment company such as your Portfolio are generally taxed at the  
same rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are        
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the Portfolio itself. These    
special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from        
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011. Your Portfolio will provide notice to its Unitholders of the   
amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which  
is eligible for these capital gains tax rates.                                  

In-Kind Distributions. Under certain circumstances, as described in this  
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of Portfolio securities when
you redeem Units. This distribution is subject to taxation and you will         
recognize gain or loss, generally based on the value at that time of the        
securities and the amount of cash received.                                     

Rollovers and Exchanges. If you elect to have your proceeds from your     
Portfolio rolled over into a future trust, it is considered a sale for federal  
income tax purposes and any gain on the sale will be treated as a capital gain, 
and any loss will be treated as a capital loss. However, any loss realized on a 
sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that Units disposed of are    
replaced (including through reinvestment of dividends) within a period of 61    
days beginning 30 days before and ending 30 days after disposition of Units or  
to the extent that the Unitholder, during such period, acquires or enters into  
an option or contract to acquire, substantially identical stock or securities.  
In such a case, the basis of the Units acquired will be adjusted to reflect the 
disallowed loss.                                                                

Deductibility of Portfolio Expenses. Generally, expenses incurred by your 
Portfolio will be deducted from the gross income received by your Portfolio and 
only your share of the Portfolio's net income will be paid to you and reported  
as taxable income to you. However, if the Units of your Portfolio are held by   
fewer than 500 Unitholders at any time during a taxable year, your Portfolio    
will generally not be able to deduct certain expenses from income, thus         
resulting in your reported share of the Portfolio's taxable income being        
increased by your share of those expenses, even though you do not receive a     
corresponding cash distribution. In this case you may be able to take a         
deduction for these expenses; however, certain miscellaneous itemized           
deductions, such as investment expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to 
the extent that all of these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted  
gross income.                                                                   

  Foreign Tax Credit. If your Portfolio invests in any foreign securities, the
tax statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your   
Portfolio paid to other countries. In this case, dividends taxed to you will    
include your share of the taxes your Portfolio paid to other countries. You may 
be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.        

PORTFOLIO OPERATING EXPENSES 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 General. The fees and expenses of your Portfolio will generally accrue on a
daily basis. Portfolio operating fees and expenses are generally paid out of the
Income Account to the extent funds are available, and then from the Capital     
Account. The deferred sales charge, creation and development fee and            
organization costs are generally paid out of the Capital Account of your        
Portfolio. It is expected that Securities will be sold to pay these amounts     
which will result in capital gains or losses to Unitholders. See "Taxation".    
These sales will reduce future income distributions. The Sponsor's, Supervisor's
and Trustee's fees may be increased without approval of the Unitholders by      
amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category "All Services  
Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price Index or, if this category is not   
published, in a comparable category.                                            

  Organization Costs. You and the other Unitholders will bear all or a portion
of the organization costs and charges incurred in connection with the           
establishment of your Portfolio. These costs and charges will include the cost  
of the preparation, printing and execution of the trust agreement, registration 
statement and other documents relating to your Portfolio, federal and state     
registration fees and costs, the Portfolio Consultant's stock selection fee, the
initial fees and expenses of the Trustee, and legal and auditing expenses. The  
Public Offering Price of Units includes the estimated amount of these costs. The
Trustee will deduct these expenses from your Portfolio's assets at the end of   
the initial offering period.                                                    

Creation and Development Fee. The Sponsor will receive a fee from your    
Portfolio for creating and developing the Portfolio, including determining the  
Portfolio's objectives, policies, composition and size, selecting service       
providers and information services and for providing other similar              
administrative and ministerial functions. The creation and development fee is a 
charge of $0.05 per Unit. The Trustee will deduct this amount from your         
Portfolio's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. No portion of
this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as compensation  
for sales efforts. This fee will not be deducted from proceeds received upon a  
repurchase, redemption or exchange of Units before the close of the initial     
public offering period.                                                         

Trustee's Fee. For its services the Trustee will receive the fee from your
Portfolio set forth in the "Fee Table" (which includes the estimated amount of  
miscellaneous Portfolio expenses). The Trustee benefits to the extent there are 
funds in the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest  
bearing to Unitholders and the amounts earned by the Trustee are retained by the
Trustee. Part of the Trustee's compensation for its services to your Portfolio  
is expected to result from the use of these funds.                              

   Compensation of Sponsor and Supervisor. The Sponsor and the Supervisor, which
is an affiliate of the Sponsor other than the Cohen & Steers Master Equity and  
Income Portfolio, the Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio and the Cohen &    
Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio-National Series, will receive the      
annual fees for providing bookkeeping and administrative services and portfolio 
supervisory services set forth in the "Fee Table". These fees may exceed the    
actual costs of providing these services to your Portfolio but at no time will  
the total amount received for these services rendered to all Van Kampen unit    
investment trusts in any calendar year exceed the aggregate cost of providing   
these services in that year. The Supervisor's fee for the Cohen & Steers Master 
Equity and Income Portfolio, the Cohen & Steers Master Income Portfolio and the 
Cohen & Steers Master Municipal Income Portfolio-National Series is charged as a
percentage of average daily net asset value and accrues daily and is paid       
quarterly.

RISK FACTORS 

Closed-End Funds. Closed-end funds' portfolios are managed and their shares
are generally listed on a securities exchange. The net asset value of closed-end
fund shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of the underlying          
securities that the closed-end fund owns. In addition, for various reasons      
closed-end fund shares frequently trade at a discount from their net asset value
in the secondary market. The amount of such discount from net asset value is    
subject to change from time to time in response to various factors. Closed-end  
funds' articles of incorporation may contain certain anti-takeover provisions   
that may have the effect of inhibiting a fund's possible conversion to open-end 
status and limiting the ability of other persons to acquire control of a fund.  
In certain circumstances, these provisions might also inhibit the ability of    
stockholders (including the Portfolios) to sell their shares at a premium over  
prevailing market prices. This characteristic is a risk separate and distinct   
from the risk that a fund's net asset value will decrease. In particular, this  
characteristic would increase the loss or reduce the return on the sale of those
closed-end fund shares that were purchased by the Portfolios at a premium. In   
the unlikely event that a closed-end fund converts to open-end status at a time 
when its shares are trading at a premium there would be an immediate loss in    
value to the Portfolios since shares of open-end funds trade at net asset value.
Certain closed-end funds may have in place or may put in place in the future    
plans pursuant to which the fund may repurchase its own shares in the           
marketplace. Typically, these plans are put in place in an attempt by a fund's  
board of directors to reduce a discount on its share price. To the extent that  
such a plan is implemented and shares owned by the Portfolios are repurchased by
a fund, the Portfolios' position in that fund will be reduced and the cash will 
be distributed.                                                                 

The Portfolios are prohibited from subscribing to a rights offering for   
shares of any of the closed-end funds in which it invests. In the event of a    
rights offering for additional shares of a fund, Unitholders should expect that 
a Portfolio will, at the completion of the offer, own a smaller proportional    
interest in such fund that would otherwise be the case. It is not possible to   
determine the extent of this dilution in share ownership without knowing what   
proportion of the shares in a rights offering will be subscribed. This may be   
particularly serious when the subscription price per share for the offer is less
than the fund's net asset value per share. Assuming that all rights are         
exercised and there is no change in the net asset value per share, the aggregate
net asset value of each shareholder's shares of common stock should decrease as 
a result of the offer. If a fund's subscription price per share is below that   
fund's net asset value per share at the expiration of the offer, shareholders   
would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their
shares of common stock as a result of the offer, which could be substantial.    

Closed-end funds may use leveraging in their portfolios. Leveraging can be
expected to cause increased price volatility for those fund's shares, and as a  
result, increased volatility for the price of the Units of a Portfolio. There   
can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be successful during any    
period in which it is employed.                                                 

Municipal Bonds. The closed-end funds in the Portfolio invest in certain  
types of bonds described below. Accordingly, an investment in the Portfolio     
should be made with an understanding of the characteristics of and risks        
associated with such bonds.                                                     

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be general obligations of a 
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity. Other   
bonds are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or        
authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes. General    
obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and    
taxing power for the payment of principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the   
other hand, are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular        
facility or class of facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a       
special excise tax or other specific revenue source. There are, of course,      
variations in the security of the different bonds in a closed-end fund, both    
within a particular classification and between classifications, depending on    
numerous factors.                                                               

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations which derive 
their payments from mortgage loans. Certain of such housing bonds may be FHA    
insured or may be single family mortgage revenue bonds issued for the purpose of
acquiring from originating financial institutions notes secured by mortgages on 
residences located within the issuer's boundaries and owned by persons of low or
moderate income. Mortgage loans are generally partially or completely prepaid   
prior to their final maturities as a result of events such as sale of the       
mortgaged premises, default, condemnation or casualty loss. Because these bonds 
are subject to extraordinary mandatory redemption in whole or in part from such 
prepayments of mortgage loans, a substantial portion of such bonds will probably
be redeemed prior to their scheduled maturities or even prior to their ordinary 
call dates. Extraordinary mandatory redemption without premium could also result
from the failure of the originating financial institutions to make mortgage     
loans in sufficient amounts within a specified time period. Additionally,       
unusually high rates of default on the underlying mortgage loans may reduce     
revenues available for the payment of principal of or interest on such mortgage 
revenue bonds. These bonds were issued under Section 103A of the Internal       
Revenue Code, which Section contains certain requirements relating to the use of
the proceeds of such bonds in order for the interest on such bonds to retain its
tax-exempt status. In each case the issuer of the bonds has covenanted to comply
with applicable requirements and bond counsel to such issuer has issued an      
opinion that the interest on the bonds is exempt from Federal income tax under  
existing laws and regulations. Certain issuers of housing bonds have considered 
various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first         
redemption dates for such bonds.                                                

 Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be health care revenue bonds.
Ratings of bonds issued for health care facilities are often based on           
feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels, revenues and  
expenses. A facility's gross receipts and net income available for debt service 
may be affected by future events and conditions including, among other things,  
demand for services and the ability of the facility to provide the services     
required, physicians' confidence in the facility, management capabilities,      
competition with other health care facilities, efforts by insurers and          
governmental agencies to limit rates, legislation establishing state            
rate-setting agencies, expenses, the cost and possible unavailability of        
malpractice insurance, the funding of Medicare, Medicaid and other similar third
party pay or programs, government regulation and the termination or restriction 
of governmental financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare,  
Medicaid and other similar third party pay or programs.                         

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations of public    
utility issuers, including those selling wholesale and retail electric power and
gas. General problems of such issuers would include the difficulty in financing 
large construction programs in an inflationary period, the limitations on       
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental         
considerations, the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, 
the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy  
conservation. In addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental authorities
may from time to time review existing, and impose additional, regulations       
governing the licensing, construction and operation of nuclear power plants,    
which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of certain of the bonds in
a closed-end fund to make payments of principal and/or interest on such bonds.  

   Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations of issuers whose
revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services. Such bonds
are generally payable from user fees. The problems of such issuers include the  
ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline        
resulting in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays          
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty of      
obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation
programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                       

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be industrial revenue bonds 
("IRBs"). IRBs have generally been issued under bond resolutions pursuant to    
which the revenues and receipts payable under the arrangements with the operator
of a particular project have been assigned and pledged to purchasers. In some   
cases, a mortgage on the underlying project may have been granted as security   
for the IRBs. Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent  
upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate 
guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors    
which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company
or industry. These include cyclicality of revenues and earnings, regulatory and 
environmental restrictions, litigation resulting from accidents or              
environmentally-caused illnesses, extensive competition and financial           
deterioration resulting from a corporate restructuring pursuant to a leveraged  
buy-out, takeover or otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator 
of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's      
creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating and/or
market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of such a restructuring may
have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such     
bonds, even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or   
effected.                                                                       

   Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations that are secured
by lease payments of a governmental entity (hereinafter called "lease           
obligations"). Lease obligations are often in the form of certificates of       
participation. Although the lease obligations do not constitute general         
obligations of the municipality for which the municipality's taxing power is    
pledged, a lease obligation is ordinarily backed by the municipality's covenant 
to appropriate for and make the payments due under the lease obligation.        
However, certain lease obligations contain "non-appropriation" clauses which    
provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease payments in future
years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. A        
governmental entity that enters into such a lease agreement cannot obligate     
future governments to appropriate for and make lease payments but covenants to  
take such action as is necessary to include any lease payments due in its       
budgets and to make the appropriations therefor. A governmental entity's failure
to appropriate for and to make payments under its lease obligation could result 
in insufficient funds available for payment of the obligations secured thereby. 
Although "non-appropriation" lease obligations are secured by the leased        
property, disposition of the property in the event of foreclosure might prove   
difficult.                                                                      

   Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations of issuers which
are, or which govern the operation of, schools, colleges and universities and   
whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education 
systems, from tuition, dormitory revenues, grants and endowments. General       
problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state       
constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes,  
thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in       
wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on this issue
may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds.      
General problems relating to college and university obligations include the     
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of "college" age
individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover
increased operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of Federal      
grants and state funding, and government legislation or regulations which may   
adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers.                         

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations which are    
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities, convention   
centers and arenas. The major portion of an airport's gross operating income is 
generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use    
agreements which consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain    
terminal space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be      
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use 
agreements. From time to time the air transport industry has experienced        
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased competition,   
excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic constraints and other   
factors, and several airlines have experienced severe financial difficulties.   
Similarly, payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues
from the projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges 
and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by       
reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance,     
decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, 
scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                

Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be obligations which are    
payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource     
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid 
waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds 
may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence  
of certain circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or          
condemnation of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,       
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of 
raw materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a
project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the   
operation of a project; and administrative or judicial actions which render     
contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform 
or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot     
predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds   
prior to the stated maturity of the bonds.                                      

  Certain of the bonds in a closed-end fund may be subject to redemption prior
to their stated maturity date pursuant to sinking fund provisions, call         
provisions or extraordinary optional or mandatory redemption provisions or      
otherwise. A sinking fund is a reserve fund accumulated over a period of time   
for retirement of debt. A callable debt obligation is one which is subject to   
redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A        
refunding is a method by which a debt obligation is redeemed, at or before      
maturity, by the proceeds of a new debt obligation. In general, call provisions 
are more likely to be exercised when the offering side valuation is at a premium
over par than when it is at a discount from par. The exercise of redemption or  
call provisions will result in the distribution of principal and may result in a
reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions. Extraordinary     
optional redemptions and mandatory redemptions result from the happening of     
certain events. Generally, events that may permit the extraordinary optional    
redemption of bonds or may require the mandatory redemption of bonds include,   
among others: a final determination that the interest on the bonds is taxable;  
the substantial damage or destruction by fire or other casualty of the project  
for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; an exercise by a local, state or 
Federal governmental unit of its power of eminent domain to take all or         
substantially all of the project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used; 
changes in the economic availability of raw materials, operating supplies or    
facilities or technological or other changes which render the operation of the  
project for which the proceeds of the bonds were used uneconomic; changes in law
or an administrative or judicial decree which renders the performance of the    
agreement under which the proceeds of the bonds were made available to finance  
the project impossible or which creates unreasonable burdens or which imposes   
excessive liabilities, such as taxes, not imposed on the date the bonds are     
issued on the issuer of the bonds or the user of the proceeds of the bonds; an  
administrative or judicial decree which requires the cessation of a substantial 
part of the operations of the project financed with the proceeds of the bonds;  
an overestimate of the costs of the project to be financed with the proceeds of 
the bonds resulting in excess proceeds of the bonds which may be applied to     
redeem bonds; or an underestimate of a source of funds securing the bonds       
resulting in excess funds which may be applied to redeem bonds. The issuer of   
certain bonds in a closed-end fund may have sold or reserved the right to sell, 
upon the satisfaction of certain conditions, to third parties all or any portion
of its rights to call bonds in accordance with the stated redemption provisions 
of such bonds. In such a case the issuer no longer has the right to call the    
bonds for redemption unless it reacquires the rights from such third party. A   
third party pursuant to these rights may exercise the redemption provisions with
respect to a bond at a time when the issuer of the bond might not have called a 
bond for redemption had it not sold such rights. No one can predict all of the  
circumstances which may result in such redemption of an issue of bonds. See also
the discussion of single family mortgage and multi-family revenue bonds above   
for more information on the call provisions of such bonds.                      

  Senior Loans. The closed-end funds in a Portfolio may invest in senior loans
issued by banks, other financial institutions, and other investors to           
corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies and other entities to   
finance leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations, mergers, acquisitions, stock      
repurchases, debt refinancings and, to a lesser extent, for general operating   
and other purposes. Senior loans in which the closed-end funds invest:          

o   generally are of below investment grade credit quality;             

o   may be unrated at the time of investment;                           

o   generally are not registered with the SEC or any state securities   
commission; and                                                 

o   generally are not listed on any securities exchange.                

An investment by closed-end funds in senior loans involves risk that the  
borrowers under senior loans may default on their obligations to pay principal  
or interest when due. Although senior loans may be secured by specific          
collateral, there can be no assurance that liquidation of collateral would      
satisfy the borrower's obligation in the event of non-payment or that such      
collateral could be readily liquidated. Senior loans are typically structured as
floating rate instruments in which the interest rate payable on the obligation  
fluctuates with interest rate changes. As a result, the yield on closed-end     
funds investing in senior loans will generally decline in a falling interest    
rate environment and increase in a rising interest rate environment.            

  The amount of public information available on senior loans generally will be
less extensive than that available for other types of assets. No reliable,      
active trading market currently exists for many senior loans, although a        
secondary market for certain senior loans has developed over the past several   
years. Senior loans are thus relatively illiquid. Liquidity relates to the      
ability of a closed-end fund to sell an investment in a timely manner at a price
approximately equal to its value on the closed-end fund's books. The illiquidity
of senior loans may impair a closed-end fund's ability to realized the full     
value of its assets in the event of a voluntary or involuntary liquidation of   
such assets. Because of the lack of an active trading market, illiquid          
securities are also difficult to value and prices provided by external pricing  
services may not reflect the true value of the securities. However, many senior 
loans are of a large principal amount and are held by a large number of         
financial institutions. To the extent that a secondary market does exist for    
certain senior loans, the market may be subject to irregular trading activity,  
wide bid/ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods. The market for      
senior loans could be disrupted in the event of an economic downturn or a       
substantial increase or decrease in interest rates. This could result in        
increased volatility in the market and in a Portfolio's net asset value.        

  If legislation or state or federal regulators impose additional requirements
or restrictions on the ability of financial institutions to make loans that are 
considered highly leveraged transactions, the availability of senior loans for  
investment by the closed-end funds may be adversely affected. In addition, such 
requirements or restrictions could reduce or eliminate sources of financing for 
certain borrowers. This would increase the risk of default. If legislation or   
federal or state regulators require financial institutions to dispose of senior 
loans that are considered highly leveraged transactions or subject such senior  
loans to increased regulatory scrutiny, financial institutions may determine to 
sell such senior loans. Such sales could result in depressed prices. If a       
closed-end fund attempts to sell a senior loan at a time when a financial       
institution is engaging in such a sale, the price a closed-end fund could get   
for the senior loan may be adversely affected.                                  

Some senior loans are subject to the risk that a court, pursuant to       
fraudulent conveyance or other similar laws, could subordinate the senior loans 
to presently existing or future indebtedness of the borrower or take other      
action detrimental to lenders. Such court action could under certain            
circumstances include invalidation of senior loans. Any lender, which could     
include a closed-end fund, is subject to the risk that a court could find the   
lender liable for damages in a claim by a borrower arising under the common laws
of tort or contracts or anti-fraud provisions of certain securities laws for    
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the lenders under the relevant terms of 
a loan agreement or in connection with actions with respect to the collateral   
underlying the senior loan.                                                     

High-Yield Securities. An investment in Units of the Portfolios should be 
made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in "high-yield,      
high-risk" debt obligations or "junk" obligations may entail, including         
increased credit risks and the risk that the value of the Units will decline,   
and may decline precipitously, with increases in interest rates. In recent years
there have been wide fluctuations in interest rates and thus in the value of    
debt obligations generally. Certain of the securities included in the funds in  
the Portfolios may be subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss of
income and principal than are investments in lower-yielding, higher-rated       
securities, and their value may decline precipitously because of increases in   
interest rates, not only because the increases in rates generally decrease      
values, but also because increased rates may indicate a slowdown in the economy 
and a decrease in the value of assets generally that may adversely affect the   
credit of issuers of high-yield, high-risk securities resulting in a higher     
incidence of defaults among high-yield, high-risk securities. A slowdown in the 
economy, or a development adversely affecting an issuer's creditworthiness, may 
result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings or sell assets at the    
rate and at the prices, respectively, that are required to produce sufficient   
cash flow to meet its interest and principal requirements. For an issuer that   
has outstanding both senior commercial bank debt and subordinated high-yield,   
high-risk securities, an increase in interest rates will increase that issuer's 
interest expense insofar as the interest rate on the bank debt is fluctuating.  
However, many leveraged issuers enter into interest rate protection agreements  
to fix or cap the interest rate on a large portion of their bank debt. This     
reduces exposure to increasing rates, but reduces the benefit to the issuer of  
declining rates. The sponsor cannot predict future economic policies or their   
consequences or, therefore, the course or extent of any similar market          
fluctuations in the future.                                                     

"High-yield" or "junk" securities, the generic names for securities rated 
below BBB by Standard & Poor's, or below Baa by Moody's, are frequently issued  
by corporations in the growth stage of their development, by established        
companies whose operations or industries are depressed or by highly leveraged   
companies purchased in leveraged buyout transactions. The market for high-yield 
securities is very specialized and investors in it have been predominantly      
financial institutions. High-yield securities are generally not listed on a     
national securities exchange. Trading of high- yield securities, therefore,     
takes place primarily in over-the-counter markets that consist of groups of     
dealer firms that are typically major securities firms. Because the high-yield  
security market is a dealer market, rather than an auction market, no single    
obtainable price for a given security prevails at any given time. Prices are    
determined by negotiation between traders. The existence of a liquid trading    
market for the securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in   
the securities. There can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of 
the securities, that any market for the securities will be maintained or of the 
liquidity of the securities in any markets made. Not all dealers maintain       
markets in all high-yield securities. Therefore, since there are fewer traders  
in these securities than there are in "investment grade" securities, the        
bid-offer spread is usually greater for high-yield securities than it is for    
investment grade securities. The price at which the securities may be sold and  
the value of a Portfolio will be adversely affected if trading markets for the  
securities are limited or absent. If the rate of redemptions is great, the value
of a Portfolio may decline to a level that requires liquidation.                

Lower-rated securities tend to offer higher yields than higher-rated      
securities with the same maturities because the creditworthiness of the issuers 
of lower-rated securities may not be as strong as that of other issuers.        
Moreover, if a security is recharacterized as equity by the Internal Revenue    
Service for federal income tax purposes, the issuer's interest deduction with   
respect to the security will be disallowed and this disallowance may adversely  
affect the issuer's credit rating. Because investors generally perceive that    
there are greater risks associated with the lower-rated securities in the funds 
in the Portfolios, the yields and prices of these securities tend to fluctuate  
more than higher- rated securities with changes in the perceived quality of the 
credit of their issuers. In addition, the market value of high-yield, high-risk 
securities may fluctuate more than the market value of higher-rated securities  
since these securities tend to reflect short-term credit development to a       
greater extent than higher-rated securities. Lower-rated securities generally   
involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than higher-rated         
securities. Issuers of lower-rated securities may possess fewer creditworthiness
characteristics than issuers of higher-rated securities and, especially in the  
case of issuers whose obligations or credit standing have recently been         
downgraded, may be subject to claims by debtholders, owners of property leased  
to the issuer or others which, if sustained, would make it more difficult for   
the issuers to meet their payment obligations. High-yield, high-risk securities 
are also affected by variables such as interest rates, inflation rates and real 
growth in the economy. Therefore, investors should consider carefully the       
relative risks associated with investment in securities that carry lower        
ratings.                                                                        

The value of the shares of the closed-end funds reflects the value of the 
portfolio securities, including the value (if any) of securities in default.    
Should the issuer of any security default in the payment of principal or        
interest, the closed-end funds in the Portfolios may incur additional expenses  
seeking payment on the defaulted security. Because amounts (if any) recovered by
the funds in payment under the defaulted security may not be reflected in the   
value of the fund shares until actually received by the funds, and depending    
upon when a Unitholder purchases or sells his or her Units, it is possible that 
a Unitholder would bear a portion of the cost of recovery without receiving any 
portion of the payment recovered.                                               

  High-yield, high-risk securities are generally subordinated obligations. The
payment of principal (and premium, if any), interest and sinking fund           
requirements with respect to subordinated obligations of an issuer is           
subordinated in right of payment to the payment of senior obligations of the    
issuer. Senior obligations generally include most, if not all, significant debt 
obligations of an issuer, whether existing at the time of issuance of           
subordinated debt or created thereafter. Upon any distribution of the assets of 
an issuer with subordinated obligations upon dissolution, total or partial      
liquidation or reorganization of or similar proceeding relating to the issuer,  
the holders of senior indebtedness will be entitled to receive payment in full  
before holders of subordinated indebtedness will be entitled to receive any     
payment. Moreover, generally no payment with respect to subordinated            
indebtedness may be made while there exists a default with respect to any senior
indebtedness. Thus, in the event of insolvency, holders of senior indebtedness  
of an issuer generally will recover more, ratably, than holders of subordinated 
indebtedness of that issuer.                                                    

   Obligations that are rated lower than "BBB" by Standard & Poor's, or "Baa" by
Moody's, respectively, should be considered speculative as such ratings indicate
a quality of less than investment grade. Investors should carefully review the  
objective of a Portfolio and consider their ability to assume the risks involved
before making an investment in the Portfolio.                                   

 Foreign Issuers. Since certain of the underlying securities held by certain
of the closed-end funds Units are issued by foreign companies, an investment in 
the Portfolios involves certain investment risks that are different in some     
respects from an investment in a Portfolio which invests entirely in the        
securities of domestic issuers. These investment risks include future political 
or governmental restrictions which might adversely affect the payment or receipt
of payment of dividends on the relevant securities, the possibility that the    
financial condition of the issuers of the securities may become impaired or that
the general condition of the relevant stock market may worsen (both of which    
would contribute directly to a decrease in the value of the securities and thus 
in the value of the Units), the limited liquidity and relatively small market   
capitalization of the relevant securities market, expropriation or confiscatory 
taxation, economic uncertainties and foreign currency devaluations and          
fluctuations. In addition, for foreign issuers that are not subject to the      
reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, there may be less
publicly available information than is available from a domestic issuer. In     
addition, foreign issuers are not necessarily subject to uniform accounting,    
auditing and financial reporting standards, practices and requirements          
comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers. The securities of many      
foreign issuers are less liquid and their prices more volatile than securities  
of comparable domestic issuers. In addition, fixed brokerage commissions and    
other transaction costs in foreign securities markets are generally higher than 
in the United States and there is generally less government supervision and     
regulation of exchanges, brokers and issuers in foreign countries than there is 
in the United States.                                                           

Securities issued by non-U.S. issuers generally pay income in foreign     
currencies and principally trade in foreign currencies. Therefore, there is a   
risk that the U.S. dollar value of these securities will vary with fluctuations 
in the U.S. dollar foreign exchange rates for the various securities.           

There can be no assurance that exchange control regulations might not be  
adopted in the future which might adversely affect payment to the closed-end    
funds or the Portfolios. The adoption of exchange control regulations and other 
legal restrictions could have an adverse impact on the marketability of         
international securities in a Portfolio. In addition, restrictions on the       
settlement of transactions on either the purchase or sale side, or both, could  
cause delays or increase the costs associated with the purchase and sale of the 
foreign Securities and correspondingly could affect the price of the Units.     

 Investors should be aware that it may not be possible to buy all securities
at the same time because of the unavailability of any security, and restrictions
relating to the purchase of a security by reason of the federal securities laws 
or otherwise.                                                                   

Foreign securities generally have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 and may not be exempt from the registration requirements of such    
Act. Sales of non-exempt securities by a closed-end fund in the United States   
securities markets are subject to severe restrictions and may not be            
practicable. Accordingly, sales of these securities by a closed-end fund will   
generally be effected only in foreign securities markets. Investors should      
realize that the securities in the closed-end funds might be traded in foreign  
countries where the securities markets are not as developed or efficient and may
not be as liquid as those in the United States. The value of the securities will
be adversely affected if trading markets for the securities are limited or      
absent.                                                                         

 Discount Securities. Certain of the securities held by the closed-end funds
in the Portfolios may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at 
maturity. The coupon interest rates on the discount securities at the time they 
were purchased and deposited in the funds were lower than the current market    
interest rates for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type. If    
such interest rates for newly issued comparable securities increase, the market 
discount of previously issued securities will become greater, and if such       
interest rates for newly issued comparable securities decline, the market       
discount of previously issued securities will be reduced, other things being    
equal. Investors should also note that the value of securities purchased at a   
market discount will increase in value faster than securities purchased at a    
market premium if interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates        
increase, the value of securities purchased at a market discount will decrease  
faster than securities purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest  
rates rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium securities and the  
prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount securities will be reduced.     
Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of    
market confidence in the issue.                                                 

   Premium Securities. Certain of the securities held by the closed-end funds in
the Portfolios may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at     
maturity. The coupon interest rates on the premium securities at the time they  
were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates   
for newly issued securities of comparable rating and type. If such interest     
rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable securities decrease, the market 
premium of previously issued securities will be increased, and if such interest 
rates for newly issued comparable securities increase, the market premium of    
previously issued securities will be reduced, other things being equal. The     
current returns of securities trading at a market premium are initially higher  
than the current returns of comparable securities of a similar type issued at   
currently prevailing interest rates because premium securities tend to decrease 
in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable. 
Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through 
current income payments, early redemption of a premium security at par or early 
prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield. Redemption        
pursuant to call provisions generally will, and redemption pursuant to sinking  
fund provisions may, occur at times when the redeemed securities have an        
offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original     
issue discount securities a premium over the accreted value.                    

Liquidity. Whether or not the stocks in the Portfolios are listed on a
stock exchange, the stocks may delist from the exchange or principally trade in 
an over-the-counter market. As a result, the existence of a liquid trading      
market could depend on whether dealers will make a market in the stocks. We     
cannot guarantee that dealers will maintain a market or that any market will be 
liquid. The value of the stocks could fall if trading markets are limited or    
absent.                                                                         

     Additional Units. The Sponsor may create additional Units of the Portfolios
by depositing into a Portfolio additional stocks or cash with instructions to   
purchase additional stocks. A deposit could result in a dilution of your        
investment and anticipated income because of fluctuations in the price of the   
stocks between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the stocks and       
because the Portfolios will pay brokerage fees.                                 

 Voting. Only the Trustee may sell or vote the stocks in the Portfolios.
While you may sell or redeem your Units, you may not sell or vote the stocks in 
your Portfolio. The Trustee will vote the stocks in the same general proportion 
as shares held by other shareholders.                                           

THE PORTFOLIOS 

Investors should note that the selection criteria were applied to the 
Securities for inclusion in the Portfolios prior to the Initial Date of Deposit.
Should a Security no longer meet the criteria used for selection for the        
Portfolios, such Security will not as a result thereof be removed from a        
Portfolio.

other Series thereof. The information is included herein only for the purpose of
informing investors as to the financial responsibility of the Sponsor and its   
ability to carry out its contractual obligations. More detailed financial       
information will be made available by the Sponsor upon request).                

Van Kampen Funds Inc. and your Portfolio have adopted a code of ethics
requiring Van Kampen's employees who have access to information on Portfolio    
transactions to report personal securities transactions. The purpose of the code
is to avoid potential conflicts of interest and to prevent fraud, deception or  
misconduct with respect to your Portfolio.                                      

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the Trust
Agreement or become incapable of acting or shall become bankrupt or its affairs 
are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (i) appoint a        
successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the Trustee to be          
reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, (ii) terminate the Trust Agreement and liquidate a Portfolio as     
provided therein or (iii) continue to act as Trustee without terminating the    
Trust Agreement.                                                                

TRUSTEE INFORMATION                                                             

  The Trustee is The Bank of New York, a trust company organized under the
laws of New York. The Bank of New York has its principal unit investment trust  
division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 
221-7668. The Bank of New York is subject to supervision and examination by the 
Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York and the Board of Governors of  
the Federal Reserve System, and its deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation to the extent permitted by law.                           

   The duties of the Trustee are primarily ministerial in nature. It did not
participate in the selection of Securities for the Portfolios.                  

     In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee shall keep proper books
of record and account of all transactions at its office for the Portfolios. Such
records shall include the name and address of, and the number of Units of the   
Portfolios held by, every Unitholder. Such books and records shall be open to   
inspection by any Unitholder at all reasonable times during the usual business  
hours. The Trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to  
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation. The Trustee is required to keep a certified copy or duplicate       
original of the Trust Agreement on file in its office available for inspection  
at all reasonable times during the usual business hours by any Unitholder,      
together with a current list of the Securities held in the Portfolios.          

    Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of its responsibilities created by the Trust Agreement by     
executing an instrument in writing and filing the same with the Sponsor. The    
Trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of resignation to   
all Unitholders then of record, not less than 60 days before the date specified 
in such notice when such resignation is to take effect. The Sponsor upon        
receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a successor trustee
promptly. If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has been appointed and
has accepted the appointment within 30 days after notification, the retiring    
Trustee may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a 
successor. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee as
provided in the Trust Agreement at any time with or without cause. Notice of    
such removal and appointment shall be mailed to each Unitholder by the Sponsor. 
Upon execution of a written acceptance of such appointment by such successor    
trustee, all the rights, powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee 
shall vest in the successor. The resignation or removal of a Trustee becomes    
effective only when the successor trustee accepts its appointment as such or    
when a court of competent jurisdiction appoints a successor trustee.            

    Any corporation into which a Trustee may be merged or with which it may be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to  
which a Trustee shall be a party, shall be the successor trustee. The Trustee   
must be a banking corporation organized under the laws of the United States or  
any state and having at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided   
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

TAXATION 

The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax   
issues concerning the Portfolios and the purchase, ownership and disposition of 
Portfolio Units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and 
is qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of Portfolio Units, as  
well as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality,     
non-U.S. country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                 

 The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to the Portfolios. The Internal Revenue Service could  
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by the Portfolios. 
This may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of  
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

Certain Portfolios intend (i) to elect and (ii) to qualify annually as a  
regulated investment company under the Code and to comply with applicable       
distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal income tax on income  
and capital gains distributed to its Unitholders.                               

To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally  
accorded to regulated investment companies, a Portfolio must, among other       
things, (a) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from   
dividends, interest, payments with respect to securities loans and gains from   
the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies or     
other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock,   
securities or currencies, and net income from certain publicly traded           
partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of 
the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the market value of the Portfolio's assets
is represented by cash and cash items (including receivables), U.S. government  
securities, the securities of other regulated investment companies and other    
securities, with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for  
the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value  
of the Portfolio's total assets and not greater than 10% of the outstanding     
voting securities of such issuer, and (ii) not more than 25% of the value of its
total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government          
securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies) of any one
issuer, or two or more issuers which the Portfolio controls and are engaged in  
the same, similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of certain 
publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at least 90% of its investment 
company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest  
and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses but  
excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least 90% of its net tax-exempt       
interest income each taxable year.                                              

  As a regulated investment company, a Portfolio generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short-term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to Unitholders. Your      
Portfolio intends to distribute to its Unitholders, at least annually,          
substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain.
If a Portfolio retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable       
income, it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate 
rates on the amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely  
basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to
a nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, a Portfolio distributes during 
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your Portfolio intends to make its distributions 
in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your 
Portfolio retains any net capital gain, the Portfolio may designate the retained
amount as undistributed capital gains in a notice to Unitholders who, if subject
to federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include
in income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their     
share of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their   
proportionate share of the tax paid by the Portfolio against their federal      
income tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit    
exceeds such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 
of the current calendar year if it is declared by a Portfolio in October,       
November or December with a record date in such a month and paid by the         
Portfolio during January of the following calendar year. These distributions    
will be taxable to Unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions  
are declared, rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are      
received.                                                                       

  If a Portfolio failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the Portfolio  
would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such   
income were distributed to its Unitholders) and all distributions out of        
earnings and profits would be taxed to Unitholders as ordinary dividend income. 

If a Portfolio is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or 
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and all
U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or value of 
the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated as a      
"controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") from a U.S. tax perspective. In such 
circumstances, a Portfolio will be required to include certain types of passive 
income and certain other types of income relating to insurance, sales and       
services with related parties and oil related income in the Portfolio's taxable 
income whether or not such income is distributed.                               

If a Portfolio holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as 
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold 
at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the  
Portfolio could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest   
charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity         
interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its          
Unitholders. A Portfolio will not be able to pass through to its Unitholders any
credit or deduction for such taxes. A Portfolio may be able to make an election 
that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences. In this case, a Portfolio 
would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such PFIC       
shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not
exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, a Portfolio     
might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions  
from PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year,   
and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement   
and would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax (described    
above). Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend       
income.                                                                         

Grantor Trusts                                                            

 If any U.S. investor is treated as owning directly or indirectly 10 percent
or more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and 
all U.S. shareholders of that corporation collectively own more than 50 percent 
of the vote or value of the stock of that corporation, the foreign corporation  
may be treated as a controlled foreign corporation (a "CFC"). If you own 10     
percent or more of a CFC (through a Portfolio and in combination with your other
investments) you will be required to include certain types of the CFC's income  
in your taxable income for federal income tax purposes whether or not such      
income is distributed to your Portfolio or to you.                              

A foreign corporation will generally be treated as a passive foreign      
investment company ("PFIC") if 75 percent or more of its income is passive      
income or if 50 percent or more of its assets are held to produce passive       
income. If your Portfolio purchases shares in a PFIC, you may be subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a portion of certain distributions or on gains from the   
disposition of such shares at rates that were applicable in prior years and any 
gain may be recharacterized as ordinary income that is not eligible for the     
lower net capital gains tax rate. Additional charges in the nature of interest  
may also be imposed on you. Certain elections may be available with respect to  
PFICs that would limit these consequences. However, these elections would       
require you to include certain income of the PFIC in your taxable income even if
not distributed to your Portfolio or to you, or require you to annually         
recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of the shares of the     
PFIC, thus requiring you to recognize income for federal income tax purposes in 
excess of your actual distributions from PFICs and proceeds from dispositions of
PFIC stock during a particular year. Dividends paid by PFICs will not be        
eligible to be taxed at the net capital gains tax rate.                         

PORTFOLIO TERMINATION                                                           

A Portfolio may be liquidated at any time by consent of Unitholders   
representing 66 2/3% of the Units of the Portfolio then outstanding or by the   
Trustee when the value of the Securities owned by the Portfolio, as shown by any
evaluation, is less than $500,000 ($3,000,000 if the value of the Portfolio has 
exceeded $15,000,000). A Portfolio will be liquidated by the Trustee in the     
event that a sufficient number of Units of the Portfolio not yet sold are       
tendered for redemption by the Sponsor, so that the net worth of the Portfolio  
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the Securities at the time    
they were deposited in the Portfolio. If a Portfolio is liquidated because of   
the redemption of unsold Units by the Sponsor, the Sponsor will refund to each  
purchaser of Units the entire sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Trust    
Agreement will terminate upon the sale or other disposition of the last Security
held thereunder, but in no event will it continue beyond the Mandatory          
Termination Date.                                                               

    Commencing during the period beginning nine business days prior to, and no
later than, the Mandatory Termination Date, Securities will begin to be sold in 
connection with the termination of a Portfolio. The Sponsor will determine the  
manner, timing and execution of the sales of the Securities. The Sponsor shall  
direct the liquidation of the Securities in such manner as to effectuate orderly
sales and a minimal market impact. In the event the Sponsor does not so direct, 
the Securities shall be sold within a reasonable period and in such manner as   
the Trustee, in its sole discretion, shall determine. At least 45 days before   
the Mandatory Termination Date the Trustee will provide written notice of any   
termination to all Unitholders of the Portfolios. Unitholders will receive a    
cash distribution from the sale of the remaining Securities within a reasonable 
time following the Mandatory Termination Date. The Trustee will deduct from the 
funds of a Portfolio any accrued costs, expenses, advances or indemnities       
provided by the Trust Agreement, including estimated compensation of the        
Trustee, costs of liquidation and any amounts required as a reserve to provide  
for payment of any applicable taxes or other governmental charges. Any sale of  
Securities in a Portfolio upon termination may result in a lower amount than    
might otherwise be realized if such sale were not required at such time. The    
Trustee will then distribute to each Unitholder of a Portfolio his pro rata     
share of the balance of the Income and Capital Accounts of the Portfolio.       

The Sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of the Portfolios. There is, however, no assurance that units 
of any new series of a Portfolio will be offered for sale at that time, or if   
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all Unitholders.                                             

  Within 60 days of the final distribution Unitholders will be furnished a
final distribution statement of the amount distributable. At such time as the   
Trustee in its sole discretion will determine that any amounts held in reserve  
are no longer necessary, it will make distribution thereof to Unitholders in the
same manner.

Unit Trusts
Unit Trusts provide a simple, convenient way to gain exposure to an asset class, market sector or investment discipline. Like a traditional mutual fund, unit trusts hold a pool of securities (such as stocks, bonds or alternative investments) chosen by a professional investment manager and are available with a wide range of objectives and risk levels.

Build America Bonds Income Trust (BABS0037)
	
		





Objective
		  	
		
		Build America Bonds are new taxable municipal bonds created from the $787 billion stimulus package passed in 2009 by Congress. The purpose of the bonds is to build and repair America's roads, bridges, transit and rail systems, schools, ports and inland waterways, and other infrastructure, while stimulating the U.S. economy and job growth. Van Kampen Unit Trusts provide investors with convenient access to a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal bonds with a low minimum investment, consistent monthly income, daily liquidity and transparency.




Investment objective The trust seeks to provide a high level of current income and to preserve capital. The trust invests in a portfolio of long-term taxable municipal bonds, primarily consisting of "Build America Bonds". As of the date of deposit, the trust will invest at least 80% of its assets in Build America Bonds, and may include other taxable municipal bonds for purposes of diversification.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.


1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data

Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.

About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.Investments in this trust may be subject to interest rate risk. If interest rates rise, the value of the bonds in a trust may decline and if interest rates decline the value of the bonds may increase. Also, the longer the period to maturity, the greater the sensitivity to interest rate changes tends to be.In particular, should a Build America Bond's issuer fail to continue to meet the applicable requirements imposed on the bonds as provided by the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, it is possible that such issuer may not receive federal cash subsidy payments, impairing the issuer's ability to make scheduled interest payments.The trust may concentrate in bonds of a particular type of issuer. This makes the trust less diversified and subject to a greater risk than a more diversified portfolio.
