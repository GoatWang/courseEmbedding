Louise (McCrary) Phanstiel
BS 85, LHD 14
Managing Director at Phanstiel Enterprises, LLC, Member, Board of Directors at Myriad
                              Genetics & Verastem
                           

                              
                                 OVERCOMING ADVERSITY
                              
                           





A COURAGEOUS ADVENTURE
Louise was in her mid-twenties and had a couple of years of college under her belt.
                              She was feeling uncertain about her future. With $200 in her pocket, she got in her
                              car and drove across the country.
                           
Working as a secretary to the purchasing agent for a small hair product manufacturer,
                              it didn't take long for the owner of the company to recognize Louise had a knack for
                              accounting the company soon offered to enroll her at Golden Gate University so she
                              could take some accounting courses. She worked during the day and went to school at
                              night.
                           
Louise later landed a position as a secretary at a small CPA firm in LA. Then she
                              landed a job as a second year staff person at Coopers & Lybrand. It was tough and
                              she worked hard to catch up, but she was recognizing along the way how much she loved
                              the accounting profession. As a partner at Coopers & Lybrand from 1993 to 1996, Louise
                              was responsible for managing the financial, actuarial, tax and advisory services for
                              30 clients. She specialized in life and property/casualty insurance, high technology
                              and non-profit higher education.
                           
In 1996, she was drawn to a new opportunity at WellPoint, Inc. where she would spend
                              the next 12 years. In her first position, she wore several hats with titles to match
                              including Senior Vice President, Chief Accounting Officer and Controller and CFO of
                              its major subsidiaries. She was responsible for corporate-wide planning, budgeting
                              and forecasting, and juggled a variety of responsibilities including redesigning the
                              company's reporting systems to support expansion to a national Fortune 50 company.
                              It was during the next several years at WellPoint that Louise had some of her greatest
                              successes as a strategic leader and as President of Specialty Products.
                           
MAKING A DIFFERENCE
In every position, she has worked toward making a difference. She challenges herself
                              and others along the way. Louise has been involved in a variety of philanthropic efforts
                              that include education, medical research and animal rights. She has served on numerous
                              boards throughout the years, including companies such as Myriad Genetrics, Verastem,
                              Inveresk Research Group, I Have a Dream Foundation and Cedars-Sinai Health Systems.
                              In 2013, Louise was the recipient of the Circle of Orange Award, recognizing leaders
                              who shape the future and create positive change.
                           
Syracuse students who were recipients of the Phanstiel Scholar Program tell stories
                              about how Louise makes a difference with more than just dollars. She guides them,
                              encourages them to focus on their career, and she considers them her family. She loves
                              to share how her grandmother lived a life of ‘selfless and silent philanthropy' and
                              was her first example of giving.
                           
In 2011, Golden Gate University recognized Louise as Alum of the Year. She delivered
                              the GGU commencement speech in 2014. She shares the importance of being the "CEO of
                              me" and reinforces the importance of having a plan, but to be ready for adversity,
                              disappointment, make mid-course corrections and reevaluate plans along the way. Her
                              career mantra: Act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog.
                           
CREATIVE PROJECTS
In 2008 Louise retired and also opened the door for new adventures, community involvement
                              and other hands-on projects such as: website design, a blog and YouTube channel of
                              instructional cooking videos. You can find all her creative work on www.myfoodvoice.me.

Bantle Chair in Business and Government PolicyResearch Experience in Ethics and HealthSawyer Law and Politics ProgramState of DemocracyThe Tanner Lecture Series on Ethics, Citizenship, and Public Responsibility





Howard and Louise Phanstiel     

Howard Phanstiel joined PacifiCare
Health Systems as executive vice president and chief financial officer
in July 2000.  In October 2000, he was
named to PacifiCare's board of directors,
and in December 2000 he was appointed president and chief executive officer. 
In February 2004, PacifiCare’s Board of Directors elected Phanstiel
Chairman and CEO.  In December 2005, he
led PacifiCare in its merger with UnitedHealth Group prior to retiring in April
2007.
Under Phanstiel’s leadership, PacifiCare transformed into a
leading consumer health organization offering a variety of consumer-driven
programs that provide more affordable and flexible health insurance and related
products.  As chief executive of one of the
nation’s largest Medicare Advantage companies, Phanstiel was frequently
interviewed by the national news media on a wide range of industry-related
issues.  He remains actively involved in
health care public policy issues.  

Prior to joining PacifiCare,
Phanstiel was chairman and CEO of ARV Assisted Living Inc. of Costa Mesa,
Calif.   Previously, he was executive
vice president, Finance and Information Services, at WellPoint Health Networks
Inc. in Woodland Hills, Calif.  

Phanstiel has also held various
executive and management positions with Prudential Bache International Bank and
Prudential Bache Securities, Marine Midland Banks, Sallie Mae and Citibank
N.A.  

Phanstiel’s
broad health care and management experience also includes the public sector at
both the state and federal level.  He has
served as a director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of the Health
Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in the U.S. Department of Health,
Education and Welfare.  

He was also division chief of the
Office of Fiscal Affairs at the Illinois Bureau of Budget and executive budget
officer at the Wisconsin Bureau of Planning and Budget.  Phanstiel received his Bachelor of Arts
degree in political science from Syracuse University in New York, and a Master’s
degree in Public Administration from the university’s Maxwell School of Citizenship
and Public Affairs.  He currently serves on the Maxwell
School Advisory Board and is Vice Chair of the Syracuse University Board of
Trustees.  Additionally, Phanstiel serves
on the Institutional Advancement, Athletic Advisory and Executive Committees
for Syracuse University. He also is a Co-Chairman of the Syracuse University
Capital Campaign.   

 

In 2001, Phanstiel was recognized for significant achievements and
contributions to the managed 
care sector by Who’s Who in Managed
Health Care.  In 2003 and 2004, he
was recognized as a Patriotic Employer by the National Committee for Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve
for PacifiCare’s generous support of its employees in the military reserve and
their families. In 2003, Phanstiel was honored at the Third Annual American
Heart Association’s Corazones Unidos/Hearts United gala for his dedication and
support provided to the Latino community. 
Phanstiel and PacifiCare have been honored with the Orange County Black
Chamber of Commerce 2004 Corporation of the Year Award; by LatinaSTYLE in 2004
and 2005 as one of the “50 Best Companies for Latinas” to work; by Hispanic
magazine as one of their 2004 and 2005 “Corporate 100” as one of the “Best
Places for Hispanics” to work; and by Asian Enterprise magazine in 2004 and
2005 as one of the “Best Companies to Work for Asian Americans.”  In 2005, Phanstiel and PacifiCare received the
Seven Seals Award for Patriotic Employers, and PacifiCare was selected as one
of the “50 Top Employers for Minorities” by FORTUNE magazine.  And, in
March 2005 he received the Director of the Year Award from the Forum for
Corporate Directors.  

 

Phanstiel, and his wife
Louise, are also active in several philanthropic endeavors, especially in
support of educational institutions at the elementary, high school, and
university levels. In October 2010 the Phanstiel’s announced a gift to SU in
the form an educational grant program known as the Phanstiel Scholars
Program.  This grant provides assistance
to SU students from middle income backgrounds that have demonstrated examples
of academic success and community leadership. 


 For Syracuse University, Phanstiel is
Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees and serves on the Institutional
Advancement Committee, the Executive Committee, and the Athletics Board of
Directors. He also volunteered to be a co-chair of the SU Giving Campaign,
which recently successfully finished at over $1.44 billion. Outside of Syracuse
University, Phanstiel currently serves as Chairman of United Online, a leading
provider of consumer products and services over the Internet, since November
2013 and as a director since October 2008.

                                    Learn from a diverse faculty, connecting across disciplines to assure that social
                                    sciences inform a public affairs career, and that scholarship never forgets the
                                    tangible ends it serves.

                                    and to the idea that well-educated public servants change the world.






                                    Connected to the World

                                    Benefit from frequent visiting leaders and intellectuals — and from our D.C. headquarters
                                    at CSIS, where you will connect to world difference makers.
