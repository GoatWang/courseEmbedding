When John Hill, Co-Founder of Holland Hill, was growing up, he worked for his father in sheet metal, and helped fabricate and install many copper roofs and hoods. This experience lead to John's creation of the Copper Bird Feeders now marketed by Holland Hill. Items made of copper are in effect heirlooms, as copper is malleable (it bends but doesn't break), and copper is extremely slow oxidizing (it doesn't rust). Plus copper provides beauty that deepens with age. Under the guidance of David and John, Holland Hill products are proudly made by craftsmen in the North America (Mexico, Missouri).

About "A Survey of the Old Testament"
        
        
            This college level textbook surveys the Old Testament by focusing its primary attention on the purpose and message of each book. 
- Koorong

This innovative textbook at long last provides an Old Testament survey for undergraduate students that goes beyond basic content. The book attempts to balance the literary, historical, and theological issues pertaining to each individual book and to the Old Testament as a whole. The main portion of the survey treats each book of the Old Testament in the order of the English canon. This information does not simply rehash the biblical material, but assumes that the Scriptures are being read alongside the survey. The book focuses its primary attention on the purpose and message of each book and attempts to show how the literary structure of each one has been used to accomplish the author's purpose. The survey also introduces readers to the issues of hermeneutics (general and special), history (Israelite and Near Eastern), archaeology, canon, geography, Old Testament theology (biblical and systematic), and critical methodologies. All these issues are dealt with in separate chapters at a basic introductory level that never allows the reader to lose sight, as it were, of the forest while wandering through the trees. In addressing critical issues of date and authorship, the survey avoids a polemical stance. Hill and Watson seek to depend on the evidence of the text rather than on presuppositions to substantiate their views. Their commitment to the authority of the biblical text results in a book that, while notably evangelical, is not always traditional. The authors approach the survey mindful of two complicating factors in Old Testament study. First, God's revelation did not come by way of the English language or through Western culture, and therefore we today have to work carefully to receive the message clearly. Second, even when we are listening, we have a tendency to be selective about what we hear or to try to make the message conform to our ideas. The solution is to allow the Bible to speak for itself. The informed reader will find much innovation here and a keen awareness of current scholarship relating to the Old Testament. Above all, this textbook will bring a new vigor and excitement to the Old Testament as readers learn to discover its story for themselves and see how to understand it as a substantial part of God's self-revelation to humankind. This survey is well illustrated with maps, charts, and photographs. Additional features are the questions for study and the annotated reading list at the end of each chapter.

Publisher's Description▼▲
The purpose of studying the Old Testament is to understand God and his redemptive work more fully. However, this goal is complicated by the fact that it was transmitted through a very different language and culture from our own. A Survey of the Old Testament provides an indispensable guide for undergraduate students and other readers by exploring the literary, historical, and theological issues behind the Old Testament and its various books. For each Old Testament book, the Survey addresses background information, purpose, message, structure, and major themes. Chapters introducing each major section of the Old Testament are included, as are chapters dealing with issues of interpretation, geography, archaeology, history, formation of the Old Testament canon, and the Old Testaments relationship to the New Testament. The text is enhanced throughout by maps, photos, timelines, and charts. This full-color third edition of a widely acclaimed textbook has been expanded and redesigned in both text and graphical elements, making it even more beneficial.


Author Bio▼▲

He is the coauthor with John Walton of A Survey of the Old Testament and the author of Malachi in the Anchor Bible commentary series.

            This text is a common choice for OT survey courses at the 100 level. As it goes, it is an acceptable text for such a course if not remarkable in any particular way. Hill & Walton strike an odd balance between modern critical scholarship and evangelical theology. I cannot give the highest rating to a text which hardly mentions the Deutero-canon except when briefly discussing canonical formation.

            This is a great study for old testament. Got it for my old testament survey class and have greatly benefited from it.

            This is a great textbook for studying the OT. It has excellent illustrations. It is a great research tool when studying the Old Testament. I highly recommend it for Bible Teachers, and Preachers, and Bible school/Seminary students. Also, anyone that has a desire to grow in the Lord!!

            Great to have this on my electronic devices for reference. It has helped me be prepared for interpreting in seminary classes.

                This review was written for A Survey of the Old Testament - eBook.
            
 
            I was disappointed. I purchased the book so I can use it in course and was not able to cut or paste. Then found out I could not return the book. I felt that I wasted my money. The next book I purchase will be a hard copy. I have not even read the book beyond the first couple of pages. Perhaps I will get to it after I've recovered from being peeved.


If I knew before purchase that I could not return the ebook I might have purchased the hard copy.
