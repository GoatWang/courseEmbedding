Boeing: Kevin G. McAllister is CEO
November 22, 2016

Boeing 
		Chairman, President and CEO Dennis Muilenburg named Kevin G. McAllister 
		president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, succeeding company 
		Vice Chairman Ray Conner in that role. Muilenburg also appointed Stanley 
		A. Deal president and CEO of Boeing Global Services, a new business unit 
		to be formed from the customer services groups within the company's 
		existing commercial airplanes and defense, space and security business 
		units. McAllister joins Boeing from GE Aviation. Deal is a veteran 
		Boeing executive.

		Conner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. 
		He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful 
		hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government 
		relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer 
		support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for 
		the company's transition to a single integrated services business and 
		remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial 
		Airplanes.



		"With Ray Conner's retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global 
		services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow 
		Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other 
		partners in the years ahead," said Muilenburg. "We are immensely 
		grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over 
		nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience 
		and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions 
		underway."

		McAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he 
		served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before 
		that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and 
		marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog 
		growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business.

		"Kevin is one of industry's best and most highly regarded senior 
		executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong 
		Commercial Airplanes team," Muilenburg said. "He's a passionate leader 
		with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows 
		Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the 
		results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this 
		vital and growing part of our company."

		Boeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently 
		within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & 
		Security's Global Services & Support group. While some defense and 
		commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing 
		business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced 
		services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing 
		subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.

		Deal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new 
		leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of 
		Boeing's Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive 
		years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and 
		general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing 
		Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, 
		Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an 
		engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior 
		roles in sales and marketing.

		"Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he's 
		ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to 
		expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market 
		worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years," Muilenburg 
		said. "Substantial services growth is core to Boeing's strategy as we 
		enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate 
		our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers."

		Deal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and 
		deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while 
		ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is 
		maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman 
		Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret 
		during the transition.

		Boeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the 
		company's third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a 
		small core headquarters group based in Dallas, where Aviall currently 
		has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional 
		leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the 
		work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at 
		existing locations for the foreseeable future.

		Deal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting 
		directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company's 
		Executive Council. The appointments are effective today.

		A materials engineer, McAllister joined GE in 1989 from aerospace 
		supplier Howmet Corporation, where he held various engineering 
		leadership roles in product design, manufacturing and technology 
		development. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh, he also is 
		chairman of the board of ORBIS International, a non-profit committed to 
		affordable, accessible and sustainable eye care worldwide.

		Conner has been corporate vice chairman since 2013, and president and 
		CEO of Commercial Airplanes since 2012. A 39-year company veteran who 
		started as a mechanic on the 727 program, he has held roles that span 
		production, program management, supply chain management, and sales and 
		marketing. A strong believer in the power of education, he has been a 
		driving force in efforts to equip local high school students with 
		technical skills applicable to good-paying aerospace manufacturing jobs 
		and in strengthening the ability of Washington state universities to 
		produce enough engineering and science graduates to maintain a vibrant 
		aerospace sector.











Commercial 
		Aviation Services, which Deal has led since 2014, has more than 12,000 
		employees worldwide, offering airlines and leasing companies the 
		industry's largest portfolio of support and services. These include 24/7 
		customer support, flight and maintenance training, aftermarket parts, 
		maintenance and engineering solutions, airplane conversions and 
		upgrades, flight planning, digital crew scheduling, advanced data 
		analytics and a wide range of solutions to enhance customer efficiency.

		Global Services & Support, with more than 13,000 employees in 295 
		locations, delivers a full-spectrum of offerings to military and 
		government customers worldwide, including training, supply chain 
		management, aircraft modernization, platform sustainment and data 
		optimization. The business is the U.S. Department of Defense's largest 
		performance-based logistics contractor and an industry leader in 
		providing sustainment solutions for Boeing and select non-Boeing 
		platforms.

Conner, 61, will continue to serve as Boeing vice chairman through 2017. He will work closely with McAllister in the months ahead on a purposeful hand-off of customer, supplier, and community and government relationships, and to ensure continuity of operations and customer support. Conner also will provide strategic oversight and guidance for the company’s transition to a single integrated services business and remain involved in ongoing product development strategy at Commercial Airplanes.
“With Ray Conner’s retirement timeline in sight and an expanding global services market to pursue, these moves will further strengthen and grow Boeing and better serve our customers, employees, shareholders and other partners in the years ahead,” said Muilenburg. “We are immensely grateful to Ray for his leadership and contributions to Boeing over nearly four decades, and we will continue to rely on his vast experience and keen insights in supporting the leadership and business transitions underway.”
McAllister, 53, joins Boeing after 27 years with GE Aviation, where he served since 2014 as president and CEO of GE Aviation Services. Before that, as vice president and general manager of global sales and marketing since 2008, he was credited with delivering record backlog growth for the nearly $25 billion GE business.
“Kevin is one of industry’s best and most highly regarded senior executives, and we are thrilled to have him join Boeing and our strong Commercial Airplanes team,” Muilenburg said. “He’s a passionate leader with decades of commercial aviation knowledge and experience. He knows Boeing well, shares our values and commitment to our people, and has the results-oriented operational and business experience needed to lead this vital and growing part of our company.”
Boeing Global Services will bring together core capabilities currently within Commercial Aviation Services and Boeing Defense, Space & Security’s Global Services & Support group. While some defense and commercial customer fleet support will remain within the two existing business units, the new unit will provide a broad portfolio of advanced services and incorporate the capabilities of various Boeing subsidiaries, including Aviall and Jeppesen.
Deal, 52, brings three decades of broad aerospace experience to his new leadership role. Since 2014 he has served as senior vice president of Boeing’s Commercial Aviation Services business, delivering consecutive years of record performance. Previously, he was vice president and general manager of Supply Chain Management and Operations for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, responsible for Supplier Management, Fabrication, Propulsion Systems and Quality groups. Deal joined the company as an engineer on the C-17 military aircraft program and also held senior roles in sales and marketing.
“Stan is an exceptionally capable and experienced leader, and he’s ideally prepared to stand up an integrated Boeing services business to expand our share of a global commercial and defense services market worth an estimated $2.5 trillion over the next 10 years,” Muilenburg said. “Substantial services growth is core to Boeing’s strategy as we enter our second century, and this move is a key enabler to accelerate our efforts and provide increasing value to our customers.”
Deal will begin immediately finalizing and executing detailed and deliberate plans to structure and organize the new business while ensuring all near-term customer commitments are met and value is maximized over the long term. He will work closely with Vice Chairman Conner and Defense, Space & Security President and CEO Leanne Caret during the transition.
Boeing Global Services is slated to begin fully operating as the company’s third major business unit by the third quarter of 2017, with a small core headquarters group based in Dallas, where Aviall currently has a sizeable presence. While specific business details and additional leadership assignments will be forthcoming, the vast majority of the work performed by Boeing Global Services is expected to remain at existing locations for the foreseeable future.
Deal and McAllister join Caret as business unit leaders reporting directly to Muilenburg. They also become members of the company’s Executive Council. The appointments are effective Nov. 21, 2016.
