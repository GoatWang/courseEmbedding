      Fitch Rates World Omni Automobile Lease Securitization Trust 2016-A
    





July 20, 2016 12:11 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to 
      the notes issued by World Omni Automobile Lease Securitization Trust 
      2016-A:
    

      --$117,000,000 Class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$426,000,000 Class A-2a/A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$305,000,000 Class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$93,282,000 Class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$45,445,000 Class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: 2016-A has a weighted average (WA) FICO score 
      of 732, a decrease from prior securitizations but consistent with a 
      prime portfolio. The base residual value percentage has decreased 
      marginally to 68.94% from 69.52% in WOLS 2015-A.
    

      Collateral Concentration Risks: The two largest models (Toyota Camry and 
      RAV4) total 39% of the portfolio in 2016-A compared to 45% for the two 
      largest models (Toyota Camry and Corolla) in 2015-A. Camry and RAV4 
      models have produced low residual value (RV) losses historically. While 
      the lease maturities in 2016-A are heavily concentrated at the end of 
      2018 and first half of 2019, the overall portfolio has a WA original 
      term of 37.6 months, in line with 2015-A.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) 
      is expected to be 17.65% and 13.65% of the initial securitization value 
      (SV) for the class A and B notes, respectively, growing to 19.15% and 
      15.15% of the initial SV. Fitch's 'BB' RV loss expectation is 9.30% of 
      base residual and Fitch's credit loss proxy is 0.85% of SV.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Quality of Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing Platform: World Omni 
      demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency, credit loss, and RV 
      loss performance of the managed portfolio and securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the notes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 135 sample 
      leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the 
      findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link at the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled ' World Omni Automobile 
      Lease Securitization Trust 2016-A -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
    
      Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings and Rating 
      Outlooks to the notes issued by World Omni Automobile Lease 
      Securitization Trust 2016-A:
    

      --Class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --Class A-2a/A-2b 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Class B 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: 2016-A has a weighted average (WA) FICO score 
      of 732, a decrease from prior securitizations, but consistent with a 
      prime portfolio. The base residual value percentage has decreased 
      marginally to 68.95% from 69.52% in WOLS 2015-A.
    

      Collateral Concentration Risks: The two largest models, Toyota Camry and 
      RAV4, total 39% of the portfolio compared to 45% for the two largest 
      models (Toyota Camry and Corolla) in 2015-A; these models have produced 
      low and infrequent RV losses. While the lease maturities in 2016-A are 
      heavily concentrated at the end of 2018 and in the first half of 2019, 
      the overall portfolio has a WA original term of 38 months, in line with 
      2015-A.
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement Structure: Initial credit enhancement (CE) 
      is expected to be 17.65% and 13.65% of the initial securitization value 
      (SV) for the class A and B notes, respectively, growing to 19.15% and 
      15.15% of the initial SV. Fitch's 'BB' residual value (RV) loss 
      expectation is 9.30% of base residual and Fitch's credit loss proxy is 
      0.85% of SV.
    

      Evolving Wholesale Market: The U.S. wholesale vehicle market has been 
      normalizing following strong performance in recent years. Fitch expects 
      that increasing off-lease vehicle supply and pressure from increased 
      production levels will lead to decreased residual realizations during 
      the life of the transaction.
    

      Quality of Origination, Underwriting, and Servicing Platform: World Omni 
      demonstrates adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and 
      servicer, as evidenced by historical delinquency, credit loss, and RV 
      loss performance of the managed portfolio and securitizations.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of World Omni would not impair the timeliness 
      of payments on the notes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated decreases in the value of returned vehicles and/or 
      increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted 
      receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base case and 
      would likely result in declines of CE and loss coverage levels available 
      to the notes. Hence, Fitch conducts sensitivity analyses by increasing 
      the transaction's initial base case RV and credit loss assumptions and 
      examining the rating implications on all classes of issued notes. The 
      increases to the base case losses are applied such that they represent 
      moderate (1.5x) and severe (2.5x) stresses, and are intended to provide 
      an indication of the rating sensitivity of notes to unexpected 
      deterioration of a trust's performance.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to 135 sample 
      leases. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the 
      findings did not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due 
      Diligence Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction 
      may be obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related 
      rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled ' World Omni Automobile 
      Lease Securitization Trust 2016-A -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared 
      to those of typical R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special 
      report 'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions' dated June 12, 2015.

NYT: Wells Fargo Pattern of Filing False Documents with Federal Court

livinglies.wordpress.com | June 15, 2017
It’s nice to see Gretchen Morgenson back on the beat of financial fraud. We need more exposure to what everyone who has battling foreclosures already knows — that virtually all of the documents relied upon by would-be foreclosers are false, fraudulent, fabricated and forged. These revelations appear to be the only way judges will stop allowing presumptions of false facts to dominate their rulings.

Most U.S. Homes are Worth Less than Before the Crash

You can't blame a homeowner in Fresno, Calif., for viewing the thriving metropolis to its northwest with both envy and dismay.  While San Francisco home values have surged since the recession, Fresno's housing market is stuck in a rut. Less than 3% of homes in the city and its environs have returned to their pre&hyphen;recession peak, according to a new study from Trulia. Median home values are a teeth&hyphen;clenching &dollar;78,000 below their pre&hyphen;recession peak.

Resecuritization
livinglies.wordpress.com | March 7, 2017 As predicted on my blog back in 2008, we are seeing new names of Trusts emerge in foreclosure cases — involving old loans that were declared in default years ago by parties asserting they represent the alleged servicer of either a named bank or servicer or an old trust. What happened? As our sources had revealed, the alleged trusts had nothing in them and were the source of extreme liability of the Master Servicer acting as underwriter to the investors and third parties who traded in securities based upon the representation that the Trust actually owned the debts of millions of homeowners.

Citigroup’s Crime Spree Against Americans Continues With Slaps on the Wrist
livinglies.wordpress.com | February 14, 2017 Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged two units of the Wall Street mega bank, Citigroup, with insidious fraudulent acts against homeowners while it imposed a modest $28.8 million in relief and penalties. The penalty portion of $7.4 million is meaningless because this is a bank that serially breaks the law, laughs at its regulators, and, most outrageously, it was simultaneously engaging in heinous misdeeds against Americans while the U.S. government was using taxpayer money to bail out its failed business model of brazen financial frauds. The $7.4 million in fines also stands in contrast to the $14.9 billion that Citigroup reported as net income for 2016.

Governor Cuomo Announces $28 Million Fine Levied Against PHH Mortgage Corporation for Shoddy Mortgage Origination and Servicing Practices 
stopforeclosurefraud.com | November 14, 2016
Governor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that PHH Mortgage Corporation and its affiliate, PHH Home Loans LLC, will pay a $28 million fine and engage a third-party auditor as part of a consent order for violations of federal and New York laws designed to protect homeowners. The consent order between the two companies and the Department of Financial Services was reached following a series of examinations that uncovered persistent shortcomings in their mortgage origination and servicing practices, including discrepancies in how mortgage foreclosures were documented and processed.

Casting Doubt on Validity of Servicer Affidavits in Foreclosure Litigation 
livinglies.wordpress.com | November 4, 2016
Most institutional lenders, trusts and large financial institutions that loan money to borrowers or acquire distressed loans use loan servicers to service their loans after the loans are originated or otherwise assigned to them. Loan servicing is the process by which a lender uses a third party to, among other things, collect principal, interest and escrow payments from the borrower in connection with a loan.

Wells Fargo in Talks With Prosecutors Over Potential Mortgage Abuses

              Wells Fargo & Co. is in talks with a group of federal and state prosecutors examining potential abuses related to mortgages as it continues to grapple with investigations and public outrage from its sales-practices scandal. The bank disclosed in its most recent quarterly securities filing posted Thursday that it is in discussions with the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force. That group, which includes the Justice Department, has levied billions of dollars in fines on other big U.S. banks, including a $16.65 billion payout from Bank of America Corp. and $13 billion from J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

Double Blind Foreclosure Scheme is Working for the Banks: States Quietly Resetting Title Across the Board 
livinglies.wordpress.com | November 3, 2016
The plain fact is that if homes were fraudulently foreclosed based upon void fabricated instruments, the foreclosure itself is void. That is what is true under current law. But states like Massachusetts have passed legislation that most homeowners neither know about nor understand. Their rights to possession and title to property that is still legally owned by them (if current law was applied) are again being foreclosed legislatively. This completes the bank scheme in which the TBTF banks received a windfall "profit" in the trillions that really was a double blind fraudulent scheme. Both investors and homeowners alike are the victims while the TBTF banks are the victors.

Are We Heading for Another Housing Crisis?
money.usnews.com | May 12, 2016
                Ten years ago, a storm was brewing in the housing market. Lenders were handing out mortgages seemingly to anyone who applied, and in many cases, borrowers weren't asked for documentation to prove income. Some institutions rolled out adjustable-rate mortgages that featured teaser rates and were marketed to consumers as loans that could be easily refinanced before the interest rate was scheduled to reset and send payments into the stratosphere.

California high court opens door to wrongful foreclosure suits 
latimes.com | March 6, 2016 
                During the bust that followed last decade's housing boom, hundreds of thousands of Californians lost their homes to foreclosure. It was a process later found to be rife with problems, such as overwhelmed bank employees who sometimes didn't even read the foreclosure documents in front of them. But challenging foreclosures on the basis of paperwork problems proved to be mostly futile, given California courts had ruled that borrowers who weren't paying their mortgages didn't suffer financial harm.

The Banks Business Model is Foreclosing on Homeowners 
March 2, 2016 
                Securitization is the reason banks want homeowners to foreclose. When a bank assigns the risk of a loan to the investors (certificate holders) of a Real Estate Investment Conduit Trust (SPV), the “bank” is no longer a traditional bank that gets the benefit of mortgage payments. Mortgage banks give as few modifications as possible and comply minimally with statutes put in place to protect borrowers, all while employing tricks to “cash in” on homeowners’ defaults, pushing them to foreclosure.

$5.4 Million! Jury Finds Wells Fargo Committed Fraud When It Used Robo-Signed Document 
i-uv.com | December 14, 2015
                Congratulations to the experts and attorneys on this. As Marie McDonnell states in the article reproduced below this case is important because it is the first time that Robo-signing has resulted in an award of damages for fraud. I would add that the lawyers must have done a fine job at trial — because ordinarily we don’t see jury instructions that would support punitive damages for robo-signing. The pages are turning on a new chapter.

Florida Court Rules Bank of America Must Pay Homeowner 6 Years of Attorney Fees on Dismissed Foreclosure Lawsuit

PALM BEACH Fla. — America's most&hyphen;hated bank lost back&hyphen;to&hyphen;back court motions on Friday when a judge ordered Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) to pay Author TJ Fisher's 2009&hyphen;2014 attorney fees on a dismissed foreclosure lawsuit. The bank's bill is expected to total more than $60,000, court documents reflect. The Goliath bank's recent court loss is unlikely to garner much public sympathy, according to national polls and indexes. The bank consistently tops the list as one of the country's most despised banks and companies.

Proof of Standing Required: Seffar v. Residential Credit Solutions Inc

livinglies.wordpress.com | July 5, 2017
It is NOT enough to ALLEGE standing. They must PROVE it. 
Judges across the country are making mistakes with this simple concept. Standing to SUE is presumed if you allege (in words or by incorporation of 
exhibits) that you have it. Possession of the “original note” can be alleged but at trial the foreclosing party must PROVE (not argue) that 
(1) they have the original note and (2) they have the right to enforce it either because they own it or because they have been authorized by a person who owns 
it or a person who has the right to enforce it.

Investors and borrowers were thus left in a transaction they didn’t know existed and without any documentation to show for it. MERS was essential to 
fill that void with the creation of fabricated written instruments that appear to be facially valid.

Foreclosure Prevention is Paying Off Claim the GSEs

livinglies.wordpress.com | June 25, 2017
The GSEs claim to have prevented more than 49,000 foreclosures in the first quarter, an increase of nearly 5,000 preventions compared to Q4, according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Q1 Foreclosure Prevention Report.  Unfortunately, the majority of these loans that were prevented from being foreclosed upon were held by parties that had no evidence of standing or ownership, and therefore had no right to negotiate.

NYT: Wells Fargo Pattern of Filing False Documents with Federal Court

It’s nice to see Gretchen Morgenson back on the beat of financial fraud. We need more exposure to what everyone who has battling foreclosures already knows — that virtually all of the documents relied upon by would-be foreclosers are false, fraudulent, fabricated and forged. These revelations appear to be the only way judges will stop allowing presumptions of false facts to dominate their rulings.

Homeowners trying to receive evidence of the money trail are stonewalled from obtaining the documents that would help them to prove their case and prevail.  Discovery is often blocked on ordinary grounds or on the basis of relevance.  Therefore Discovery must be executed with precision, caution and as part of the record.  Both the money trail and the paper trail matter, but revealing the money trail is much more difficult because in that discovery lies the smoking gun.

PMI Insurance: Coverage, Overcharges, Kickbacks and Maybe a Duty to Mitigate Losses — and Article 3 Standing in a Nutshell

Besides the obvious violation of RESPA, I see another hidden issue — the duty to mitigate damages imposed on all "injured parties."

Mortgage Crisis 2.0: BofA CEO Wants to Slash Down Payments to Help Poor Millennials

livinglies.wordpress.com | May 20, 2017

Among a host of other issues, one of the critical things that contributed to the housing crisis of 2008 was the fact that speculative borrowers had nearly no “skin in the game.”  Anyone who decided they wanted a piece of the rapidly inflating housing bubble could go out and buy multiple houses with no money down or, in some cases, even do “cash out” purchases whereby banks would finance more than 100% of the purchase price leaving ‘buyers’ to pocket the excess.

Default, Foreclosure and the Impact on Physical and Mental Health Function

by K.K. MacKinstry/LendingLies Blog


Neuroscientists have concluded that chronic stress and cortisol damage the brain.  Although there are no formal studies to date on the health ramifications of default, prolonged litigation, and post-foreclosure trauma, it would be safe to conclude that people who are exposed to chronic stress over an extended period of time are prone to mental issues like anxiety and mood disorders as well as physical illnesses.  The most common mental disorders in protracted litigation are post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression that unfortunately result in altered brain structure and chemistry.

Powell v. Wells Fargo: The Party Seeking Foreclosure must Demonstrate that it has Standing to Foreclose
livinglies.wordpress.com | April 25, 2017
             In this case the Bank was required to prove a chain of transfers starting with the indorsee, GreenPoint Mortgage to the current servicer.  The Bank failed to prove the series of transactions through which it purportedly acquired the note from the indorsee and the judge ordered an involuntary dismissal.  However, because this is Florida and statute of limitations are not upheld, it is likely that Wells Fargo will have time to regroup, create a new strategy, and file to foreclose again on the tortured homeowners.

Resecuritization
livinglies.wordpress.com | March 7, 2017 As predicted on my blog back in 2008, we are seeing new names of Trusts emerge in foreclosure cases — involving old loans that were declared in default years ago by parties asserting they represent the alleged servicer of either a named bank or servicer or an old trust. What happened? As our sources had revealed, the alleged trusts had nothing in them and were the source of extreme liability of the Master Servicer acting as underwriter to the investors and third parties who traded in securities based upon the representation that the Trust actually owned the debts of millions of homeowners.

Citigroup’s Crime Spree Against Americans Continues With Slaps on the Wrist
livinglies.wordpress.com | February 14, 2017 Last week, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) charged two units of the Wall Street mega bank, Citigroup, with insidious fraudulent acts against homeowners while it imposed a modest $28.8 million in relief and penalties. The penalty portion of $7.4 million is meaningless because this is a bank that serially breaks the law, laughs at its regulators, and, most outrageously, it was simultaneously engaging in heinous misdeeds against Americans while the U.S. government was using taxpayer money to bail out its failed business model of brazen financial frauds. The $7.4 million in fines also stands in contrast to the $14.9 billion that Citigroup reported as net income for 2016.

Trump’s Treasury pick says his bank didn’t ‘robo-sign.’ These court papers say it did.
thinkprogress.org | February 8, 2017 
              Before he was picked by President Trump to lead the Treasury Department, Steve Mnuchin ran a bank named OneWest, which foreclosed on tens of thousands of homeowners under his leadership. After his Senate hearing, he was asked specifically about the practice of robo-signing, which entails mortgage officials rapidly signing off on hundreds or thousands of foreclosure documents without verifying that the information is accurate or giving it a thorough review as required by law. Thus a bank can speed up the foreclosure process and, in some cases, get courts to let it take possession of a property with a full trial.

RESCISSION: It’s time for another slap on the wrist for state and federal judges

50 years ago Congress decided to slap punitive measures on lenders who ignore or attempt to go around (table-funded loans) existing laws on required disclosures --- instead of creating a super agency that would review every loan closing before it could be consummated. So it made the punishment so severe that only the stupidest lenders would attempt to violate Federal law. That worked for a while --- until the era of securitization fail. (Adam Levitin's term for illusion under the cloak of false securitization).

Are mortgage-backed securities backed by any guarantees? 
tradebuddy.online.com | January 31, 2017 
Actually, any mortgage-backed security (MBS) guarantee depends on who issued it. To review, an MBS is a security, created through the process of securitization, in which the underlying assets are loans made to individuals and companies who are using the funds to purchase buildings and homes. The mortgages are secured to the lender by the properties purchased by the borrowers and are often backed by some form of homeowners’ insurance. However, this insurance will only protect the issuer of the mortgages (mortgagee), and not the owners of an MBS that is issued using the same underlying mortgage. Therein lies part of the risk to MBS investors.

In 2011, unemployment was at a near crisis level. The jobless rate was stuck around 9 percent nationally, an unusually high number due to the continuing effects of the financial crash. House Democrats were aghast. “With almost five unemployed Americans for every job opening, too many people remain jobless because of a lack of work, not a lack of wanting to work,” said Congressman Lloyd Doggett, D-Tex. So in early November 2011, they introduced a bill to reauthorize Federal unemployment benefits, an insurance program designed to aide those looking for work.

Lawsuit Seeking Disgorgement Might Not Be Barred by Statute of Limitations

What is apparent here is that the Courts are coming to terms with the possibility that those relying upon a statute of limitation as a defense to various claims might NOT be protected by an otherwise applicable statute of limitations. The premise enunciated in a decision that seeks affirmation from the U.S. Supreme Court, is that disgorgement is not monetary damages or a penalty. It is an equitable finding that a party has been unjustly enriched and therefore has no present right to hold onto ill-gotten gains. The decision could result in elimination of the statute of limitations as a defense for the banks.

A new non-prime mortgage market is beginning to emerge in the U.S., almost 10 years after the subprime and Alt-A mortgage markets shut down amid dramatic underperformance. Fitch Ratings expects a notable increase in newly originated non-prime RMBS activity in 2017, though on a significantly smaller scale and with a higher credit quality than pre-crisis origination volume.

"Chase agreed to settle for only PART of the property tax owed. The bankruptcy court approved the settlement agreement so It is a done deal. Once I submitted your audit, in my amended objection to their proof of claim, they started talking about a settlement. Anyway, I am interested in taking your three day course at a future date. Thanks again."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
