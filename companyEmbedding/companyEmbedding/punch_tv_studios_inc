Key Thoughts for Filmmakers: 






Warren Jobs has come out and said that this is a great opportunity to be part of a movie making system that works. With this development, as an independent movie maker, you will no longer have to stand alone. The outcome of this event will help filmmakers to not only get the budget, but also, they will be able to use the other resources and logistical support in every aspect of the film production that the company has to offer. 
We are focused on programming for the New Urban markets.  Punch TV Studios is seeking to partner with Independent filmmakers to develop all genres of films and television shows, including action, drama, mystery, family, documentary, music, comedy
There is also the chance of filmmakers being able to become a shareholder in Punch TV Studios because as the company grows they also grow whether or not they make a movie or sell a script. As a shareholder that doubles up as a filmmaker, you will get preferential treatment in being able to pitch their projects and they will get priority treatment regarding funding, distribution and other resources. Punch TV Studios is selling 50 million shares of stock at $1.00 per share.
When the Punch TV Studios stock offering is successful we intend to fund our first one hundred films. Our company will spend up to $10 million to develop film productions with budgets up to $100,000.00

Is Punch TV Studios’ IPO the Next Alibaba? EurPublisherNovember 19, 2014Press ReleaseTelevisionTV/Radio/Film/TheaterUrban Business2 Comments4880 views


*(Compton, CA) – The multimedia television entity, Punch TV Studios (stock symbol URBT:OTC), has opened its doors to become a publicly traded company.  Situated in Compton, CA, Punch TV Studios has become the bellwether for the future of media, aspiring to reach initial public offering feats that haven’t been seen since the likes of Alibaba.
Notable parallels have been drawn between Punch TV Studios and Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce company that earlier this year had the largest stock offering in history. Punch TV Studios has positioned itself to be the dominant player in the television market by bringing equally diverse content to its viewers.
Small Business Association (SBA) Entrepreneur of the Year Award Winner, and C.E.O. of Punch TV Studios, Joseph Collins, stated that “New networks are needed to satisfy the tastes and viewing interests of these highly segmented niche of consumers. My vision is to build a multibillion dollar media company that is primarily owned by members of the urban communities around the globe.”
Punch TV Studios takes pride in its Compton, CA location considering that the city has found itself to be a figurative pulse of Black America. It also serves as a metaphorical home for urban struggles nationally. The election of their youngest Mayor, Aja Brown, was merely another signifier of the City’s forward-thinking drive that feeds the energy of ambitious pursuits such as Punch TV Studios’ recent stock offering announcement.
In a similar spirit of intent, Punch TV Studios molds its content, as Alibaba did with products, to become a platform that represents a cacophony of ideals, bringing original stories by the people of America for the people of the world, while simultaneously reaping the potential for a record-breaking global stock offering on a grassroots level.
By utilizing state of the art technology in television, film, and music, Punch TV Studios brings digital technology into new areas not yet seen with other television networks, including 4D technology and a signal with the ability to broadcast on multiple platforms from television to Internet; from ipads & tablets to iphone & android phones.
In an interview with Producer, Director Sid Burston, who plans to develop new content with Punch TV Studios, he states, “Punch TV Studios is rapidly becoming the home for new Producers, Directors and Writers. It allows untold stories to be brought to film, television, cellphones, tablets and other media.”
A trans-media entity that breaches new areas of technology and diversity, Punch TV Studios is positioned to revive the character and importance of niche television broadcasting with the same open-sesame approach as Alibaba. Developing an abundance of new programs and amenities, its stock offering is expected to change the market in ways perhaps never before seen.

COMPTON, Calif., May 5, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Punch TV Studios and URBT (OTC:URBT) today announced the launch of their revolutionary new breakthrough technology, "Punch TV Live", the proprietary media platform for digital broadcasting. Punch TV Live allows for the digital distribution of high definition live streaming of multiple television networks, while seamlessly delivering content to urban viewers. The revolutionary new media platform introduces Punch TV Studios to a global audience, affirming its ability to dominate the urban market space.

	The Punch TV Live technology provides a platform for viewers to evolve into the "TV Everywhere" concept, by giving them the ability to watch television on any device; including desktop computers, mobile phones, tablets and social media websites. Punch TV Studios currently broadcasts its namesake channel Punch TV, via the Punch TV Live technology on http://www.PunchTVStudios.com. Punch TV Live is the first step towards the company launching over 100 independent television networks on the "Punch TV Live App" which is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2016.  

	The announcement of this revolutionary broadcast platform is only one of many new additions Punch TV Studios and URBT CEO Joseph Collins has planned. Since taking over URBT in October of 2014, Joseph Collins has concentrated on seeking innovative, technology-based strategies to breathe new life into the company. Collins' primary focus is developing advancements in the way the company delivers its signal and aggregates content, placing the company on the fast track to being the stand-out leader in the urban television marketplace.

	"This is an exciting opportunity for our company and URBT stockholders," says Joseph Collins, "In the 1980's URBT became the first minority certified broadcasting company, and now we have implemented cutting edge technology that will revolutionize streaming television for the new urban American. We are breaking barriers in television!"

	Punch TV Studios "Are you thirsty yet?"
