All About Liquor

Unless you're lining up a bunch of shots, liquor takes a little more work than cracking a beer or pouring a glass of wine. However, the effort is well worth the result if you've picked up the right bottle. Enjoy the sophisticated complexity of whiskey all on its own or create an amazing gin cocktail. Impress your guests with a digestif or get the party started with a batch of margaritas. You can find a different liquor brand or cocktail to suit every occasion. Plus, being able to whip up a delicious cocktail will never not impress your guests.
Whiskey:
With a diverse array of flavors, you can try a different whiskey or bourbon every night and never get bored. It tastes great straight from the glass, though you can dress it up with flavored soda, sparkling water or other mixers. Try light and dark whiskeys to experience the full spectrum of notes, from fruity and light to bitter, spicy and dark.
Vodka:
Although higher-end vodka can taste wonderful straight from the shot glass or tumbler, it's perfect for cocktails. When you crave spicy, whip up a batch of bloody marys — and don't skimp on the hot sauce. A vodka martini tastes great with a few olives, while a Cosmopolitan will satisfy anyone with a sweet tooth and a penchant for "Sex and the City" marathons.
Tequila:
It's best known for its inclusion in popular cocktails, from margaritas and tequila sunrises to Joan Collinses and tequila sours. It's also perfect as an apéritif when mixed with simple tonic. Choose a lighter-colored tequila for this cocktail, and don't forget to add plenty of crushed ice.
Brandy:
If you want to impress someone, keep a bottle of good brandy on hand. It's best served neat in a well-rounded snifter, though a simple tumbler works too. To experience the full array of rich flavors, hold the glass between your hands to warm the liquid inside. Like wine, brandy often tastes best after you take a good whif, so don't forget to sniff before you lift the glass to your lips.
Gin:
This humble liquor has been popular for centuries thanks to its fairly simple taste. If you're planning a party, collect the recipe ingredients necessary for gin martinis, gimlets, Tom Collinses, and Singapore slings. Of course, it also tastes great with a splash of soda on the rocks.
Start searching around to buy liquor online, whether it's a fancy bottle to impress your in-laws or some mini liquor bottles to take on your next flight.

All About Wine

Whether you're dedicated to your signature wines or you're looking for a new bottle that'll blow your mind, you'll find all the wine you've ever dreamed of right here. Find out why we consider ourselves a wine lover's paradise and discover why Drizly is the best place to shop for everything from your everyday table wine to your special occasion bottles.
Red Wines:
If you can't tell a Syrah from a Cabernet Sauvignon or a Rioja from a Bordeaux, there still might be hope for you yet. Discover the cherry and cassis notes in a great bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon or start sipping an easy-to-drink Merlot. But don't just stay in the Old World — go beyond just France and try some of our bestselling bottles of Australian Shiraz, Argentinian Malbec and Spanish Rioja.
White Wines:
If you've never met a glass of white wine you didn't love, start sipping your way through our vast selection to find your new fave. From full-bodied Chardonnay to crisp Riesling to refreshing Pinot Grigio, we have the perfect bottle so you can make your own happy hour. Try bottles of Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand or South Africa, Chardonnay from California or Australia or Gewürztraminer from Germany or France. You'll totally feel like a world traveler just from your couch!
Sparkling Wines:
Whether you're celebrating an anniversary, a major milestone at work or just the end of a great day, you need the perfect sparkling wine. For the uninitiated, bubbly goes way beyond Champagne. Sure, this French varietal is the most famous type of sparkling wine. But if you'd rather try a pleasant Prosecco or a Catalonian Cava, we have just the bottle of bubbly for you. A popped cork makes your day more poppin'. True story.
Rosé Wines:
On a warm summer day, nothing hits the spot like a glass of rosé. Don't be scared off by the color — real heroes love pink. Try a dry, full-bodied bottle from Côtes de Provence and feel like you're that much closer to your dream of horseback riding through the French countryside. Or save a bottle of sparkling rosé for when you really need your special occasion to stand out from all those other basic bubblies.
Dessert Wines:
The next time you want to finish your meal with a little something sweet, skip that crème brûlée and go for a glass of dessert wine instead. Know you're the classiest person around with a glass of Port and Sherry, or sweeten the deal with our extensive selection of Amontillado or yes, even Vermouth.

All About Beer

It's good to have beers around. In the fridge. At the office. In the cooler. Not so much in the car. But almost everywhere else. It's like a comfort blanket for adults. And there are so many different beer types, you'll never get bored. Fancy beers, cheap beers, flavorful beers, light beers—they've all got their time and place. That place mostly being in our hearts.
Top Trending Styles of Beer:
IPA:
If you dig hops, India Pale Ale is your beer. Legend says British brewers packed extra hops into beer before the long voyage to India. Is it true? Who cares? Drink it. IPAs vary from a gentle hop handshake to a sock in the eye. Dry-hopped versions are made from preserved hops and are sharper. Fresh/wet hopped brews are made right after harvest, featuring a more floral nose and hints of apricot.
Lager:
The classic golden brew from bottom-fermenting yeast is typically clean and light in flavor. Clarity is its trademark, but some include dark caramelized malt that produces a black lager mellower than porter or stout. Rare India Pale Lagers feature big hop aromas but finish softer than their ale cousins. However, most lagers are easy-drinking fishing brews that defy beer snobbery, pair nicely with each other and are served best in a cooler full of ice.
Cider:
While cider is jumping out of nowhere in the U.S., it's always been big in the UK, which is the world's biggest cider consumer. They can be made from any kind of apple, and even pears, but high-sugar cider apples are best. They range from crystal clear to murky and brown. Most sparkle, but some are still. Cider is a good choice for those concerned about wheat. Be sure to choose a pure one not blended with ale.
Ale:
"Pale" refers to the color of malt, as opposed to "amber" or "dark." Malt dried slowly without caramelization is pale. The drying process was tough to control centuries ago, so heavily roasted malts were the rule. Now pale malts are easier to make. They produce beers that balance full body and crisp refreshment. Pale ales sparked the American microbrewery revolution of the past couple of decades. Although not born here, pale ales are now as American as hot dogs.
Stout:
The baby born of deeply caramelized malt, stout is dark as a black hole with a full mouthfeel and a head you can chew. They range from creamy/chocolatey/malty to cocoa/espresso/tobacco. While some are as strong as they look with ABV of over 8 percent, others are deceptively light. The most famous stout, Guinness, has less alcohol and fewer calories than most golden brews, making it the perfect lunch beverage. Nitrogenization gives it a velvety texture.
Beer Myths 101:

Cold to warm and back again will skunk beer: Nope. Temperature won't corrupt your beer, but light will. If you're running out of room in the fridge, feel free to remove some beers without worrying. Just don't store them in your trunk during the summer.
Bottles > Cans: Again, nope. We just talked about this. Light is bad for your beer and cans are better at keeping it out. They're also better at keeping oxygen out, which is also no friend of beer.
Stouts are heavy and boozy: Appearances can be deceiving. Stouts might look like a lot to handle, but they're surprisingly light. Guinness actually has less calories and alcohol than Budweiser.
