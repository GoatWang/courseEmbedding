MINNEAPOLIS, May 30, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- In an effort to increase its European presence and better capture global opportunities, Whitebox Advisors, a $2.3 bn asset manager based in Minneapolis, announced today the opening of its new office in London, England.  
Simon Waxley, an industry veteran will join the Whitebox London office as Senior Portfolio Manager and will work closely with Whitebox's existing team of distinguished portfolio managers and global heads of trading.  
"We are excited to open the London office and to have someone as renowned as Simon Waxley on board," said Whitebox Advisors Founder and CEO, Andrew Redleaf. "Simon's industry expertise and presence on the ground will be an invaluable asset as we explore European opportunities."
Mr. Waxley's career includes a most recent position as Partner with W Partners in London where he focused on event driven, special situations primarily in Europe and Asia. Prior to W Partners, Waxley served as Managing Director for Perry Partners, Managing Director for Elliott Associates, and other notable positions.
"Whitebox Advisors has an exceptional team of investment professionals, a philosophy for investing that I believe is unmatched, and a stellar reputation for smart, idea-driven investing," said Waxley. "I am thrilled to join Whitebox as they move further into the European relative value and event markets."
In addition to the new London office, Whitebox, which is headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, has offices in Austin, TX and Singapore.
