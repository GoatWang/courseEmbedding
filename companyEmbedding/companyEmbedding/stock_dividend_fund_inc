                Introducing The Future of Dividend Growth
            

DGRW: WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund


Large technology companies are often today's economic leaders - creating the products and services that quickly become necessities. It might surprise you to learn that these companies have also been leading the way in dividend growth. And if your dividend fund uses a backward-looking growth screen, you probably won't be able to take advantage of these dividend growth trends for 5, 10 or even 20 years. DGRW, the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund, is a forward-looking ETF that seeks to help you capture today's dividend growth trends.

How We Weight By Dividends


How We Weight By Dividends

While the majority of ETFs are market cap-weighted — meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals - WisdomTree has developed a proprietary index methodology designed to magnify the effect fundamentals have on risk and return characteristics.

The WisdomTree Dividend Indexes typically weight each stock eligible for inclusion by its share of the Dividend Stream®, defined as the sum of regular cash dividends paid by all the companies in the respective Index.

DGRS - WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Dividend Growth








































































                        We believe small companies have big potential. Not only do they tend to outperform their larger counterparts over long periods of time, but historically they also tend lead the way out of recessions. Additionally, many small companies offer dividends that make them highly desirable to investors seeking income. Now, for the first time, WisdomTree brings you a forward-looking dividend growth exchange-traded fund (ETF) that helps enable you to capture the potential of small-cap dividend payers. DGRS, the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Dividend Growth Fund, looks at current—and future—dividend potential to help investors gain exposure to the small companies that grow their dividends the fastest.

Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.

4

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Christine Benz: Hi, I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com. Ever since the financial crisis, investors have been in love with dividends. Joining me to discuss some of his favorite dividend-focused funds is Russ Kinnel. He is director of manager research for Morningstar.
Russ, thank you so much of being here.
Russ Kinnel: Good to be here.
Benz: Russ, before we get into these specific fund picks, let's talk about the general case for dividend payers--why you might want to make room for them in your portfolio.
Kinnel: I think dividend-paying stocks offer a couple of advantages, the obvious one being income in a world where there isn't much income to be had. But also, there are some nice defensive characteristics. They tend to be kind of dull stocks that are just steady--obviously, things like utilities and others. And generally--not always, but generally--higher-yielding stocks tend to hold up well in a down market.
In the 2000-02 bear market, we saw them hold up beautifully. In the 2008-09 bear market, it was a much more mixed picture because some of those yield payers were financials, which obviously got hit very hard in that market.
Benz: Right. Let's discuss the role of costs in any sort of dividend-focused fund that you might buy. How are the two interconnected? Because I noticed that all of the fund picks that you're going to recommend really do have quite low costs relative to their peer groups.
Kinnel: A fund pays out income after expenses. So, those expenses actually come from its yield, if it has sufficient yield to cover expenses. Comparing two similar portfolios--one has a 1% expense ratio, the other has a 10-basis-point expense ratio--the cheaper one is going to have a yield of 90 basis points more. So, there is a very direct link there.
Read Full Transcript
Benz: It's not surprising that you've got a lot of Vanguard funds on your list of favorite dividend-focused funds. Let's start with Vanguard Dividend Growth (VDIGX)--the case for this fund and how its dividend-growth strategy is not all that income-centric, because I think sometimes people think "dividend" means it will have a high payout. [But that's not necessarily the case] with this particular fund or any dividend-growth-focused fund.
Kinnel: Right. The basic idea for dividend growth is that you are looking for companies that have a dividend and have the potential to grow that dividend. In order to grow the dividend, it means you have to have a good balance sheet and some growing revenues. So, it takes you away from utilities and into more high-quality companies with good balance sheets. So, it gives you a little different [mix] of companies. As you say, the yield isn't as great; but on the other hand, the appreciation potential is greater. And we saw in '08 that these funds actually did better than the equity-income-type funds because the balance sheets were so important in '08. These companies held up better in that downturn.
Benz: Let's discuss this particular fund. It is managed by Wellington Management for Vanguard. Let's talk about the management team and the general strategy in play here.
Kinnel: So, Don Kilbride of Wellington runs this fund. They have done just a great job of looking for companies with that dividend-appreciation potential, and you can see the record. It looks great against large-blend funds and against most index funds, including index funds focused on dividend appreciation. So, it's really worked well. And what I love about Vanguard is that their active funds are almost as cheap as their index funds. So, again, you are getting what dividends there are in this strategy to flow through because expenses are about 31 basis points, which is incredibly cheap. So, it is a really good value.
Benz: Vanguard also has, though, an index fund that uses kind of a similar strategy. Let's talk about that one--that's Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VDAIX). People can buy the traditional mutual fund. They can also buy an exchange-traded fund version. Let's talk about that general approach with the fund.
Kinnel: That's right. So, you are going to save some money versus the actively managed fund. You will save about 10 or 15 basis points; it's not a huge amount, but it's still cheaper. It gives you a little better potential yield. So, the new class of index funds that I really am drawn to are ones like this where there is a logic behind it. It's not too niche-y; it's still a broad-market focus, but it's focused on companies with dividend-appreciation potential--and again, a lot of those are things you can divine from the financial statements. So, it can be a basic rules-based index fund. And again, you have low costs and it really raises the bar, I think, on all dividend-growth funds, both active and passive.
Benz: Another fund that you like--before we leave the dividend-growth strategies--is T. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fund (PRDGX). Let's talk about it. I assume it has a pretty similar strategy to the ones that we've just talked about.
Kinnel: That's right. It's maybe even a little less income-focused than the two Vanguard funds, but it's still looking for income and appreciation. So, in a way, it's almost like the old-school growth-and-income funds. But again, it has done a really nice job. Tom Huber has been the manager since 2000. So, you have a very experienced manager looking for dividends and appreciation potential. Very much a nice core holding.
Benz: In the past, I know one of our favorite equity-income dividend-focused funds was T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund (RRFDX). Why isn't that at the top of your list here?
Kinnel: Brian Rogers is stepping down from that fund, and so it loses a bit of its appeal. Also, its performance wasn't quite as good as the other funds that we are going to mention in the equity-income space. It's still a very good fund--a nice, predictable, dependable fund.
Benz: Let's segue away from the dividend-growth strategies into funds that do specifically look to deliver a reasonable payout--that's part of the thesis and play. So, a starting point would be just a good index product like Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index (VHDYX). Let's talk about that.
Kinnel: That's right. This is a fund where the index is skewed toward higher-yielding companies. Obviously, you don't want to skew too heavily because the highest yielders tend to have some big risks involved. But again, this is a really nice way--with very low costs--to tap into yield-paying stocks. I think it's a nice way to get in there. And obviously, it's very predictable and dependable because you know what it's going to buy.
Benz: Then, another fund that has also been pretty predictable, uses a similarly income-focused strategy, that's Vanguard Equity-Income (VEIPX). Let's talk about what's going on there.
Kinnel: That's right. This fund is almost as cheap as its index equivalent from Vanguard. You're only paying a couple of basis points more. So, there's tremendous value coming from this fund. Two thirds of it is run by Wellington's Michael Reckmeyer and then one third by Vanguard's quant group. Vanguard's quant group has actually been steadily, quietly improving the performance they deliver for shareholders. So, the combination is a really nice one. Again, it's not designed to be thrilling. This is a fairly diffuse portfolio that's going to deliver steady income with a moderate amount of risk; but it has actually beaten its index-fund counterpart, and you're only paying 2 basis points more for it. So, certainly, there is potential that it will continue to outperform.
Benz: So, what's the idea with having the quant group run a component of this portfolio? Is the goal to bring down the overall costs of the fund or to improve returns? What are the main objectives?
Kinnel: Right. So, it does bring down the costs. [Second,] they tend to use the quant group to diversify the portfolio a little more, so it will reduce some of the individual-stock risk, some of the sector risk probably, too. So, it does that. And then, third, it also gives them a little more flexibility on capacity. So, if a lot of money comes in, maybe they can give a little more of that to the quant group. So, there are a few factors involved in using them. And as I said, I think, over time, they have gradually improved the quality of their efforts.
Benz: Russ, there's such an appetite for dividend-paying stocks. Thanks for being here to share these really evergreen, core ideas.
Kinnel: You're welcome.
Benz: Thanks for watching. I'm Christine Benz for Morningstar.com.

Investors often overlook beauty product companies, since they're usually lumped together with bigger and more diversified personal care companies. However, beauty product makers can offer more focused growth than those bigger companies, and their product lines are generally easier to follow.
Beauty product stocks usually don't pay out hefty dividends comparable to personal care stalwart Procter & Gamble's (NYSE:PG) 3.2% forward yield. Yet there are still a few beauty companies that pay decent yields. Let's check out three of those potential income plays -- Coty (NYSE:COTY), Inter Parfums (NASDAQ:IPAR), and Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL).

Coty
Coty sells a portfolio of more than 77 cosmetics, fragrances, and body care brands in over 130 countries. It produces licensed brands for designers and celebrities, and its top brands include Chloe, Sally Hansen, OPI, Marc Jacobs, and Calvin Klein. It expanded significantly last year when it acquired 43 of P&G's beauty brands for $12.5 billion, which added major brands like Covergirl, Max Factor, Wella, and Clairol to its portfolio.
Coty is currently the largest maker of fragrances in the world, the second largest salon hair products maker, and the third largest maker of color cosmetics. Wall Street expects the P&G acquisition to boost Coty's revenue by 74% this year, but acquisition costs could cause its earnings to fall 45%. But after clearing those expenses, analysts expect Coty's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 16% and 21% next year.
Coty pays a forward dividend yield of 2.7%. It's only raised that payout for three straight years, but it recently doubled its dividend (to $0.50 per year) and shifted from semi-annual to quarterly payments. Coty's earnings-based payout ratio temporarily exceeds 100% due to the P&G deal, but it only spent 69% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months -- so it should have plenty of room for future hikes.
Inter Parfums
Inter Parfums produces licensed fragrances for companies like Abercrombie & Fitch, Coach, Anna Sui, Dunhill, Jimmy Choo, Lanvin, and Montblanc. Its products are sold in over 100 countries worldwide. It runs its business in two divisions -- one in the United States and the other in the European Union.

Inter Parfums' business may sound like a slow growth one, but its growth has been fairly solid. Analysts expect its sales and earnings to respectively rise 9% and 10% this year, fueled by ongoing growth in its core markets (Western Europe and North America) and fresh growth from smaller markets like China and Russia, where the company has invested heavily in new market campaigns and promotions. 
Inter Parfums pays a forward dividend yield of 1.9%, which is supported by a low earnings-based payout ratio of 51%. The company spent 50% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months, and it's raised its quarterly dividend annually for four straight years.





Estee Lauder
Estee Lauder's cosmetics portfolio includes its namesake brand and well-known brands like Aveda, Donna Karan, MAC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, and Clinique. Estee Lauder also develops licensed fragrances for companies like Michael Kors and Tommy Hilfiger.
After a rare annual dip in revenue and earnings in fiscal 2015, Estee Lauder's top and bottom line growth have remained slow but steady. Analysts expect its revenue and earnings to respectively grow 5% and 6% this year, fueled by growth in China, the travel retail channel, and well-performing new brands like Too Faced and BECCA. The company expects those tailwinds to offset tough headwinds like weak foot traffic in U.S. stores; macro challenges in the Middle East, Turkey, and Latin America; and worldwide currency fluctuations.
Estee Lauder has raised its quarterly dividend annually for four straight years, and it currently pays a forward yield of 1.5%. That yield might seem low, but the company only spent 43% of its earnings and 39% of its free cash flow on dividends over the past 12 months -- so it still has room to raise its payout.
But mind the valuations...
Coty, Inter Parfums, and Estee Lauder all look like solid, slow-growth income plays, but investors should be wary of their current valuations. Coty's P/E is currently negative, due to the P&G deal, but its forward P/E merely matches the industry average of 20. Meanwhile, Inter Parfums and Estee Lauder respectively trade at 31 and 29 times earnings -- making them pricey plays for a frothy market.
Therefore, investors should probably wait for a pullback before buying any of these income generating beauty plays. For now, they should probably focus on cheaper dividend plays with less downside potential.

DGRW: WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund


Large technology companies are often today's economic leaders - creating the products and services that quickly become necessities. It might surprise you to learn that these companies have also been leading the way in dividend growth. And if your dividend fund uses a backward-looking growth screen, you probably won't be able to take advantage of these dividend growth trends for 5, 10 or even 20 years. DGRW, the WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund, is a forward-looking ETF that seeks to help you capture today's dividend growth trends.

How We Weight By Dividends


How We Weight By Dividends

While the majority of ETFs are market cap-weighted — meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals - WisdomTree has developed a proprietary index methodology designed to magnify the effect fundamentals have on risk and return characteristics.

The WisdomTree Dividend Indexes typically weight each stock eligible for inclusion by its share of the Dividend Stream®, defined as the sum of regular cash dividends paid by all the companies in the respective Index.

How We Weight By Earnings
While the majority of ETFs are market cap-weighted – meaning they give more weight to companies selling at higher prices than those offering stronger fundamentals – WisdomTree has developed a proprietary index methodology designed to magnify the effect fundamentals have on risk and return characteristics.
The WisdomTree Earnings Indexes typically weight each stock eligible for inclusion by its share of the Earnings Stream, defined as the sum of aggregate earnings generated by all companies in the respective Index.

DGRS - WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Dividend Growth








































































                        We believe small companies have big potential. Not only do they tend to outperform their larger counterparts over long periods of time, but historically they also tend lead the way out of recessions. Additionally, many small companies offer dividends that make them highly desirable to investors seeking income. Now, for the first time, WisdomTree brings you a forward-looking dividend growth exchange-traded fund (ETF) that helps enable you to capture the potential of small-cap dividend payers. DGRS, the WisdomTree U.S. SmallCap Quality Dividend Growth Fund, looks at current—and future—dividend potential to help investors gain exposure to the small companies that grow their dividends the fastest.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
