What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Investment Strategies





Navigating the sea of stock, bonds, investments, and the associated news stories that are designed to influence an investment decision can be completely overwhelming. Conflicting information as well as information overload can motivate one to move too soon in the market or not at all. We can bring a disciplined process to your investments that will free you of the emotional concerns associated with today's investment markets. Commonwealth Financial Services has a core set of investment strategies it has created to match the suitability of the investment to a client's risk tolerance score. This risk tolerance is assessed through a carefully researched questionnaire. Once the risk tolerance is determined, this is matched with a CFS strategy that aligns best to help pursue your investment goals. This is a hypothetical example and is not representative of any specific investment. Your results may vary. No one can time the market

Retirement Preparation





You have worked hard all of your life so let us work hard for you. Do you know what age you should start your Social Security benefits and why? Do you know how to evaluate any pension benefits that you have to maximize your income but still protect your family? Have you considered the impact of health care costs? What investment allocation should you maintain and what will be the impact of inflation? Have you considered the impact to your income if you live longer than expected? We answer all these questions as part of our Retirement Preparation Program. As you get closer and closer to retirement, it is important to continue to measure progress toward your goals and our ongoing process does just that. Reevaluation and monitoring can also smooth out the transition from working to retirement. The goal is financial security in retirement. Let us help you along the way.

Company structure

How many advisors do you have, and how many home office employees do you have to support them?
Commonwealth has approximately 1,710 active producing advisors and 810 full-time home office staff, which gives us an advisor-to-staff ratio of better than 2.2:1—one of the best in the business. 


Where are you located?
Commonwealth has two home office locations: Waltham, Massachusetts, and San Diego, California.


Will Commonwealth stay independent and privately owned?
Commonwealth is 100% owned and controlled by the management of the firm. The ownership and management have been stable and consistent since 1979. All 10 principals of the firm have been with Commonwealth between 18 and 37 years.
For many reasons, Commonwealth clearly looks to remain a privately held firm. First and foremost, the principals of Commonwealth are relatively young; they love what they do, whom they do it with, and have absolutely no intention of retiring from the business anytime soon. Second, as one of the few remaining truly independent firms, we have a competitive advantage in the marketplace by remaining independent. In short, we think we’d be crazy to sell a nicely growing business we love to an insurance company or a bank that would immediately alter a culture we’ve spent three decades cultivating.
We also do not foresee going public. In our estimation, companies go public for two reasons: it’s either a liquidity event for the owners, or the company needs access to the broader capital markets to fund an expansion beyond what it can internally finance. Commonwealth’s ownership has no need or desire to "cash out." We’re very satisfied running our broker/dealer–RIA and do not harbor international ambitions—and the last thing we want is the pressure of quarterly numbers driving our management decisions.
The bottom line is that building this broker/dealer–RIA has been our lifework and that retaining the autonomy to manage it while remaining true to our core principles is essential. We value our independence in much the same manner as our advisors value theirs.

Investment and product offerings

What products and services do you offer?
Commonwealth is a full-service broker/dealer–RIA with a complete range of investment and insurance products available to our advisors and their clients in a completely nonproprietary environment. These products include, but are not limited to, more than 13,000 mutual funds; individual equities; options; fixed income products; precious metals; limited partnerships and private placements; variable annuities; and variable life, term, whole life, disability, and long-term care insurance.


Can you tell me about what you offer for fee-based asset management programs?
Commonwealth’s fee-based asset management program, Preferred Portfolio Services® (PPS), provides the entire infrastructure required to operate virtually any type of fee-based asset management practice. Our programs allow our Investment Adviser Representatives to manage portfolios on a fully discretionary basis, or to delegate the security selection and rebalancing of portfolios to our sub-advisors utilizing individual equities, mutual funds, or ETFs. Among the available turnkey programs are PPS Select, Symmetry Partners, and Russell Investments, just to name a few. From compliance guidance and advisory agreements, to research and Internet-based performance reporting, our fee-based programs are cutting edge. Read more about our advisory services programs.


Can I do insurance business at Commonwealth?
Yes. Commonwealth has its own full-service general agency. Insurance is one of the fastest-growing areas of the firm. While our advisors are not required to run their fixed insurance through us, most choose to do so for a number of reasons. These include complete underwriting and sales support—including illustration preparation and ordering medical requirements—competitive pricing from more than 50 carriers, and a staff who truly see themselves as your business partners. Also, insurance commissions are added to your securities production for payout and conference qualification purposes. Find more in our Product Solutions section.


What research support do you provide?
 We offer an extensive third-party research package directly through our back-office website, COMMunity Link®. This package consists of Value Line,  Argus, Broadridge/Forefield, and Morningstar® Advisor WorkstationSM. The monthly cost for this package is $200. We also conduct extensive proprietary mutual fund research for the benefit of our advisors and will perform portfolio reviews and create custom investment proposals free of charge.
In addition, Commonwealth Research offers a discretionary managed account platform—PPS Select. The platform offers an array of distinct model portfolios that incorporate various mutual funds, ETFs, and individual bonds. Each portfolio is engineered to seek consistent, long-term risk-adjusted returns and leverages the expertise of Commonwealth's Investment Research team.


Do you offer any financial planning software?
Commonwealth offers a customized version of MoneyGuidePro™ to our advisors. MoneyGuidePro is an Internet-based financial planning program that offers goal-based planning and retirement income planning; it also includes insurance needs analysis, asset allocation, portfolio optimization, employee stock option planning, and simple estate planning.
Also available is the NaviPro Planning Suite, which  includes NaviPlan Premium and Profiles Premium. NaviPlan Premium is a web-based  multimodular financial planning software that can accommodate simple or  sophisticated plans. Profiles Premium helps  you deliver engaging, interactive presentations, uncover deeper client needs,  and close each sale faster. 
Money Tree is our third offering. Money Tree’s TOTAL Planning System packages two of Money Tree’s most popular programs, giving you the goal-based planning of Easy Money with the comprehensive cash flow planning of Golden Years. In addition, the TOTAL Planning System includes Strategic Solutions, which creates retirement planning presentations to explain complex concepts to clients.
Commonwealth Investment Adviser Representative may charge financial planning fees under Commonwealth’s corporate Registered Investment Adviser.

Operations

Who is Commonwealth’s clearing firm?
We have been clearing with National Financial Services LLC (NFS) since 1987. We were their first nonbank correspondent, and we remain one of the largest independent broker/dealer–RIAs using their clearing services. Commonwealth is a member of both the Advisory Board and the Service Steering Committee NFS has established for its top correspondent firms.
What many advisors might initially fail to appreciate is how different a clearing firm will look depending on which broker/dealer–RIA they are accessed through. For our part, we have chosen not to delegate key functions like transfer of assets and cashiering to NFS, and we’ve chosen to pay for upgraded optional services (e.g., expanded tax reporting) on behalf of our advisors. Perhaps of paramount importance, we’ve invested considerable time and money internally developing technology to customize the NFS experience for Commonwealth advisors.


What kind of transition support do you have?
Many new advisors tell us that their transition experience truly cemented their decision to join Commonwealth. An advisor may only move once or twice in his or her career, but our Transition professionals do it every day, so we know how to help you avoid the pitfalls. Our 30-member Transition team is the most proactive in the industry; we guide you every step of the way, babysit Automated Customer Account Transfers (ACATs) to ensure the fastest possible transfer of assets, and provide personal training to get new financial professionals and their staffs up to speed. Needless to say, we also have a wealth of experience contending with noncompete contracts. Learn more about how we make the transition process easy for you.


Can you tell me about your Compliance department and your approach to compliance?
Commonwealth has an outstanding Compliance team who truly see themselves as advisors’ partners and counselors. These are real people who are there to help advisors remain compliant in our highly regulated, dynamic industry. From a fundamental perspective, our decidedly selective approach to advisors enables Compliance to move past designing policies and procedures to the lowest common denominator so they can focus on appropriate guidelines for reputable, established producers. For more information, visit our Compliance section.


Can you tell me about technology at Commonwealth and what you provide?
Our solutions are designed not just for you, but from your point of view. We put ourselves in your shoes—and behind your desk—so we can develop tools to simplify your life, save you time, and help you be as productive as possible. 
Everything you need to run your business is available through your browser 24/7—from Client360°® , which lets you see and manage the complete picture for each client in once place, to Work in Progress, where you can track the status of your paperwork in real time. And, you can access the New Account Wizard, which lets you establish an account number, fund the account, and start trading immediately.
We never stop looking for ways to make your life easier—and your business more successful. Learn more about the technology Commonwealth has to offer.


Does Commonwealth provide marketing support?
Commonwealth’s Practice Management and Marketing teams work together to provide  marketing support and expertise through consultation, template collateral material, off-the-shelf marketing campaigns, and customized development, when appropriate, to help you promote and grow your business. Find out more about how we can help you with your marketing efforts.


Does Commonwealth provide practice management support?
Nearly unique in the industry, Commonwealth has a fully staffed Practice Management department dedicated to developing our advisors’ practices. From the big picture (writing a sensible business plan), to staffing, training, marketing, efficient workflows, and succession planning, we offer personal consultation focused on your individual situation and goals. 
At Commonwealth, there’s no additional charge for our Practice Management  consultation. Some firms charge an à la carte fee for using these services. Our philosophy is very different; we don’t think we have to charge you a fee to help you. We help you grow because it’s good business and it makes sense.

Costs and payouts

What are your fees?
There are only four required fees that advisors must pay to do business through Commonwealth:

Errors and Omissions (E&O) Insurance: $2,450/year
Licensing, registration, and bonding fees (which vary depending on which and how many states an advisor is licensed in): approx. $400/year
Technology Fee: $250 per month, per licensed advisor
SIPC Assessment Fee: 0.15 percent of gross broker/dealer–RIA reallowance, assessed each commission cycle (semimonthly)



What is the payout*?
When you elect to join Commonwealth, you are required to include proof of gross dealer concessions at your current firm. This production will serve to establish your starting payout at Commonwealth. The payout schedule, which is retroactive back to dollar one on a calendar-year basis, is as follows:



 
B/D Commission Volume $3,000,001+$3,000,000 $2,000,000+$1,000,000+$750,000+$500,000+$150,000+$100,000+Under $100,000
Standard Payout95%  † 92%91%90%89%88%87%85%50%



 † 95% is on the revenues above $3 million only and applies only to individuals and formal business entities.
Advisors using our fee-based platform, PPS, will receive enhanced payouts. Those who have PPS assets under management of at least $25 million will qualify for a quarterly payout based on a percentage of their PPS management fees, starting at 90 percent and rising to a maximum of 98 percent.



 
PPS Assets Under Management$500,000,000+$250,000,000+$150,000,000+$100,000,000+$50,000,000+$25,000,000+$10,000,000+
Enhanced Payout98%97%96%95%94%90%Regular Schedule A



Commonwealth has one of the most competitive payout structures in the industry. Don’t be fooled by oversimplified promises in ad copy; real commission contracts include a laundry list of fees, ticket charges, and product types. The only way to understand the bottom line for your individual practice is to perform an in-depth, customized analysis. We would be delighted to do this for you.
Please also note: You pay your broker/dealer–RIA for services. Too many advisors don’t realize that:

Most broker/dealer–RIAs do not offer similar services.
These incremental differences have a significant impact on an advisor’s bottom line.
While it is important to understand your payout, it may be even more critical to understand the services that the brokerage firm provides, as well as the impact they will have on your practice. In this day and age of books and records and shrinking margins, many broker/dealer–RIAs are pushing even more work down onto their advisors. Our goal at Commonwealth, on the other hand, is to relieve your offices of as much administrative burden as possible, so you can focus on revenue-generating activities.

*Subject to change


Do you have any quotas?
We feel that the true essence of an independent broker/dealer–RIA, and, in turn, a truly independent advisor, means that you have a wide array of product choices without the pressure of filling any type of quota. Therefore, we do not subject you to any product-related quotas. We are, however, looking for advisors with a minimum production of $200,000.


What are your transaction costs for mutual funds, equities, and the like?
The majority of mutual fund ticket charges have been eliminated for our 30+ Core mutual fund families. For the remainder, ticket charges for buys and sells placed online are discounted to $15. Exchanges are free. There is a $25 transaction charge for OTC stocks. The charge for listed securities is $25 plus $0.01 per share over 1,000 shares. The transaction charge is $19.95 (plus $0.01 per share over 1,000 for listed) if the trade is placed online. Advisors with more than $25 million in PPS assets will see a 50-percent reduction in the cost of PPS online orders for equities and exchange-traded funds, from $16 to $7.95.

Industry

What is a broker/dealer–registered investment adviser?
A broker/dealer–RIA is a company that buys and sells investment products on behalf of investors. In our case, investors don’t contact us directly; rather, we receive instructions from the 1,710 financial professionals who are affiliated with us. Commonwealth advisors are independent business owners who have relationships with their clients, and we function as the unseen back office that processes client transactions for them.
Ours is a heavily regulated business. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) delegates the supervision of financial advisors to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). FINRA, in turn, requires every financial advisor to affiliate with one, and only one, broker/dealer–RIA, so that the chain of responsibility is clear.


What does it mean to be "independent"?
Commonwealth is an “independent” broker/dealer–RIA, which means that our advisors work for themselves out of their own offices and are free to help their clients choose the best investment products—without pressure to sell a particular company’s products—to meet their financial goals. This business model differs from that of other, large financial institutions, known as "wirehouses," whose advisors (stock brokers) are employees of the company.


Why have our advisors chosen to affiliate with Commonwealth?
People who affiliate with us are independent business owners who prefer to have unlimited freedom of choice in what they can offer clients. They tend to be entrepreneurial by nature and are comfortable with the responsibilities and challenges of running their own business.
The typical Commonwealth advisor chooses us for our ability to process client transactions with exceptional accuracy and professionalism, certainly. But equally important is our unparalleled reputation for helping them build successful businesses. We support our advisors by providing them with everything from technology to free practice management consultants. And it’s this added value—together with our focus on delivering indispensable service—that makes Commonwealth invaluable to those who want to strengthen their relationships with clients and to continue growing their businesses.

For many reasons, Commonwealth clearly looks to remain a privately held firm.

Company Culture

What makes Commonwealth a great place to work?
Commonwealth completely gets that it is about employee engagement; that we work hard every day to make sure we attract competent, fun, vibrant, hard-working people. This is how we protect our valuable culture. We work to achieve the four pillars of the mission statement: profitability, indispensable service, fun, and individual development. We invest in our people through our professional development program; we create ways to make friends and have fun at work. The senior management of the firm truly believes we are only as strong as our people.


Are there job growth opportunities in the firm?
Yes, we ask that all employees remain in their department for a minimum of 12 months. We have ample job openings at any given time and if you take advantage of training programs, on-the-job learning opportunities, and develop true competency in a particular area, you should have opportunities to move. Over the last two years, nearly one-third of our employees have transitioned into a new role—either upward or laterally—within Commonwealth.


How often do advisors come to the home office?
Advisors come in to visit on a regular basis. We have lots of opportunities to meet our customers.

Back to top
Benefits

How much paid time off do I get my first year?
Personal time off (PTO) is a bank of days that includes vacation time, sick days, or any necessary time needed away from work, including all unforeseen circumstances. PTO gives employees responsibility for deciding how to use their personal time off, without having to categorize it.
Employees are allowed 16 days in their first and second years of employment. The number of days increases each year, reaching the maximum on the eighth year with 28 days. 


How does the tuition reimbursement program work?
Employees are eligible to apply for tuition assistance after completing six months of service. Courses eligible for reimbursement are those taken at an accredited school and related to the employee’s present or future work with the company. A maximum reimbursement of $5,250 is available for full-time employees in each calendar year.


When can I join the 401(k) plan and does Commonwealth match my contribution?
Commonwealth offers a 401(k) plan to allow employees to save additional money toward retirement. Employees are eligible to participate on their date of hire (assuming the minimum requirement of 1,000 hours worked per year is met). Commonwealth provides an employer match of 50 cents for every dollar the employee defers, up to the first 10 percent of his or her base salary. This means that if 10 percent of your monthly base salary equals $200, Commonwealth will contribute $100 on your behalf.

Protecting your assets

Can you tell me more about Commonwealth's relationship with NFS?
We believe that we can deliver substantial benefits from the important service relationship we maintain with NFS. Knowing that every investor's account is being serviced with the commitment and resources of an industry leader allows our advisors to focus on what they do best: provide the personalized guidance and comprehensive investment services you need to reach your goals.
NFS's reputation for delivering quality products and services is made available to you through Commonwealth and your investment professional.
Together with NFS, we offer you these benefits:

The experience of an industry leader
Complete investment reporting on one easy-to-read, consolidated statement

Thousands of well-known class shares, including Fidelity Investments



How can I be sure my assets are being protected?
You can feel confident that much of the critical trade processing, clearance, client reporting, and systems backing your investment professional is performed by NFS, an industry leader. NFS processes tens of thousands of transactions for millions of investors like you every day. NFS has both the vision and the resources to provide you with innovative products and services for many years to come.
NFS is a leading clearing firm and is subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA), and other principal exchanges of which it is a member.


Is there any insurance provided to protect me?
Commonwealth and NFS are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a federal nonprofit corporation that protects customer assets in the unlikely event that a member broker/dealer–RIA should fail to meet its financial obligations.
As a result, if your broker/dealer–RIA should fail, and NFS fails, cash awaiting reinvestment and all securities held in your account are protected by SIPC coverage up to $500,000 (limited to $250,000 for claims in cash). Coverage does not protect against a decline in the market value of securities.
