Under no circumstances will any individual employed by or affiliated with a direct or indirect competitor of CFC be considered an authorized user of the Restricted Sites. The Restricted Sites, together with the portions of CFC’s websites that are available to the general public without the need to be an authorized user, are collectively referred to as the “CFC Websites.”

CFC is under no obligation to confirm the actual identity or authority of any party accessing the Restricted Sites using your User ID and password. Users agree to keep these passwords private and further agree to refrain from sharing the passwords with any other person or allowing any other person to log onto or use the Restricted Sites. Passwords must be kept secure and should not be revealed over the phone, in an unencrypted e-mail message or in writing and should not be stored on a portable data storage device, such as a laptop, flash drive, tablet or mobile phone. You are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of your User ID and password.
Please notify the CFC Member Center (identified at the end of the Terms of Use) promptly if you become aware that any password information or any area of the CFC Websites has been compromised, or if you become aware of any unauthorized access to an account, whether or not such access was by someone who is generally authorized to access the system or is authorized to access other accounts.

Users agree to keep these passwords private and further agree to refrain from sharing the passwords with any other person or allowing any other person to log onto or use the Restricted Sites. Passwords must be kept secure and should not be revealed over the phone, in an unencrypted e-mail message or in writing and should not be stored on a portable data storage device, such as a laptop, flash drive, tablet or mobile phone.

Users agree to keep these passwords private and further agree to refrain from sharing the passwords with any other person or allowing any other person to log onto or use the Restricted Sites. Passwords must be kept secure and should not be revealed over the phone, in an unencrypted e-mail message or in writing and should not be stored on a portable data storage device, such as a laptop, flash drive, tablet or mobile phone.

YOUR USE OF THIS WEBSITE CONSTITUTES YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS OF USE.
CFC Websites Terms of Use
National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation ("CFC") provides information through public websites and enables secure online account access through CFC's private websites that require authentication. The CFC private websites that require authentication shall be known as the “Restricted Sites” and refer to those portions of our websites that are secure, non-public and accessible only after a user has registered and been authorized by CFC. A user is authorized by CFC only if the individual is (i) an employee, board member or authorized agent of a CFC member, associate or affiliate, or (ii) an individual employed by a non-member organization granted access by CFC for a particular purpose; but such authority shall be limited to only those portions of the Restricted Sites that CFC authorizes the user to access. Under no circumstances will any individual employed by or affiliated with a direct or indirect competitor of CFC be considered an authorized user of the Restricted Sites. The Restricted Sites, together with the portions of CFC’s websites that are available to the general public without the need to be an authorized user, are collectively referred to as the “CFC Websites.” 
By accessing and using the CFC Websites, you ("User(s)" and "you") agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein (“Terms of Use”) as modified from time to time by CFC. These Terms of Use constitute a legal contract between you and CFC, and by accessing or using any part of the CFC Websites you represent and warrant that you have the right, power and authority to use the CFC Websites you access and to agree to and be bound by these Terms of Use. You should carefully read and understand these Terms of Use, including the DISCLAIMERS, LIABILITY WAIVERS, LIMITATION OF DAMAGES, INDEMNITY AND OTHER IMPORTANT TERMS AT THE END OF THESE TERMS OF USE, before accessing or authorizing access to the CFC Websites.

You represent and warrant that (a) you own or have the full right, power and authority to grant to CFC use of and rights in and to all content you submit to CFC, (b) your license of such content to CFC does not, and the use of such content by CFC will not, infringe any right or interest owned or possessed by any third party and (c) there are no claims or judgments relating to such content.

Users agree to keep these passwords private and further agree to refrain from sharing the passwords with any other person or allowing any other person to log onto or use the Restricted Sites. Passwords must be kept secure and should not be revealed over the phone, in an unencrypted e-mail message or in writing and should not be stored on a portable data storage device, such as a laptop, flash drive, tablet or mobile phone. You are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of your User ID and password.
Please notify the CFC Member Center (identified at the end of the Terms of Use) promptly if you become aware that any password information or any area of the CFC Websites has been compromised, or if you become aware of any unauthorized access to an account, whether or not such access was by someone who is generally authorized to access the system or is authorized to access other accounts.

You should promptly notify us of any misuse or unauthorized access that comes to your attention. We reserve the right to investigate any misuse or unauthorized access of secure information, including User's online accounts, and to contact law enforcement as we deem necessary or appropriate. By accessing and using the CFC Websites after the effective date of these Terms of Use, you agree to cooperate with us in this regard and to abide by these Terms of Use.

The National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (CFC) is a member-owned nonprofit cooperative that provides financial products to America's rural electric cooperative network.[1] CFC was established in 1969 to raise funds from the capital markets to supplement the loan programs for electric cooperatives offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS), previously Rural Electrification Administration (REA).
While CFC is not a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), it (along with its telephone affiliate, RTFC), has forged an effective public-private partnership with RUS. This partnership enables CFC's utility borrowers to access an array of financing options including those provided by the federal government.[2]
Together, CFC and its affiliates, the National Cooperative Services Corporation (NCSC) and the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), provide financing to 1,460 member organizations and affiliates in 49 states, the District of Columbia and two territories. Rural electric systems serve 12 percent of all consumers of electricity in the United States and its territories,[1] account for approximately 10 percent of total sales of electricity [3] and own about 5 percent of electric generation capacity.[3]
At the end of FY2015 (May 31, 2015), CFC's total loans outstanding were $21.5 billion, and its owners had $4 billion invested in CFC securities. About 98 percent of CFC’s loan portfolio was with electric borrowers and 2 percent was with the telecommunications sector.[1]

CFC operates from its corporate headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, with a staff of 232 employees, including regional representatives located throughout the country.[4]
Stock Symbols[edit]
Cooperative Finance Corporation (NRUCFC) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s symbols are NRU and NRC.

This partnership enables CFC's utility borrowers to access an array of financing options including those provided by the federal government.[2]
Together, CFC and its affiliates, the National Cooperative Services Corporation (NCSC) and the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), provide financing to 1,460 member organizations and affiliates in 49 states, the District of Columbia and two territories. Rural electric systems serve 12 percent of all consumers of electricity in the United States and its territories,[1] account for approximately 10 percent of total sales of electricity [3] and own about 5 percent of electric generation capacity.[3]
At the end of FY2015 (May 31, 2015), CFC's total loans outstanding were $21.5 billion, and its owners had $4 billion invested in CFC securities. About 98 percent of CFC’s loan portfolio was with electric borrowers and 2 percent was with the telecommunications sector.[1]

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion and analysis is designed to provide a better understanding of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations and as such should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto and the information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Unless stated otherwise, references to "we," "our" or "us" relate to the consolidation of National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation ("CFC"), Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative ("RTFC"), National Cooperative Services Corporation ("NCSC") and certain entities created and controlled by CFC to hold foreclosed assets and to accommodate loan securitization transactions.  Throughout this management discussion and analysis, we will refer to certain of our financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") as "adjusted." In our Executive Summary, our discussion focuses on the key metrics that we use to evaluate our business, which are adjusted times interest earned ratio ("TIER") and adjusted debt-to-equity ratio. The most closely related GAAP measures are TIER and debt-to-equity ratio. We measure our performance based on GAAP and non-GAAP measures. The financial covenants in our revolving credit agreements and debt indentures are based on our adjusted measures rather than the related GAAP measures. The main adjustments we make to calculate the non-GAAP measures compared with the related GAAP measures are to adjust interest expense to include derivative cash settlements; to adjust net income, senior debt and total equity to exclude the non-cash adjustments from the accounting for derivative financial instruments; to exclude from senior debt the amount that funds CFC member loans guaranteed by the Rural Utilities Service ("RUS"), subordinated deferrable debt and members' subordinated certificates; and to adjust total equity to include subordinated deferrable debt and members' subordinated certificates. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further explanation of the adjustments we make to our financial results for our own analysis and covenant compliance and for a reconciliation to the related GAAP measures.  Our primary objective as a member-owned cooperative lender is to provide cost-based financial products to our rural electric and telecommunications members while maintaining sound financial results required for investment-grade credit ratings on our debt instruments. Our objective is not to maximize net income; therefore, the rates we charge our member-borrowers reflect our adjusted interest expense plus a spread to cover our operating expenses, a provision for loan losses and earnings sufficient to achieve interest coverage to meet our financial objectives. Our goal is to earn an annual minimum adjusted TIER of 1.10 and to achieve and maintain an adjusted debt-to-equity ratio within a range of 6.00-to-1.  Executive Summary  Lending Activity  During the year ended May 31, 2013, $1,746 million of CFC long-term fixed-rate loans repriced. Of this total, $1,450 million selected a new long-term fixed rate; $173 million selected a long-term variable rate; $27 million selected a new rate offered as part of our loan sales program and were sold by CFC with CFC continuing to service the loans sold; and $96 million were repaid in full.  Funding Activity  Credit spreads and rates continued to decrease during fiscal 2013, which provided us with the opportunity to refinance maturing debt with lower cost debt and exercise early redemptions of our collateral trust bonds and subordinated deferrable debt to replace such debt with lower cost debt. Specifically, we completed a debt exchange transaction in which we exchanged $340 million of our 8 percent medium-term notes, Series C, due 2032 for $379 million of 4.023 percent collateral trust bonds due 2032 and $134 million of cash. On March 1, 2013, we redeemed early $300 million of our $900 million, 5.50  percent, collateral trust bonds with an original maturity of July 1, 2013. On April 25, 2013, we issued $400 million of 4.75 percent subordinated debt due 2043. On May 24, 2013, we redeemed early all of our $88 million of Series NRC 6.10 percent subordinated debt due 2044 and all of our $98 million of Series NRU 5.95 percent subordinated debt due 2045 at par. During the year ended May 31, 2013, we continued to maintain a high utilization of our commercial paper and other short-term funding to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. At May 31, 2013 and 2012, commercial paper, select notes, daily liquidity fund and bank bid notes outstanding represented 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, of total debt outstanding.  In March 2013, we took advantage of availability in the capital markets to extend the maturity and increase the amount of our revolving credit agreements thereby providing us with an additional source of liquidity over the near term. Specifically, we amended our $1,125 million three-year, $885 million four-year, and $835 million five-year revolving credit agreements to (i) extend the maturity dates for the three-year, four-year, and five-year revolving credit agreements to October 21, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively, and (ii) lower the facility fee for the three-year revolving credit agreement to 10 basis points. With respect to the three-year agreement, $219 million of commitments will expire at the original maturity date of March 21, 2014 and the facility fee for lenders holding such commitments will continue to be 15 basis points until maturity. In addition, we exercised our option to increase the commitment levels for the four-year and five-year revolving credit agreements to $1,008 million, and $958 million, respectively. On May 30, 2013, we exercised the commitment increase option under our $1,125 million three-year credit agreement maturing on October 21, 2015 and increased the commitment by $10 million.  Financial Results  The increase to our adjusted net income for the year ended May 31, 2013 as compared with the prior year was driven primarily by an increase in the recovery of our loan losses, a reduction to the loss reported on foreclosed asset operations and an increase to fee income and adjusted net interest income. For the year ended May 31, 2013, we reported a recovery of loan losses of $70 million compared to $18 million for the prior year. The increase in the recovery is due to refinements in assumptions used to estimate of our allowance for loan losses. For the year ended May 31, 2013 we also reported a net loss of $1 million from foreclosed assets compared with a loss of $67 million in the prior year. This improvement in results was primarily due to the fact that no impairment was recorded at May 31, 2013 versus $45 million of impairment in the prior year and $13 million of positive one-time adjustments being recorded in the current year period. We had an increase of $20 million to fee and other income for the year ended May 31, 2013, which is primarily due to the $13 million prepayment fee received on a capital expenditures loan in September 2012 and other prepayment fees received. We also had an increase of $21 million to adjusted net interest income, which was primarily due to the refinancing of higher cost debt with lower cost debt and the continued high utilization of our commercial paper issuance capacity.  At May 31, 2013, our debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 26.21 -to-1 compared with 39.65-to-1 at May 31, 2012. As mentioned previously, we use adjusted non-GAAP measures in our own analysis to evaluate our performance and for covenant compliance. Our adjusted debt-to-equity ratio decreased to 5.76 -to-1 at May 31, 2013 compared with 6.01-to-1 at May 31, 2012 primarily due to the increase in adjusted equity partially offset by the increase in adjusted liabilities.  Outlook for the Next 12 Months  We have $3,669 million of long-term debt scheduled to mature over the next 12 months. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity from the combination of member loan repayments and our ability to issue debt in the capital markets, to our members and in private placements, to satisfy member loan advances and meet our need to fund long-term debt maturing over the next 12 months. At May 31, 2013, we had $909 million in cash and investments, up to $749 million available under committed loan facilities from the Federal Financing Bank, $3,097 million available under committed revolving lines of credit with a syndicate of banks and, subject to market conditions, up to $2,358 million available under a revolving note purchase agreement with the Federal Agriculture Mortgage Corporation. We also have the ability to issue collateral trust bonds and medium-term notes in the capital markets and medium-term notes to members. We believe we can continue to roll over the $4,050 million of commercial paper, select notes, daily liquidity fund and bank bid notes scheduled to mature through May 31, 2014, as we expect to continue to maximize the utilization of these short-term funding options. We expect to be in compliance with the covenants under our revolving credit agreements; therefore, we could draw on these facilities to repay dealer or member commercial paper that cannot be rolled over in the event of market disruptions. As of the date of our filing, approximately $1,052 million of the total long-term debt maturing in the next twelve months has matured or been refinanced.  We expect to be able to maintain the adjusted debt-to-equity ratio within a range of 6.00-to-1 over the next 12 months.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1, General Information and Accounting Polices, to the consolidated financial statements, are essential in understanding Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes to facilitate making these judgments.  We identified the allowance for loan losses and the determination of fair value of certain items on our balance sheet as critical accounting policies because they require significant estimations and judgments by management. These policies are summarized below and identify and describe the development of the variables most important in the estimation process. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs required for estimation. Where alternatives exist, we used the factors we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could affect net income. Separate from the possible future effect to net income from our model inputs, market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways, and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results.  Below is a description of the process used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of fair value for certain items on our balance sheet.  Allowance for Loan Losses  There are significant subjective assumptions and estimates used in calculating the amount of the loss allowance required. We review the estimates and assumptions used in the calculations of the loan loss allowance on a quarterly basis. Because of the subjective nature of these estimates, other estimates could be reasonable, and changes in the assumptions used and our estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements. The estimate of the allowance for loan losses is based on a review of the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, specific problem loans, current economic conditions, available market data and/or projection of future cash flows and other pertinent factors that in management's judgment may contribute to incurred losses. The methodology used to calculate the loan loss allowance is summarized below.  The loan loss allowance is calculated by dividing the portfolio into two categories of loans:  General Portfolio  During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013 we experienced an increase in the amount of loan advances. Specifically, total loans outstanding increased $819 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 which represents 59 percent of the total increase for fiscal 2013 with a larger than usual amount in the form of unsecured loans. The shift to unsecured from secured as well as the recording of our first distribution system loss prompted us to assess the inputs and assumptions used in our allowance for loan losses. We have also seen a shift in the mix of our loan portfolio to primarily electric system loans over recent years.  As of May 31, 2013, the Company made refinements in the assumptions used to estimate its allowance for loan losses. Specifically, we updated certain assumptions used to estimate defaults, which included transitioning from the S&P corporate bond default table to the S&P utility sector default table, refining the linkage between the Company's internal risk ratings and the S&P ratings and reassessing and reducing the loss emergence period.  In consideration of the aforementioned items, we determined that the Standard & Poor's corporate bond default table used prior to May 31, 2013 was no longer the most representative of the estimated default profile of our current loan portfolio. As  of May 31, 2013, we began using the Standard & Poor's utility sector default table, which we believe is more representative of the default risk associated with the current composition of our loan portfolio.  Our internal risk ratings system is designed to produce a borrower risk rating ("BRR") for each borrower and a facility risk rating ("FRR") for each loan or other credit facility. Based on our internal policies and practices, the BRR is considered a measure of a borrower's risk of default and is determined by various risk factors including quantitative and qualitative measures and assessments. The FRR is also considered a measure of default risk based on the BRR with adjustments dependent on whether the loan or other credit facility is secured or guaranteed. We have determined that the BRR, rather than the FRR, is a more accurate credit quality indicator as of May 31, 2013, and as such the risk ratings used in our loan loss model are based on BRR.  The Company has a history of limited defaults and charge-offs on our loans. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate the loans that will default during the loss emergence period, which is the time between the loss causing event(s) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of the loan. At May 31, 2013, our most recent historical experience indicates that, on average, the loss emergence period of our loan portfolio is five years, which is shorter than the time period previously estimated by the Company. Such loss emergence period considers the various workout efforts and restructurings by the Company as well as our recent experience in the current environment.  These refinements resulted in a decrease to the general allowance for loan losses of $55 million at May 31, 2013.  As a result of the refinements made in the assumptions used to estimate the general allowance for loan losses, we also refined our approach for calculating the qualitative component of the general reserve by focusing on risk factors not captured in the general allowance for loan losses. The overriding factor that creates the necessity for this additional component of loan loss reserves not captured in our loan loss model is lag in the timing of receipt of information regarding our borrowers. To measure these additional risk factors, we incorporated an internal credit risk ratings portfolio stress test into our assessment of the qualitative reserve for the general portfolio. The refinements in the qualitative component of the general reserve resulted in a decrease to the allowance for loan losses of $19 million at May 31, 2013.  We believe these refinements will more appropriately reflect the allowance for loan losses and the related provision for loan losses in our financial statements. We concluded that these refinements represent a change in an accounting estimate which we therefore recorded in the quarter ended May 31, 2013.  The combination of these refinements resulted in a decrease to the allowance for loan losses of $74 million at May 31, 2013 and a corresponding increase to the recovery of loan losses of $74 million for the quarter ended May 31, 2013.  We use the following factors to determine the loan loss allowance for the general portfolio category:  - general financial condition of the borrower;  - our judgment of the quality of the borrower's management;  - our judgment of the borrower's competitive position within its service territory and industry;  - our estimate of the potential impact of proposed regulation and litigation; and  - other factors specific to individual borrowers or classes of borrowers.  · Standard & Poor's historical utility sector default table. The table provides expected default rates for the utility sector based on rating level and the remaining maturity. We correlate our internal risk ratings to the ratings used in the utility sector default table. We use the default table to assist in estimating our loan loss allowance because we have limited history from which to develop loss expectations.  · Loss Emergence Period. Estimated based on the time between the loss causing event(s) and the date that we charge off the unrecoverable portion of the loan.  · Recovery rates. Estimated recovery rates are based on our historical recovery experience by member class calculated by comparing loan balances at the time of default to the total loss recorded on the loan. We have been lending to electric cooperatives since our incorporation in 1969.  At May 31, 2013, the $41 million reserve produced by our general allowance for loan losses model represented 0.20 percent of the outstanding balance of loans. An increase or decrease of ten percent in our default rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of $4 million to the general allowance for loan losses model. An increase or decrease of 1 percent in our recovery rates would result in a corresponding increase or decrease of $3 million to the general allowance for loan losses model.  In addition to the loan loss allowance for the general portfolio, we maintain a qualitative reserve for the general portfolio based on risk factors not captured in the general allowance for loan losses. The overriding factor that creates the necessity for this additional component of loan loss reserves not captured in our loan loss model is lag in the timing of receipt of  information regarding our borrowers. We actively monitor the operations and financial performance of our borrowers through the review of audited financial statements, review of borrower prepared financial statements (if required) and discussions with borrower management. As a result of the lag, there could be credit events or circumstances that exist with our borrowers for which we have not been made aware that could potentially lead to reassessing/downgrading of certain BRRs to better reflect the risk of default and ultimate loss. Additional qualitative considerations include our expectations with respect to loan workouts, risks associated with large loan exposures and economic and environmental factors.  To measure these additional risk factors supporting an additional reserve for the general portfolio, we perform an internal credit risk ratings portfolio stress test quantifying the impact that both upgrades and downgrades in internal credit risk ratings would have on our estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio.  Impaired Loans  · the borrower's payment history,  · communication with the borrower,  · economic conditions in the borrower's service territory,  · pending legal action involving the borrower,  · restructure agreements between us and the borrower and  · estimates of the value of the borrower's assets that have been pledged as collateral to secure our loans.  An impairment loss on a loan receivable is recognized as the difference between the recorded investment in the loan and the present value of the estimated future cash flows associated with the loan discounted at the effective interest rate. If the current balance in the receivable is greater than the net present value, the impairment is equal to that difference and a portion of the loan loss allowance is specifically reserved based on the calculated impairment. If future cash flows cannot be estimated, the loan is collateral dependent or foreclosure is probable, the impairment is calculated based on the estimated fair value of the collateral securing the loan.  In calculating the impairment on a loan, the estimates of the expected future cash flows or collateral value are the key estimates made by management. Changes in the estimated future cash flows or collateral value affect the amount of the calculated impairment. The change in cash flows required to make the change in the calculated impairment material will be different for each borrower and depend on the period covered, the effective interest rate at the time the loan became impaired and the amount of the loan outstanding. Estimates are not used to determine our investment in the receivables or the discount rate since, in all cases, the investment is equal to the loan balance outstanding at the reporting date, and the discount rate is equal to the effective interest rate on the loan at the time the loan became impaired.  Our policy for recognizing interest income on impaired loans is determined on a case-by-case basis. An impaired loan to a borrower that is non-performing will typically be placed on non-accrual status and we will reverse all accrued and unpaid interest. We generally apply all cash received during the non-accrual period to the reduction of principal, thereby foregoing interest income recognition. Interest income may be recognized on an accrual basis for restructured impaired loans where the borrower is performing and is expected to continue to perform based on agreed-upon terms.  All loans are written off in the period that it becomes evident that collectability is highly unlikely; however, our efforts to recover all charged-off amounts may continue. The determination to write off all or a portion of a loan balance is made based on various factors on a case-by-case basis including, but not limited to, cash flow analysis and the fair value of collateral securing the borrower's loans.  Fair Value  The primary instruments recorded on our balance sheet at fair value are derivative financial instruments. Derivative instruments must be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Since these instruments generally do not qualify for hedge accounting, the accounting standards require that we record all changes in fair value through earnings. We record the change in the fair value of derivative instruments, along with . . .  Aug 28, 2013  (c) 1995-2013 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

CFC is under no obligation to confirm the actual identity or authority of any party accessing the Restricted Sites using your User ID and password. Users agree to keep these passwords private and further agree to refrain from sharing the passwords with any other person or allowing any other person to log onto or use the Restricted Sites. Passwords must be kept secure and should not be revealed over the phone, in an unencrypted e-mail message or in writing and should not be stored on a portable data storage device, such as a laptop, flash drive, tablet or mobile phone. You are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of your User ID and password.
Please notify the CFC Member Center (identified at the end of the Terms of Use) promptly if you become aware that any password information or any area of the CFC Websites has been compromised, or if you become aware of any unauthorized access to an account, whether or not such access was by someone who is generally authorized to access the system or is authorized to access other accounts.

You should promptly notify us of any misuse or unauthorized access that comes to your attention. We reserve the right to investigate any misuse or unauthorized access of secure information, including User's online accounts, and to contact law enforcement as we deem necessary or appropriate.

The National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (CFC) is a member-owned nonprofit cooperative that provides financial products to America's rural electric cooperative network.[1] CFC was established in 1969 to raise funds from the capital markets to supplement the loan programs for electric cooperatives offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS), previously Rural Electrification Administration (REA).
While CFC is not a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), it (along with its telephone affiliate, RTFC), has forged an effective public-private partnership with RUS. This partnership enables CFC's utility borrowers to access an array of financing options including those provided by the federal government.[2]
Together, CFC and its affiliates, the National Cooperative Services Corporation (NCSC) and the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), provide financing to 1,460 member organizations and affiliates in 49 states, the District of Columbia and two territories. Rural electric systems serve 12 percent of all consumers of electricity in the United States and its territories,[1] account for approximately 10 percent of total sales of electricity [3] and own about 5 percent of electric generation capacity.[3]
At the end of FY2015 (May 31, 2015), CFC's total loans outstanding were $21.5 billion, and its owners had $4 billion invested in CFC securities. About 98 percent of CFC’s loan portfolio was with electric borrowers and 2 percent was with the telecommunications sector.[1]

Organizational structure[edit]
Overall policy for CFC is set by a 23-member Board of Directors, representing 10 geographic districts and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), the network's national trade association, and one At-Large member who serves as the Audit Committee Financial Expert.[4] CFC's Board is democratically elected and consists of both cooperative utility directors and managers. CFC operates from its corporate headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, with a staff of 232 employees, including regional representatives located throughout the country.[4]
Stock Symbols[edit]
Cooperative Finance Corporation (NRUCFC) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s symbols are NRU and NRC.
Affiliate Organizations[edit]
CFC manages and funds the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC),[5] an organization that provides financing to the rural telecommunications industry. CFC also manages and funds the National Cooperative Services Corporation (NCSC),[6] an organization that provides electric cooperatives with specialized financing services that supplement the financial services of CFC.

The National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation (CFC) is a member-owned nonprofit cooperative that provides financial products to America's rural electric cooperative network.[1] CFC was established in 1969 to raise funds from the capital markets to supplement the loan programs for electric cooperatives offered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Utilities Service (RUS), previously Rural Electrification Administration (REA).
While CFC is not a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE), it (along with its telephone affiliate, RTFC), has forged an effective public-private partnership with RUS. This partnership enables CFC's utility borrowers to access an array of financing options including those provided by the federal government.[2]
Together, CFC and its affiliates, the National Cooperative Services Corporation (NCSC) and the Rural Telephone Finance Cooperative (RTFC), provide financing to 1,460 member organizations and affiliates in 49 states, the District of Columbia and two territories. Rural electric systems serve 12 percent of all consumers of electricity in the United States and its territories,[1] account for approximately 10 percent of total sales of electricity [3] and own about 5 percent of electric generation capacity.[3]
At the end of FY2015 (May 31, 2015), CFC's total loans outstanding were $21.5 billion, and its owners had $4 billion invested in CFC securities. About 98 percent of CFC’s loan portfolio was with electric borrowers and 2 percent was with the telecommunications sector.[1]

CFC operates from its corporate headquarters in Dulles, Virginia, with a staff of 232 employees, including regional representatives located throughout the country.[4]

Cooperative Finance Corporation (NRUCFC) is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s symbols are NRU and NRC.
