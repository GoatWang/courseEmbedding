Pine River Capital Management L.P. is an asset management firm.[3][4][5][6] The firm trades stocks, fixed income, derivatives, warrants and listed investment vehicles.[7] The company manages approximately $14 billion[2] across three actively managed platforms: hedge funds, managed accounts and listed investment vehicles to support a number of strategies including interest rates, mortgages, equity long/short, event-driven equity, and global convertible bond arbitrage.[8][9] The company is currently managed by founder and CEO Brian Taylor and 17 partners.[10][11]

History[edit]
Brian Taylor founded Pine River in 2002 to pursue opportunities in global relative value trading with an initial investment of $5.3 million.[3][12] Since then, the company has grown to over $14 billion in assets under management and employs over 500 people.[2][13] The firm was initially located in Pine River, Minnesota, before moving to Minneapolis, Minnesota in 2003.[3] In 2007, Pine River relocated to Minnetonka.[14] Pine River now has offices in New York City, London, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, San Francisco, Austin and Luxembourg.[15][16] The firm has a presence in Shenzhen, building and maintaining analytics platforms and doing in-depth research on China’s on-shore companies and markets.[11]
Pine River Capital Management is a signatory of the Hedge Fund Standards Board.[17] Pine River Capital Management L.P. became registered as an investment advisor with the US Securities and Futures Commission in January 2006. Pine River Capital Management (UK) Limited became authorized by the British Financial Services Authority to manage investments in the UK in January 2004.

Pine River Capital Management L.P. became registered as a Foreign Institutional Investor in IIndia in February 2008.[18] Pine River also complies with the Open Protocol Enabling Risk Aggregation Standards.[19]
In 2009, a subsidiary of Pine River became the external investment manager of Two Harbors Investment Corp. (NYSE: TWO), a publicly listed real estate investment trust that invests in mortgage-backed securities and related instruments.[20]
Investment Style[edit]
Pine River’s various portfolio management teams take a relative value approach to investing, seeking to identify dislocations between prices of related financial instruments and markets.[3][21] The firm had returns of roughly 90% in 2009, largely due to its mortgage investments following the 2008 financial crisis.[3] Pine River also pursues opportunities in a range of global markets and has developed into a diversified investment firm.[22][23] Alongside its growth in assets under management, Pine River has created infrastructure and risk controls that support further expansion.[24]

Master Fund Ltd

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The Pine River Convertibles Fund engages in North American convertible and capital structure arbitrage. The portfolio manager has extensive experience in convertible arbitrage trading and model design. The Fund seeks to profit from the arbitrage relationship among corporate credit, equity volatility and equity. The Fund employs a sum-of-the-parts approach to valuation and a scenario-based approach to risk management, with particular focus on liquidity and financing risks. We anticipate limiting the capitalization so the fund remains nimble and liquid. This fund was formally known as the Nisswa Convertibles Fund.
