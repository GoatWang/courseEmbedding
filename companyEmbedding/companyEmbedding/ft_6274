It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!

Borealis HimodT FT6274 LDPE for Film 
Technical DataSheet | Supplied by

Borealis









Himod FT6274 is a tubular, low-density polyethylene grade for the production of packaging films. Compared to standard LDPE grades, the Himod products provide a combination of higher stiffness and improved optical properties. Benefits can be obtained in terms of better down gauging possibilities and improved processability. Excellent printing quality is obtained due to high clarity and better layout.Himod FT6274 is intended for applications like: fine shrink films with higher stiffness and transparency, stiff films with excellent optical properties for automated packaging machinery, and lamination film/food packaging.Information provided by the Manufacturer.
