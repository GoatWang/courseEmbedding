July 1, 2011 By Nevada Business Magazine Leave a Comment Attorney & Shareholder
Las Vegas
Number of Employees: 50
Years in Nevada: 11
Years with Company: 9
What inspired you to get into your industry?
I come from a family of business owners and executives.  I enjoy working with business professionals to help them achieve their goals, grow their businesses and, when necessary, handle their litigation needs.
How do you encourage growth and development within your company?
As attorneys, we must never forget that customer service is a critical component of our profession.  We must be incredibly responsive, provide the highest quality product and do so in a cost-effective manner.  When we do this effectively, we grow through positive referrals and repeat business.
What is the biggest challenge your industry is facing?
In litigation, incivility is becoming more of a problem.  Even when you disagree with an opponent, there is no reason to be disagreeable.  Acting civilly makes our lives more enjoyable and ultimately saves our clients time and money.
If you could have had another career, what would it have been?
I would have enjoyed playing professional soccer.  Unfortunately, I was not blessed with speed.  However, I still enjoy my favorite sport by serving as a soccer referee for high school and competitive youth games.
What is the best advice you’ve ever received?
My father once told me not to make important decisions when angry.  I often provide this same advice to clients and colleagues.  Draft a letter or email, let it sit overnight, and revise it the next morning before sending it.
What do you anticipate for the future of business in Nevada?
Nevada still epitomizes the pioneer spirit.  Our economy in general and the gaming and tourism industries will rebound, but I expect Nevada to become a more important commercial transportation, distribution and customer service hub for the Southwest.
What values do you hope to pass on to your employees?
Our partners have built a law firm where people respect and appreciate one another.  We have an open door policy which fosters mentoring and collaboration.  Working together and sharing ideas and solutions is not only enjoyable, but effective.

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
