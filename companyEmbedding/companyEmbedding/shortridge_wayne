										ADM SERIES MULTIMETERS












						The ADM series AirData Multimeters are used as hand-held 
						portable meters for air velocity, pressure, and 
						temperature measurement.


						These meters may also be used to obtain direct air flow 
						readings with an 
						



						8400 FlowHood Kit. 
						Any model meter can be upgraded to a model with greater 
						capabilities whenever needed.

						Please note that any of the ADM series AirData 
						Multimeter Kits may be purchased with or without an

8400 FlowHood Kit.

										FLOWHOODS





















								The FlowHood is a much more convenient alternative to time-consuming
                multiple velocity readings across air diffusers, as this instrument eliminates
                the need for the calculations necessary to convert the average velocity into
                air flow.
								

The AirData Multimeter utilizes the Series
                8400 FlowHood Kit for backpressure compensated measurement of air flow.



The FlowHood unit
                captures and directs the air flow from an outlet, or inlet, across the highly sensitive
                flow sensing manifold within the FlowHood base.




										    
										









The manifold simultaneously senses the
                total pressure, and the static pressure, at sixteen precision orifices spaced at the
                correct representative measurement points for the known cross-sectional area of the
                FlowHood base. 

The sensed total pressure and static pressure are combined to a single
                differential pressure, which is transmitted to the meter for conversion to direct air flow
                readout.








 
 
 





Model CFM-850L



								Model CFM-88L






The FlowHood Model 
										CFM-850L

has added functions for pitot tube air velocity, differential pressure and temperature
        measurement.




The
FlowHood
        CFM-88L 
is used for air flow measurement only, and comes complete with a CFM-88L meter
        and an air capture hood kit.
