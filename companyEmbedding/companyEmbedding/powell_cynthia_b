Preliminary results from field testing an improved refractory material for slagging coal gasifiers



Bennett, James P.
						; Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Powell, Cynthia A.
January 2004


Slag attack of refractory materials used to line the hot face of slagging gasifiers limits their service life to between 3 and 24 months. These gasifiers use coal, petroleum coke, or combinations of them as raw materials to produce chemicals, liquid fuel, and/or electricity; with future consideration being given to the use of other abundant, low cost feedstock such as biomass. The ash from these materials generate liquid slags during gasification at temperature between 1300 - 1575 C and pressures up to 1000 psi, leading to severe slag attack of a vessel lining and causing unacceptable gasifier reliability and on-linemore » availability. To maximize refractory life and provide protection of the gasifier metal shell, the best liners have contained a minimum of 60-70 pct chromia in combination with alumina, alumina/zirconia, or magnesia. The Albany Research Center of DOE has developed a phosphate containing high chrome oxide refractory liner that indicates potential for increased service life over currently used materials. This new liner has been produced commercially by a refractory company and installed in a gasifier for performance evaluation. Refractory issues in slagging gasifiers, the development and properties of the phosphate containing high chrome oxide material, and the preliminary results from the plant trial of this material will be presented.« less

An analysis of the causes of failure in high chrome oxide refractory materials from slagging gasifiers



Bennett, James P.
						; Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Powell, Cynthia A.
						; ... January 2006


High Cr2O3 refractory materials are used to line the hot face of slagging gasifiers. Gasifiers are reaction chambers that convert water, oxygen, and a carbon feedstock into CO, H2, and methane at temperatures as high as 1575DGC and pressures up to 1000 psi. Ash in the carbon feedstock liquefies, erodes and corrodes the gasifier's refractory liner, contributing to liner failure within a few months to two years. The failure of a refractory liner decreases a gasifier's on-line availability and causes costly system downtime and repairs. Many factors contribute to refractory lining failure, including slag penetration and corrosion, thermal cycling, gasifiermore » environment, and mechanical loads. The results of refractory post-mortem failure analysis and how observations relate to gasifier service life will be discussed.« less

Improved Refractory Materials for Slagging Gasifiers in IGCC Power Systems



Bennett, James P.
						; Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Powell, Cynthia A.
						; ... January 2005


Gasifiers are the heart of Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power system currently being developed as part of the DOE's Vision 21 Fossil Fuel Power Plant. A gasification chamber is a high pressure/high temperature reaction vessel used to contain a mixture of O2, H2O, and coal (or other carbon containing materials) while it is converted into thermal energy and chemicals (H2, CO, and CH4). IGCC systems are expected to play a dominant role in meeting the Nation's future energy needs. Gasifiers are also used to produce chemicals that serve as feedstock for other industrial processes, and are considered a potentialmore » source of H2 in applications such as fuel cells. A distinct advantage of gasifiers is their ability to meet or exceed current and anticipated future environmental emission regulations. Also, because gasification systems are part of a closed circuit, gasifiers are considered process ready to capture CO2 emissions for reuse or processing should that become necessary or economically feasible in the future. The service life of refractory liners for gasifiers has been identified by users as a critical barrier to IGC« less

Engineered refractories for slagging gasifiers



Powell, Cynthia A.
						; Kwong, Kyei-sing
						; Bennett, James P.
						; ... January 2005


The widespread commercial adaptation of slagging gasifier technology to produce power, liquid fuels, and/or chemicals from coal and other fossil-based feedstocks and from biomass, will depend in large measure on the technology's ability to prove itself both economic and reliable. Improvements in gasifier reliability, availability, and maintainability will in part depend on the development of improved structural materials with longer service life in this application. Current generation refractory materials used to line the gasifier vessel, and contain the gasification reaction, may last no more than three months in commercial applications. The downtime required for tear-out and replacement of these criticalmore » materials results in gasifier on-line availabilities that fall short of targeted goals. In this talk we will discuss the development of improved refractory materials engineered specifically for longer service life in this application, and present results from recent field trials in commercial systems.« less

Improving thermocouple service life in slagging gasifiers



Bennett, James P.
						; Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Powell, Cynthia A.
						; ... January 2005


The measurement of temperature within slagging gasifiers for long periods of time is difficult/impossible because of sensor failure or blockage of inputs used to monitor gasifier temperature. One of the most common means of temperature measurement in a gasifier is physically, through the use of thermocouples in a gasifier sidewall. These units can fail during startup, standby, or during the first 40-90 days of gasifier service. Failure can be caused by a number of issues; including thermocouple design, construction, placement in the gasifier, gasifier operation, and molten slag attack of the materials used in a thermocouple assembly. Lack of temperaturemore » control in a gasifier can lead to improper preheating, slag buildup on gasifier sidewalls, slag attack of gasifier refractories used to line a gasifier, or changes in desired gas output from a gasifier. A general outline of thermocouple failure issues and attempts by the Albany Research Center to improve the service life of thermocouples will be discussed.« less

Development of improved performance refractory liner materials for slagging gasifiers



Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Bennett, James P.
						; Powell, Cynthia
						; ... January 2005


Refractory liners for slagging gasifiers used in power generation, chemical production, or as a possible future source of hydrogen for a hydrogen based economy, suffer from a short service life. These liner materials are made of high Cr2O3 and lower levels of Al2O3 and/or ZrO2. As a working face lining in the gasifier, refractories are exposed to molten slags at elevated temperature that originate from ash in the carbon feedstock, including coal and/or petroleum coke. The molten slag causes refractory failure by corrosion dissolution and by spalling. The Albany Research Center is working to improve the performance of Cr2O3 refractoriesmore » and to develop refractories without Cr2O3 or with Cr2O3 content under 30 wt pct. Research on high Cr2O3 materials has resulted in an improved refractory with phosphate additions that is undergoing field testing. Results to date of field trials, along with research direction on refractories with no or low Cr2O3, will be discussed.« less

An update on the development of an improved performance refractory material for slagging coal gasifiers



Powell, Cynthia A.
						; Kwong, Kyei-Sing
						; Bennett, James P.
						; ... January 2004


Severe slag attack of high temperature materials that line coal gasifiers used in the production of chemicals, liquid fuels, and/or electricity result in their unacceptably short lifetimes, lasting anywhere from 3 months to 24 months. Lengthening of this short service life to increase gasifier reliability and increase on-line availability of a gasifier is viewed as critical for greater technology acceptance and utilization. A phosphate containing high chrome oxide refractory has been developed by the Albany Research Center of DOE and scaled up by an industrial producer of refractories for plant trials. An update of this material and its properties willmore » be presented.« less

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher Comments The family, Cynthia Patterson demonstrates, played a key role in the political changes that mark the history of ancient Greece. From the archaic society portrayed in Homer and Hesiod to the Hellenistic age, the private world of the family and household was integral with and essential to the civic realm.   Early Greek society was rooted not in clans but in individual households, and a man's or woman's place in the larger community was determined by relationships within those households. The development of the city-state did not result in loss of the family's power and authority, Patterson argues; rather, the protection of household relationships was an important element of early public law. The interaction of civic and family concerns in classical Athens is neatly articulated by the examples of marriage and adultery laws. In law courts and in theater performances, violation of marital relationships was presented as a public danger, the adulterer as a sexual thief. This is an understanding that fits the Athenian concept of the city as the highest form of family. The suppression of the cities with the ascendancy of Alexander's empire led to a new resolution of the relationship between public and private authority: the concept of a community of households, which is clearly exemplified in Menander's plays. Undercutting common interpretations of Greek experience as evolving from clan to patriarchal state, Patterson's insightful analysis sheds new light on the role of men and women in Greek culture. ReviewPatterson is to be commended for demonstrating so clearly that some of the premises which stand at the basis of research into the Greek family are not tenable in the face of the available evidence...Patterson's study is eminently useful and has the potential of becoming a fundamental work in the field of the Greek family and society. It presents a forceful argument to rethink the basic premises of how the transformation of Greek society from the archaic through to the Hellenistic period defined the family. By attacking historical myths such as that of the genos as the quintessential family or the emergence of the state at the expense of the public role of the family and of women Patterson makes clear that ideas about the family in Greek history have been seriously misconstrued. The result is an excellent and challenging piece of scholarship. Tim Parkin - Bryn Mawr Classical ReviewReviewPatterson is to be commended for demonstrating so clearly that some of the premises which stand at the basis of research into the Greek family are not tenable in the face of the available evidence...Patterson'sstudy is eminently useful and has the potential of becoming a fundamental work in the field of the Greek family and society. It presents a forceful argument to rethink the basic premises of how the transformation of Greek society fromthe archaic through to the Hellenistic period defined the family. By attacking historical myths such as that of the genosas the quintessential family or the emergence of the state at the expense ofthe public role of the family and of women Patterson makes clear that ideas about the family in Greek history have been seriously misconstrued. The result is an excellent and challenging piece of scholarship.ReviewEveryone who is interested in ancient Greek society will want to think seriously about [Patterson's] conclusions...The ancient Greek family is more complex and flexible than has usually been supposed, and relationships by marriage and adoption could be as valid in determining inheritance as blood relationships...Contrary to previous assumptions, there does not appear to have been a moment in Greek history when membership in a larger kinship group, such as a clan, took precedence over the smaller unit of the family...As Patterson shows, the spheres of public and private always overlapped, and their separation from one another has been much exaggerated, especially by historians who seek to portray the ancient Greeks as keeping women in an oriental seclusion or for treating them as socially and morally inferior beings. The complex data in Patterson's book shows that it is grossly unfair to portray the ancient Greeks as misogynists. Greek literature and drama accurately reflect women's importance, both in the family and in the larger society. Mary LefkowitzReviewPatterson...offers an attack on the continuing influence of century-old paradigms concerning the ancient Greek family. She argues convincingly that the oikos (household) and the state were closely interrelated, the state did not supersede or suppress the oikos, and there was no clear public/private split, because one's civic identity derived largely from one's oikos...[She] also explores the family in Hesiod, Homer, and early Greek law; marriage and adultery in Athens; and the family in Menander's plays. Washington TimesReview[The Family in Greek History] is a welcome and useful addition to the very recent body of scholarship that has appeared on the ancient Greek family and, although the title might not at first explicitly indicate it, to the much more considerable scholarship on the role of women in the Greek world. It is a book with both a broad ambitious and a definite thesis...It is an important contribution to several on-going revisionist debates in the field of Greek social history...Certainly all scholars with a particular interest in ancient gender studies and the history of the ancient family should read this book.
