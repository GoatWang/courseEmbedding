            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]

History[edit]




Tesoro's corporate HQ, completed in 2009, at San Antonio, TX.


Tesoro was founded in 1968[6] by Dr. Robert V. West Jr,[7] and is primarily engaged in petroleum exploration and production. Tesoro is the word for treasure (or treasury) in Italian and Spanish. In 1969, Tesoro began operating its first refinery, near Kenai, Alaska: Tesoro Corp. became the first Fortune 500 company to be headquartered in San Antonio.
In the late 1990s, Tesoro grew through a series of acquisitions and initiatives that created Tesoro Corporation, the company focusing on a single core business: petroleum refining and marketing. Acquisitions expanded refining capacity from 72,000 barrels per day (11,400 m3/d) to approximately 664,000 barrels per day (105,600 m3/d).
Milestones in the company's history are:

1998: acquires second refinery (after Nikiski) in Kapolei, Hawaii along with petroleum terminals and approximately 30 retail stations in Hawaii from BHP Americas - also acquires the former Shell refinery at Anacortes, Washington;
1999: sold exploration and production operations;
2001: purchased refineries in Mandan, North Dakota, and Salt Lake City, Utah from Amoco;
2002: acquired Golden Eagle Refinery in Martinez, California from Ultramar (Valero);
2003: sold Tesoro Marine Services to Martin Midstream LLC: Tesoro Marine Services were operating fueling and supply terminals servicing US Gulf Coast oil and gas exploration - also made a series of refinery acquisitions that boosted the company’s capacity output and positioned it for future expansion in key growth markets throughout the Western United States;
2005: largest capital expansion program in the corporation’s history and record earnings;
2007: announcement of purchase of Shell's refinery at Los Angeles refinery and approximately 250 Southern California retail stations;
2007: Tesoro acquires USA Gasoline;
2009: Tesoro employees move into a newly completed corporate campus in July.[8]
2011: Tesoro forms Tesoro Logistics LP (TLLP) as a master limited partnership;[9]
2011: Tesoro acquires 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California;
2012: Tesoro changes the 250 ARCO (Thrifty Style Stations) and Thrifty Stations in Southern California to USA Gasoline;
2013: Tesoro purchases the Carson Refinery and the ARCO brand from BP;
2013: Tesoro sells its Kapolei refinery to Par Petroleum (now Par Pacific Holdings).[10][11]
2016 Tesoro purchased Dakota Prairie Refining in Dickinson, North Dakota from WBI Energy. Construction of the refinery was completed in the spring of 2015.[citation needed]
2016: Tesoro Corp has agreed to buy Western Refining for $4.1 billion.[12]
2016/17 Par Pacific Inc. rebrands its Tesoro and 76 gas stations as Hele. [13]
2017: Tesoro announces that it will be changing its name to Andeavor following its acquisition of Western Refining. [14]

Greg J. Goff – President and CEO
Keith Casey – Executive Vice President, Operations
Kim K. Rucker – Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary
Steven Sterin - Executive Vice President, CFO

Media controversy[edit]
Environmental record[edit]




Tesoro's Anacortes Refinery at the north end of March Point, southeast of Anacortes, Washington


Having taken over BP installations, researchers at the Political Economy Research Institute identified Tesoro as being the 24th-largest corporate producer of air pollution in the United States, releasing roughly 3,740,000 lb (1,700 t) of toxic chemicals annually.[16] Major pollutants emitted annually by the corporation include more than 400,000 lb (180 t) of sulfuric acid.[17] following which the Environmental Protection Agency named Tesoro a potentially responsible party for at least four superfund toxic waste sites.[18] Tesoro has settled and/or closed each of the superfund sites for which it has been named as one of many responsible parties. Tesoro was listed as a de minimis contributor to a superfund site in Abbeville, LA, and the site has since been closed by the EPA.
Tesoro has given over $1 million in support of California Proposition 23, which aims to suspend the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006.[19]
Defenders of the Amazon forest in South America cite Tesoro for sourcing some of their crude oil from the Amazon. Three of Tesoro's refineries- Anacortes (WA), LA (CA) and Golden Eagle (CA), are known to process Amazonian crude oil.[20]
Explosion[edit]
Main article: 2010 Tesoro Anacortes Refinery disaster
On April 2, 2010, there was an explosion at the Anacortes refinery with seven deaths.[21]
Libya[edit]
After the overthrow of Colonel Gaddafi, Tesoro bought Libyan crude oil in early April 2011 from the Vitol Group to supply its then-Hawaiian refinery.[22]
