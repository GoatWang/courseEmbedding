        Gilead Sciences, Inc. Boosts Its Full-Year Outlook Thanks to Stronger-Than-Expected Hep C Sales
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Keith Speights)

            Jul 26, 2017
        Updated Jul 26, 2017





































































































When Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) reported its first-quarter results earlier this year, everyone expected sales for the biotech's hepatitis C franchise to be way down. Those expectations were met in spades. The primary good news was that Gilead's HIV drug sales were up, although not nearly enough to offset the hep C decline.Gilead provided an update on its second-quarter performance after the market closed on Wednesday. Again, expectations were for lower hep C sales. There were some hopes, though, that the rate of decline would at least slow, and that Gilead's HIV drugs would pick up momentum. Here are the highlights of what actually happened during the second quarter.Image source: Getty Images.
Gilead Sciences results: The raw numbersMetric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year ChangeSales $7.14 billion$7.78 billion (8.2%)Net income from continuing operations $3.07 billion$3.5 billion (12.1%)Adjusted EPS $2.56$3.08 (16.9%)Data source: Gilead Sciences. What happened with Gilead Sciences this quarter?As expected, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise again dragged down the company's overall financial results in the second quarter. Hep C revenue fell 27.5% year over year to $2.9 billion -- but the rate of decline slowed from the first quarter. Strong growth for Epclusa partially offset the continued plunge in sales for Harvoni and Sovaldi.What investors should have expected in the biotech's second-quarter results were improving sales for Gilead's newer HIV drugs. That turned out to be a reasonable expectation, with climbing sales for Genvoya, Descovey, and Odefsey more than making up for lower sales of older HIV drugs Truvada, Atripla, and Stribild. Overall, Gilead's HIV franchise generated revenue of $3.6 billion in the second quarter, a 16.1% jump over the prior-year period.Gilead also enjoyed solid growth outside of its antiviral product lineup. Revenue from the company's other products beyond hep C and HIV totaled $607 million in the second quarter, a 15.6% year-over-year increase.Another thing investors probably anticipated was a nice boost to Gilead's cash stockpile. The big biotech didn't disappoint, reporting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of nearly $36.6 billion, up from $34 billion at the end of the first quarter.Gilead's major developments during the second quarter included a couple of significant pipeline milestones. On July 18, the Food and Drug Administration approved hepatitis C combo Vosevi. The European Committee for the Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) also gave a positive opinion for the drug. In addition, Gilead submitted its promising bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combo for treating HIV for U.S. regulatory approval. 
Looking forwardPerhaps the best news of all in Gilead's second-quarter results was that the company upped its outlook for full-year 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales between $24 billion and $25.5 billion, up from the $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion range previously projected.There were two reasons behind this positive change in outlook. First, Gilead now thinks that its non-hepatitis C revenue will come in between $15 billion and $15.5 billion instead of the $15.5 billion to $16 billion range previously given. Second, and more important, the company expects hep C sales for 2017 will be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion. Previously, Gilead had anticipated hep C revenue of $7.5 billion to $9 billion.This boost to guidance doesn't mean that Gilead has turned the corner with its hep C franchise, of course. However, it's certainly good news for a biotech that has been sorely in need of something positive.
Gilead goes into the second half of 2017 with a large cash position and tremendous cash flow. Its HIV franchise continues to be strong, and its pipeline looks pretty solid. The primary questions that remains are when Gilead will make an acquisition -- and which company (or companies) will be scooped up.   10 stocks we like better than Gilead SciencesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        Gilead Sciences, Inc. Boosts Its Full-Year Outlook Thanks to Stronger-Than-Expected Hep C Sales
    


newsfeedback@fool.com (Keith Speights)

            Jul 26, 2017
        Updated Jul 26, 2017





































































































When Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ: GILD) reported its first-quarter results earlier this year, everyone expected sales for the biotech's hepatitis C franchise to be way down. Those expectations were met in spades. The primary good news was that Gilead's HIV drug sales were up, although not nearly enough to offset the hep C decline.Gilead provided an update on its second-quarter performance after the market closed on Wednesday. Again, expectations were for lower hep C sales. There were some hopes, though, that the rate of decline would at least slow, and that Gilead's HIV drugs would pick up momentum. Here are the highlights of what actually happened during the second quarter.Image source: Getty Images.
Gilead Sciences results: The raw numbersMetric Q2 2017 Q2 2016 Year-Over-Year ChangeSales $7.14 billion$7.78 billion (8.2%)Net income from continuing operations $3.07 billion$3.5 billion (12.1%)Adjusted EPS $2.56$3.08 (16.9%)Data source: Gilead Sciences. What happened with Gilead Sciences this quarter?As expected, Gilead's hepatitis C franchise again dragged down the company's overall financial results in the second quarter. Hep C revenue fell 27.5% year over year to $2.9 billion -- but the rate of decline slowed from the first quarter. Strong growth for Epclusa partially offset the continued plunge in sales for Harvoni and Sovaldi.What investors should have expected in the biotech's second-quarter results were improving sales for Gilead's newer HIV drugs. That turned out to be a reasonable expectation, with climbing sales for Genvoya, Descovey, and Odefsey more than making up for lower sales of older HIV drugs Truvada, Atripla, and Stribild. Overall, Gilead's HIV franchise generated revenue of $3.6 billion in the second quarter, a 16.1% jump over the prior-year period.Gilead also enjoyed solid growth outside of its antiviral product lineup. Revenue from the company's other products beyond hep C and HIV totaled $607 million in the second quarter, a 15.6% year-over-year increase.Another thing investors probably anticipated was a nice boost to Gilead's cash stockpile. The big biotech didn't disappoint, reporting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of nearly $36.6 billion, up from $34 billion at the end of the first quarter.Gilead's major developments during the second quarter included a couple of significant pipeline milestones. On July 18, the Food and Drug Administration approved hepatitis C combo Vosevi. The European Committee for the Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) also gave a positive opinion for the drug. In addition, Gilead submitted its promising bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide combo for treating HIV for U.S. regulatory approval. 
Looking forwardPerhaps the best news of all in Gilead's second-quarter results was that the company upped its outlook for full-year 2017. Gilead now expects net product sales between $24 billion and $25.5 billion, up from the $22.5 billion to $24.5 billion range previously projected.There were two reasons behind this positive change in outlook. First, Gilead now thinks that its non-hepatitis C revenue will come in between $15 billion and $15.5 billion instead of the $15.5 billion to $16 billion range previously given. Second, and more important, the company expects hep C sales for 2017 will be between $8.5 billion and $9.5 billion. Previously, Gilead had anticipated hep C revenue of $7.5 billion to $9 billion.This boost to guidance doesn't mean that Gilead has turned the corner with its hep C franchise, of course. However, it's certainly good news for a biotech that has been sorely in need of something positive.
Gilead goes into the second half of 2017 with a large cash position and tremendous cash flow. Its HIV franchise continues to be strong, and its pipeline looks pretty solid. The primary questions that remains are when Gilead will make an acquisition -- and which company (or companies) will be scooped up.   10 stocks we like better than Gilead SciencesWhen investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies which were developing drugs to treat patients with pulmonary diseases. The company currently produces a range of commercially available products, most notably the Hepatitis C drugs: Harvoni and Sovaldi.[4]
Headquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. As of the end of 2015, the company had approximately 7,900 full-time employees.[5][6] Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.
The company's name and logo refer to the Balm of Gilead, inspired by a 1965 play by Lanford Wilson featuring the underworld adventures of the patrons of the namesake cafe.

 Gregg Alton of Gilead Sciences & others, "The Evolution of HIV/AIDS Therapies: A Conversation", 2012, Chemical Heritage Foundation


Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.[7][8][9] Riordan graduated from Washington University, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School.[10][11][12] Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.[13] Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman.[9] Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.[14]
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines.[15][16] Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.[17] Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.[18]
1990-1999: IPO[edit]
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.
In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.
In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,[19] but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.
In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.
2000-2009: Growth through acquisition[edit]
In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada.[20] The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.
In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,[21] also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.
In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.[22][23] Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.[24] Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then it's largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.
Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.[25]
In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.[26] Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes.
Present decade[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.[27]
In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.[28] Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).
On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.[29]
In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.
In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:

It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[30]
It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.[31]
It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.[32]

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.[33][34]
Sovaldi and Harvoni[edit]
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. Forbes magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.[35] Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,[36] and Barron's noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.[37]
On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.[38] The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.[39] For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.[40]
Merck & Co. combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir and marketed the treatment as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).[41] By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.[42]
Prospects for the future[edit]
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.[43] Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.[44] Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.[45]

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Liz and I will be your conference operator today. I would now like to turn the call over to Sung Lee, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Sung Lee - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon everyone. Just after market close today, we issued a press release with earnings results for the second quarter 2017. The press release and detailed slides are available on the Investor Relations section of the Gilead website. The speakers on today's call will be Robin Washington, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Young, Chief Operating Officer; Norbert Bischofberger, Executive Vice President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer; and John Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer.
Before we begin formal remarks, let me remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements including plans and expectations with respect to products, product candidates, financial projections and the use of capital, all of which involve certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found in the latest SEC disclosure documents and recent press releases. In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
Non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help you understand the company's underlying business performance. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in the earnings press release as well is on the Gilead website.
I will now turn the call over to Robin.
Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Thank you, Sung, and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to provide you with an update for our second quarter. I'll review the financial results, Kevin will address the commercial performance, Norbert will highlight the progress made in R&D, and then John will make a few closing comments.
Our strong performance in the second quarter was driven by a continuation of the positive trends in our non-HCV business and better than expected results from our HCV business, particularly in the U.S. Total revenues for the second quarter were $7.1 billion, with non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.56. This compares to revenues of $7.8 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.08 for the same period last year.
Product sales for the second quarter were $7 billion, down 8% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was due to lower HCV sales partially offset by increased sales in HIV and other therapeutic areas. Sequentially, HCV sales grew 11% and HIV and other therapeutic area sales grew 10%.
Turning to the U.S., product sales for the second quarter were $5 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by favorable demand for our non-HCV products offset by lower HCV sales, and up 12% sequentially, primarily due to the continued strong uptake of our TAF franchise and favorable inventory movements for HIV and HCV.

Turning to Europe, product sales for the second quarter were $1.4 billion, down 13% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year decline was primarily due to competitive dynamics in HCV and unfavorable currency movements. The sequential increase was primarily due to the one-time recognition of deferred revenue related to an HCV contract, demand for Epclusa and the continued uptake of our TAF-based regimens. Kevin will provide more color for the U.S. as well as the other regions.
Now turning to expenses. Non-GAAP R&D expenses were $812 million for the second quarter, down 22% compared to the same period last year, due primarily to the purchase of an FDA priority review voucher in 2016. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $827 million for the second quarter compared to $838 million in the same period last year.
We remain focused on operating in a highly efficient manner and are proactively managing expenses and investing in areas of strategic importance to generate industry-leading operating margins, significant cash flows and a strong balance sheet.
We ended the quarter with $36.6 billion in cash and investments and generated cash flows from operations of $3.5 billion. While we anticipate strong cash flows in the second half of 2017, we expect a sequential decrease in the second half of the year as we anticipate large cash payments for government rebates, both in the U.S. and abroad, as well as other seasonal payments.
As part of our plan to return capital to our shareholders, we paid cash dividends of $680 million and repurchased 2 million shares of stock for $130 million to offset dilution in the second quarter. We continue to prioritize the use of capital for investing in the long-term growth of our business including partnerships and acquisitions.
Finally, I would like to update our full-year 2017 guidance provided to you on May 2 and summarized on slide 6 in the earnings results presentation available on our corporate website. We are increasing net product sales to a range of $24 billion to $25.5 billion. Non-HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $15.5 billion to $16 billion. HCV net product sales are expected to be in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion.
This guidance reflects the strong performance we have seen in the first half of 2017 across our businesses, specifically in the U.S., while continuing to anticipate increased competitive dynamics in the U.S. and EU during the second half of the year.
This guidance is subject to a number of uncertainties which are highlighted on slide 16 in the earnings results presentation, including the accuracy of our estimates for HCV patient starts for the remainder of 2017, unanticipated pricing pressures from payers and competitors resulting in lower than anticipated market share in HCV, and lower than expected market share and greater price erosion as the result of the introduction of generic versions of TDF and the fixed-dose combination of FTC/TDF outside the U.S.
We are narrowing the R&D expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. We are also narrowing the SG&A expense guidance to a range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. Finally, the diluted earnings per share impact of GAAP to non-GAAP adjustments is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.93. All other components of our guidance remain unchanged.
I would now turn the call over to Kevin to provide more details on our commercial results for the quarter.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Thank you, Robin, and good afternoon everyone. We continue to see strong uptake of our TAF-based regimens in the United States and Europe. In the U.S., total HIV and HBV revenues were $2.6 billion for the quarter, up 19% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. These results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our HIV franchise.

At the end of June, our TAF-based regimens accounted for 51% of Gilead's total HIV prescription volume. Leading the way was Genvoya with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%, more than twice that of the second-most prescribed therapy. This represents the highest treatment-naïve patient share for a single product or regimen since the early days of Atripla.
In addition, more than one third of patients who switch HIV therapy now switch to Genvoya. More broadly, Gilead single tablet regimens represented four of the top five most prescribed products across all categories, treatment-naïve, switch and total treated patients.
Beyond TAF, Truvada for PrEP continues to be an important option when used as part of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV transmission. We estimate that approximately 136,000 people in the U.S. were using Truvada for PrEP as we exited the second quarter. We are also encouraged to see third-party providers announcing new initiatives on broadening access to PrEP.
Turning to Europe, total HIV and HBV revenues were $732 million in the second quarter, down 3% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease was driven by negative foreign exchange. The sequential increase was due to robust demand for our HIV therapies.
Strong uptake of our TAF franchise continues throughout Europe. Based on preliminary data for the second quarter, Genvoya is expected to be the most prescribed therapy for both treatment-naïve and switch patients across the top five European markets collectively. I'm delighted to say that in France, the largest HIV market in Europe, Genvoya became the most prescribed HIV regimen for treatment-naïve and switch patients just four months after launch.
Turning to Descovy and Odefsey. We now have these products available in 19 and 16 European countries respectively. Additional launches are anticipated in 2017 as pricing and reimbursement discussions continue. Guidelines have a significant impact on prescribing patterns. Following the recent inclusion in France, Genvoya is now a preferred regimen in country guidelines in all five of the major European markets.
Turning to HCV, total revenues in the U.S. were $1.9 billion in the second quarter, down 17% year-over-year and up 13% sequentially. The quarter-on-quarter increase was primarily due to a change in inventory and the timing of patient starts. Our market share for the quarter remained high at approximately 80%.
HCV patient starts in the first six months were better than we originally anticipated. As a result, while we still expect a gradual decline over the second half of the year, we estimate total U.S. market starts to be 185,000 to 200,000 for 2017. Approximately 9 million individuals were tested for HCV in 2016, a 15% increase from 2015.
As you may recall, we launched an educational campaign in October of last year to encourage baby boomers to get tested. Our research shows that there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. As testing has increased, so has diagnosis. Approximately 190,000 people were newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, a 32% increase from 2015. This reinforces our belief that there is a significant opportunity to treat and cure many HCV infected individuals for years to come. Gilead is committed to raising disease awareness and urging all individuals at risk for or living with HCV to talk to their health care provider.
Turning to Europe, total HCV revenue in the second quarter was $591 million, down 24% year-over-year and up 21% from the previous quarter. As Robin mentioned, the quarter-on-quarter increase was due to the one-time recognition of a deferred revenue related to an HCV contract.
Gilead patient starts were approximately 23,000 for the quarter, as declining trends in early launch countries were offset by the opening of access in other markets. With the addition of France, Italy and Spain earlier this year, all five major European markets have now agreed to expand access to patients regardless of fibrosis score. This means that there are now 16 European countries that allow patient access regardless of disease severity.

We are seeing rapid uptake of Epclusa, mirroring the same success we had some nine months ago in the U.S. Epclusa is quickly becoming the standard of care for HCV patients with genotypes 2 and 3, and reimbursement has been achieved in 21 countries.
While many people have been diagnosed with HCV and cured, there remain millions of people infected with HCV throughout Europe. In Germany, there are over 100,000 people estimated to be infected with HCV who are unaware that they have the disease. In partnership with the German Liver Foundation, Gilead has launched its first large multichannel disease awareness campaign to communicate that HCV can affect anyone and encourage all individuals at risk to talk to their health care provider.
Looking to the second half of 2017, and with the launch of Vosevi, we believe that Gilead has the most comprehensive portfolio of products to meet the needs of almost all hepatitis C patients, regardless of disease severity, regardless of genotype and regardless of prior treatment.
Finally, as I highlighted last quarter, our U.S. cardiopulmonary team is delivering consistently impressive results. They embody the same tenets of operational excellence as our HIV and liver teams. Letairis and Ranexa revenue total $430 million for the quarter.
I would now like to turn the call over to Norbert.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Thank you, Kevin. Earlier this week we announced the exciting results presented at the IAS meeting in Paris from two Phase 3 studies, studies 1489 and 1490 evaluating a fixed dose combination of B/F/TAF compared to the triple-therapy regimens containing dolutegravir among treatment-naïve patients.
In Study 1489, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B/F/TAF or the fixed-dose combination of abacavir, dolutegravir, lamivudine, and in Study 1490, adults with HIV were randomized to receive B/F/TAF or dolutegravir plus F/TAF. In both studies, B/F/TAF met its primary objective of non-inferiority as defined by the proportion of patients who achieved biological suppression. There was no treatment-emerging resistance through 48 weeks. B/F/TAF was well tolerated and no patients discontinued study medication due to renal events in either study.
Additionally, no new safety signals were observed, and the nature and incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities was similar among treatment groups with the exception of nausea in Study 1489 which occurred with higher frequency in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm. It was also reported at the conference that in Study 1489 there were more patient self-reported neurological and constitutional adverse events in the abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine arm.
These results reinforce the value of pairing bictegravir, an unboosted integrase inhibitor with a high barrier to resistance, with the demonstrated long-term safety profile of the F/TAF backbone, addressing the limitations of current HIV therapy. B/F/TAF could represent an important advance in the triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients including the aging population and those with mild to moderate renal impairment.
Last month, Gilead filed a new drug application for B/F/TAF with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration based on data from studies 1489 and 1490 and two other ongoing studies evaluating the single-tablet regimen in virologically suppressed patients.
In both these studies, patients were randomized to either switch to B/F/TAF or remain on their existing regimen, which in one study is a triple-therapy regimen containing abacavir-dolutegravir-lamivudine, and the other study, a regimen of two nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors and a boosted protease inhibitor. We plan to present data from these studies at scientific meetings later this year. In addition to these four studies, we have one other study ongoing where patients on dolutegravir and Descovy are randomized to stay on that regimen or switch to B/F/TAF.

In the European Union, Gilead's marketing authorization application for B/F/TAF was fully validated earlier this month and is now under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.
With regards to HIV prevention research, we're pleased to report that the DISCOVER trial is now fully enrolled ahead of schedule with more than 5,000 participants across North America and Europe. The DISCOVER study randomized patients to receive Truvada or Descovy to evaluate whether Descovy is safe and effective at reducing the risk of HIV infection when used as a pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Turning to NASH, two Phase 3 trials, STELLAR 3 and STELLAR 4 are underway, evaluating selonsertib, which is our ASK-1 inhibitor in patients with F3 bridging fibrosis and F4 cirrhosis. Enrollment in these studies is going well, and since initiating the studies in March of this year, we have already screened more than 1,000 patients. We're confident that these studies will be fully enrolled in the first half of 2018.
Recall that in a phase 2 study, selonsertib was shown to reverse fibrosis and decrease fibrosis progression in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, two other compounds with different mechanisms of action, an ACC inhibitor, GS-0976, and an FXR agonist GS-9674, are currently in Phase 2 with data readouts anticipated in the second half of this year. We're also exploring combinations of the three agents in Phase 2a studies.
In oncology, a Phase 3 study of andecaliximab, which is our anti-MMP-9 antibody in patients with gastric cancer is ongoing and interim futility analysis from this study will be conducted later this year. In addition, the Phase 2a study has been initiated to evaluate combinations of our BTK inhibitor, tirabrutinib, with our PI3K inhibitor, idelalisib, and our Syk inhibitor, entospletinib, in combination with obinutuzumab in patients with relapsed refractory CLL. We're also evaluating entospletinib in a Phase 2 study in acute myeloid leukemia.
In inflammation, five Phase 3 studies of filgotinib are ongoing in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 study with filgotinib in combination with GS-9876, a Syk inhibitor.
In summary, significant progress has been made with many of our programs. Four molecules are continuing in Phase 3, including the Descovy for PrEP, Selonsertib for NASH, filgotinib for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and we expect to see a number of regulatory and clinical milestones in the second half of this year.
I would now like to turn over the call to John.
John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Thanks, Norbert. I'm going to keep my remarks brief so we can get your questions. I do want to emphasize the importance of Norbert's comment a few moments ago. We've made tremendous strides with antiretroviral therapy over the past two decades. But still today every treatment option available has some compromise, be that a food requirement, the risk of side effects, tolerability, the emergence of viral resistance or a potential interaction with another medication.
Those trade-offs and compromises that people living with HIV and their healthcare providers have to make may be minimized to perhaps the greatest extent possible with B/F/TAF. This is why we're so encouraged by the data presented at the IAS Conference in Paris this week and by the data in patients switching from other HIV medications that will be presented at scientific meetings later this year.
I'd also like to take this time to congratulate our partner, Janssen, for the positive CHMP opinion on Symtuza, a single-tablet regimen containing darunavir, cobicistat, emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide, or TAF. When approved by the European commission, Symtuza will be the first commercially available STR containing a protease inhibitor, an important option for patients who previously had to consume two or more tablets every day.

Turning to HCV, last month the CHMP issued a positive opinion on Gilead's application for marketing authorization for Vosevi. Then just last week, the U.S. FDA approved Vosevi for the treatment of HCV genotypes 1 through 6 in patients who virus rebounded during or after treatment with an NS5A inhibitor and in patients with genotypes 1a and 3 who have been previously treated with a sofosbuvir-containing regimen. The approval is three weeks ahead of the PDUFA date and marks Gilead's fourth HCV therapy approval in three-and-a-half years.
We commenced our launch plan immediately upon notification by FDA. Bottles of Vosevi were shipped to wholesalers last week and it is now available in pharmacies. We are aware that prescriptions were written within hours of the approval and are pleased that many patients who have run out of options and are worried about the progression of their liver disease will now have another chance to be cured of their HCV infection.
We had a strong second quarter, and as you heard from Norbert, our pipeline is growing and maturing in HIV, NASH, inflammatory diseases and oncology. We are looking ahead to a number of exciting clinical milestones in the second half of this year and the continued progression of the B/F/TAF regulatory review in the U.S., Europe and other countries.
I want to take this opportunity to thank Gilead's 9.000 employees for the incredible focus, hard work and execution over the first half of this year.
In the interest of time. let's now open the call for questions. Operator?
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Our first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays.
Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter. Got one for Kevin or Norbert. So the Genvoya launch continues to look really, really good. But I wanted to know, now that you have the bictegravir data in hand, one, how are you thinking about positioning relative to Genvoya; and two, is there enough differentiation versus dolutegravir to take share that you didn't get with Genvoya? Thanks.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hey, Geoff. Thank you for the question. I should say straightaway that not in the room today is Jim Meyers, our Executive Vice President for Commercial Operations, because actually Jim has been in Paris these last few days. He's heading back today and he certainly relayed to us the excitement around Bic/F/TAF. We've had several key opinion leader advisory boards and I think the data that we've presented them from the first two studies have been exceedingly well received.
Having said that, Geoff, we've made a flying start with Genvoya. I don't think we could be happier. As I said in my script, over half of our patients are now TAF-based in the U.S., and we have a range of different conversions in Europe, but somewhere like Germany, it was our first country, is now upwards of 65%. So we're thrilled with the adoption of Genvoya.
Not only that, Descovy and Odefsey, and as I think I've said in the past, the success of Bic/F/TAF is on the platform of the adoption of Descovy-based regimens. So we consider this a total family. We're still really excited about Bic/F/TAF. Nothing has changed. The data is reinforced so we got tremendous product. It's a beautiful small pill and we think it can be very strongly additive to our F/TAF portfolio of drugs. So as far as we're concerned, we're now going to be moving to very high gear for the launch of that new regimen come 2018.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yeah, Geoff, you asked about differentiation from dolutegravir. If you look at the results from Study 1490, the two, so comparing dolutegravir F/TAF to B/F/TAF, the two drugs are virologically identical. Adverse events, laboratory abnormalities are the same, the real differentiation is we have one single pill co-formulated, one co-pay, one pill. That's the big differentiation from dolutegravir.

Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley.
Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC
So thanks, thanks very much. I was on mute for a second there. I guess if I could ask, you called out, I guess, the broad question here is around what you're seeing in the HCV market and sort of sustainability of the revenues that you've talked about. And related to that, could you just comment, I think you called out a couple one-time items, but you didn't disclose the size of the inventory or the size of the 1X tenants (31:31). If you'd be willing to just – if you're not willing to disclose that number, could you just give us an idea of the relative size of those? That would be helpful. Thanks.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hey, Matthew. It's Kevin. I'll kick off and then Robin can add to my comments. We're very pleased that there is this increased number of patients that have started in the first half of the year. I think naturally we were careful and sensitive in going into 2017. A cure market has surprises on the way up and it certainly surprises on the way down. So I think we took a very careful approach to what might happen in 2017. It is clear that more patients are starting than we had predicted in our guidance, and as I said in my opening remarks, we now think it's going to be in the range of 185,000 to 200,000 patients. So clearly that's very positive.
The other thing I would say is my comments on identifying HCV-infected individuals. If you think about it, as we're treating and curing patients, we want to make sure that the patients infected are coming into the system, albeit that they generally seem to be less ill than they were a few years ago. But it's important to still keep the movement of patients coming through. And as I said, we still consider this a large market, a very important market for Gilead, albeit that we still think there is a gradual trend down and where that sort of turns the corner or bottoms out, right now, still remains to be seen.
Robin L. Washington - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hi, Matt. And to answer the other part of your question, the specific items that we called out. So on HCV, in the U.S., we did talk about inventory. And I would say that trend is not any different than what we've typically seen in HIV. I think we'd not called them out in the past because we typically had other changes that somewhat masked them. But with a sequential change or with a sequential kind of stabilization of pricing as well as patient starts and market share, that shift in inventory is just more noticeable. But the same IMA agreements are in place for HIV exists, that the ranges for our overall inventory were maintained quarter-on-quarter.
And keep in mind, with the Epclusa launch last fall, just that ongoing volatility until you get to steady state is what we see the dynamics impacting us where we had kind of an inventory build here, given inventory adjustments the last couple of quarters. I just want to emphasize that despite the inventory change, that the real underlying driver is just what Kevin talked about in the U.S. It's really increased patient starts, and so the inventory change was just one component of the over-performance.
In EU, the other area we called out was the one-time deferred revenue recognition from a volume-based contract agreement that we had in Italy that expired. So we had been recognizing revenue a little conservative to-date, and so we had a catch-up one-time adjustment. If you take that out, the HCV revenue for Europe sequentially would been about flat.

Our next question comes from Geoff Porges with Leerink Partners.

Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks very much. Two very quick questions. I apologize, but could you, Robin, could you let us know when we should anticipate the first generic Truvada in the U.S. given your agreement with Teva? At least, can we anticipate that it won't be in the next 18 months? And secondly, Norbert, I'm sure you've looked very hard at the filgotinib clinical experience to-date, and could you comment on whether you've seen any thromboembolic events? Any imbalance in such events? Or whether you believe in any way it's related to JAK kinase inhibition?
John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
So specifically to the first question, Geoff, it's John Milligan. With regard to generic Truvada, we don't expect generic Truvada in the United States until 2021.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Okay. Thanks. That's very helpful.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yes, Geoff, we have looked, of course, at our database since the news was announced by Lilly and Incyte, and we have found a total of three thromboembolic events. This is, by the way, in a database of 1,900 patient years of experience. One of the events was, by the investigator said, not related to the study drug because it was recurrent. This was pulmonary embolism. One of them was unlikely, and one of them was possible.
So it's really a small number. And as you also know, thrombolic events, inflammatory conditions in general are not unusual.
But I would like to point out, we are, in our filgotinib study, I think we have de-risked the program by pursuing two doses. This is something that FDA asked us to do. We agreed. And so if there should be a difference between the two doses, we will see it.
Geoff, I would like to add another quick – this is more speculation and hypothesis. If you believe that these events that Lilly saw are drug-related, so that's of course a big question, because they saw a total of five.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Yes.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
The second is if you then believe that they have to do with high platelet numbers, this then all kind of makes sense because baricitinib makes platelets go up. Filgotinib in contrast shows a platelet decrease. So if this is real and if this is the mechanism, then we should not be seeing this. Again, this is somewhat speculative and hypothesis.
Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC
Thanks very much for the two questions.

Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.
Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a very solid quarter. I guess, Kevin, I just want to dig a little bit more into the trends we're seeing in Europe. I saw that Genvoya rose up to the top position in naïves, and I guess I just want to know a little bit more under the hood of what's driving the dynamics there in Europe for HIV. Thanks.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hi, Alethia. Thank you for the comments. Yeah, we're delighted with the quarter. I think it was just all round solid across regions, all our products are. I also salute Norbert for some incredible milestones on the R&D front. So we're really pleased with where we are as a company in the middle of the year.
Yes, Genvoya is now starting to exhibit across the countries the same performance that we are having in the U.S. The extreme of that is Germany. We're having very good uptake in Spain and Italy. And of course as I highlighted, France has done extraordinarily well just in four months to become the leading naïve and switch product.
The other thing I should say, Alethia, is that Descovy in itself is doing very, very well in Europe. There are one or two markets that don't have the level of STRs that we have here in the United States, if you take somewhere like Germany. So Descovy itself is doing very well and we're happy to have that switch from Truvada to Descovy because it's a great platform for B/F/TAF in the future. So I think we're very pleased to be where we are and I only see great momentum across the European countries.

Our next question comes from Brian Skorney with Robert Baird.
Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, I know if I asked you what company you're going to buy, you'd tell me, but I think the market should keep guessing, so I'm going to ask something else. The new diagnosis rates in HCV are pretty impressive, but I wonder if you could characterize the trends you're seeing in access in the U.S. and maybe provide some characterization of what type of patients are being diagnosed. It never seemed like actual patient diagnosed volume is an issue, so are these patients that are being diagnosed or do you think that are accessible from the current payer situation, and is the payer situation improving from your point of view?
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Maybe, Brian, I could start with that. We're not seeing a great deal of change. Pretty much the patients are, if you like, settling down. They are naïve to therapy, lower fibrosis scores. Generally we have about the same access that we had in terms of start of the year. So there has not been any big, fundamental changes. I think there are still a proportion of patients somewhere in the region of 20% to 25% who do get diagnosed with quite advanced disease. But on a general basis they are fitter than the established patients that were there in doctors' offices and have been sat there for a long time waiting for a new treatment. So that's kind of bad news/good news because we do eventually believe that they will come through the system and make this a long-term market for us.
Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
I think my question was just really meant more around the new patients are – I mean, are we looking at the spike in patients, are these patients that are diagnosed who are incarcerated, or is it heterogeneous and kind of the standard? So I want to know, is the spike in new diagnosis, is it actually going to pay off or is it in a patient population that's more or less inaccessible to branded products right now?
John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Brian, most of the folks who are seeking diagnosis are people who have access to very, very good medical care. This is not about incarceration. The rate of treatment of incarcerated individuals is still exceedingly low in this country, something that we're focusing on but have had very little traction on. So people who we're seeking, essentially the baby boomers who we're seeking, typically have very good healthcare or Medicare.
Brian P. Skorney - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.
Okay, thanks.
John F. Milligan - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
And so this a very good, accessible population.

Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas with Citibank.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe we could just follow-up and ask a little bit more about what's going on in the HIV market and who is switching. Who is not switching to these new therapies in the United States? And what percentage of switch is coming from Triumeq or Tivicay regimens?
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hi, Robyn. Nice to hear your voice again. Congratulations on I think the addition to your family.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
So great to have you back. Really the results are very positive across the board. As I said, about 30% of switches come to Genvoya. When you start to break down the rest of it, it tends to be kind of a mishmash, a whole bunch of other switches. In terms of your question about how much of Genvoya comes from non-Gilead regimens, that's just over, that's 10% to 11% and that's stayed fairly constant since we launched Genvoya. So that's all additive to us. It's very positive and I think that will probably stay about where it is.

So I wouldn't say there's any particular new dynamics. The switch continues to be the biggest part of the HIV market and Genvoya is clearly leading the products in the go-to switch regimen. Overall, I think we're just absolutely delighted that physicians see the benefit of having their patients on long-term TAF-based regimens good for the suppression of HIV and obviously good for their kidneys and good for the bones.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
And as a follow up, do you think there's anyone – do you have a sense yet that there's a percentage of people that you will not be able to switch? Or when do you think you'll have a good sense of maybe a part of the market that will not be switching to these new therapies? Will it take the launch of the F/TAF for you to understand that or do you think you kind of have a sense of that right now?
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Well we do hope Genvoya is going to keep going up until we bring in the F/TAF in 2018. Robin, there are certain patients who are just very familiar with their therapies. I dare say there's still going to be some Atripla patients, Stribild patients, Complera patients. They're just comfortable. Even after discussion with their physician, sometimes patients don't want to switch. And also don't forget, you've got a smaller proportion of patients who are on the PI regimens and sometimes physicians who feel that they perhaps might not be quite as adherent prefer them to be on a PI-based regimen. So there may not be the patients who come across.
Robyn Karnauskas - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.
Thank you.

Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.
Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to go back to HIV again. In some of the doublet data that was presented at IAS, there was a very small subset of patients that experienced resistance mutations, secondary to extreme nonadherence. I'm curious as to your views on this and whether you think it's a meaningful finding or just noise. Thanks.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yes, Cory, thanks for the question. It's Norbert. There's no doubt that both dolutegravir and 3TC are proven long-term tolerable and safe drugs. The question that everybody has, are the two by themselves enough to chronically suppress virus replication in a broad patient population irrespective of baseline viral load and irrespective of partial adherence. And I think the data that were presented at IAS, ACTG 5353 has put that into doubt. Even though these patients were non-adherent, the one especially that developed the 263 mutation, the fact is this is real life. These patients do exist. Not all patients are adherent all the time. And we just have to wait for long-term two-year data to really answer this question.
By the way, if you look at the detailed slides, there were actually five patients that had virological failure if you use the FDA definition of greater than 50 copies per ml at week 24, and it was at week 24 analysis. So again, we need to see more data and I know that the Phase 3 studies are ongoing, the GEMINI studies and hopefully we'll get the answer from that. But as I said, at this point I have great doubts whether that dolutegravir/3TC is enough to cover a broad patient population.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Cory, it's Kevin here. If you get virological failure and resistance in a controlled clinical setting in a study, then I don't know what might happen in real life. It's important to say that with the large numbers of HIV patients that are treated these days, many have quite chaotic personal lives in terms of housing and the need for social care, and they are very challenged. And I think it's important that those type of patients really do get robust therapies that do our very best to avoid them getting into difficult situations of failure.

Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC
All right. Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one for Norbert. We heard from some physicians attending IAS this week that there's a small but potentially meaningful difference in CNS studies such as sleep quality or disturbance or insomnia. How meaningful is that in the real practice? Do you think that you can make a differentiation between bictegravir and the Tivicay or Triumeq regimen?
And then secondly, maybe for Kevin, we're expecting AbbVie to obtain FDA approval probably this quarter for their once-daily one pill regimen for HCV. What's the outlook for market share and also the pricing dynamics once AbbVie enters the market with another one pill once-daily regimen for HCV? Thank you.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yes. So, Ying, in Study 1489, which was the trial mate to bictegravir B/F/TAF comparison, there were clearly more adverse, self-reported adverse events that had to do with sleep disturbance, nausea, et cetera, on the abacavir-containing arm. But in the second, Study 1490, the incidence was similar. So our interpretation is that what we are seeing in terms of CNS-related effects and constitutional general well being has to do with abacavir. The comparison of bictegravir to dolutegravir did not really show a difference, and I cannot at this point tell you what bictegravir does in terms of CNS side effects.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hey, Ying. It's Kevin. In answer to your question, we just don't know. We're just sort of two weeks before their FDA PDUFA date. We'll just have to cross some bridges when we see their label, we see their pricing, we see how they begin to promote the product, perhaps eventually see how they come on the market with their contracting strategies. So I think there are unknowns, and we'll just have to wait and see.
I can only really control the areas that we have with our products, and I think we feel reassured by the portfolio of HCV products. Now we have Vosevi added to that. I think we have a tremendous offering in genotype 1, 2 and 3. Epclusa, as Robin mentioned, is doing really, really well, both here and now it's coming on-stream in Europe and we'll be able to also help the small number of patients who failed other therapies with Vosevi. So I think we're in a good position, and we're certainly going to continue with our very solid and very substantial promotion of our products.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Ying, I would like to add, if you look at the data on (52:34), they had excellent clinical results in genotype 1 in treatment-naïve very early disease mostly F0 and F1. Actually, 80% of the population was F0 and F1 and in treatment-naïve patients. But the data in the other genotypes and also in treatment-experienced and cirrhotic patients were less good, particularly if you look at genotype 3 where they compared in eight weeks to 12 weeks to 12 weeks of sofosbuvir/daclatasvir, the regimen that had the most virological failures was the eight weeks of the AbbVie dual followed by the 12 weeks of the AbbVie dual, and the best-performing regimen was actually sofosbuvir/daclatasvir. So as Kevin said, we just have to really look at what the U.S. label will look like, then we will be in a better position to comment on the competitive nature.

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with Jefferies.
Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC
Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks. I have two R&D questions. One is on filgotinib, where you mentioned there was an interim analysis in UC in the first half of 2018. Can you just remind us a bit on that and what the importance is of that in terms of that interim? And then secondly, on FXR, you have a Phase 2 coming up soon in PBC. I wanted to understand your confidence in terms of efficacy and differentiation and what you would want to see to move forward in NASH? Thanks.

Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yeah, thank you, Michael. No, the interim analysis was not on filgotinib, it was on the MMP9 antibody andecaliximab. And that interim analysis is an analysis when we will have reached 30% of the endpoints, and the endpoint is death. So it's overall survival, and that will happen later this year. And we have a hazard ratio pre-specified, so it's more a futility analysis. If we don't reach a minimal hazard ratio, then we will probably discontinue the study. But if the DSMB sees that has a ratio reached, they will simply recommended to continue the study. And the second question.
Michael J. Yee - Jefferies LLC
Maybe I'm just reading it wrong on slide 51, and so I'll follow up with you. On the top there it says filgotinib, Phase 3 UC interim. But we'll keep going.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Okay. Yes, we'll follow up with you afterwards. I don't have slide 51. And the other question had is about FXR agonist in PBC. We just have to see what the data looks like. But as you know, or may know, we are differentiated in terms of mechanism because we rely on intestinally generated FGF19 to essentially give you the efficacy. And we think some the side effects that have been seen with the other FXR agonist may have to do with systemic FXR agonism.
It's all hypothesis and the initial data that we have would actually support it. But if we were to see this, we could have an agent that is differentiated from a safety point of view. And the other thing you may probably also know, the compound that's approved currently has pretty severe limitations with regards to hepatic impairment. I think it has to be given, is it once a week? I don't remember, but it greatly increases the concentration of OCA. So those are the two areas of differentiation.

Our next question comes from Phil Nadeau with Cowen and Company.
Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC
Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the beat and raise in the quarter. One question on bictegravir's data that was presented earlier this week. When GSK was asked about bictegravir this morning, they highlighted the numeric differences in virologic suppression that we're seeing in Study 1490, although those differences weren't statistically significant. I guess along those lines, one, to what to do you attribute those differences? Two, how successful do you think you'll be in convincing physicians that they are not significant, using things like the missing excluded analysis that you showed in the poster. And three, do you even expect them to be on the label?
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Sure. So, Phil, this is actually very simple. You can have virological failure. There are three categories that fall into it. Number one, you come in at the week 48 visit and you truly have above 50 copies per ml, that's one virological failure. The second is if you discontinue and the physician indicates on the discontinuation form that you've discontinued for the lack of efficacy, that's number two. And the third category is, if you have discontinued at any point in time for administrative reason and your last measurement was greater than 50.
And now look at that third category. We had a total of 11 patients on the bictegravir arm versus three on the dolutegravir arm that discontinued due to administrative reason. And out of those 11, by the way, six only showed up at the first visit. So they showed up, first visit, took the drug and then we never saw them again. And the reason was various: they moved out of the area, they couldn't be reached anymore, they were incarcerated, things like that.
So we think this is a completely a non-issue and we will have no problems at all convincing physicians that this doesn't matter. These numbers will be in the label, absolutely. This is how FDA, in all HIV drugs, in all Phase 3 data categorizes thing. But it will be categorized exactly this: virological failure due to number one; two, virological failure, discontinued due to lack of efficacy; and number three, and that's the category I want to point your attention to, discontinued for other reasons and last measurement was greater than 50.

Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hey, Phil, it's Kevin. Just to also add, the real – the number one headline that is most important to opinion leaders, and therefore the HIV community, is zero resistance. When we have met with our KOLs, that is where they go to first, it's zero resistance, and of course, that is unlike the situation that occurred in ACTG 5353.
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yes, Phil, just another comment. You would of course expect in a large study like this that these random events would equally distribute between the two arms. Well, they didn't. As I said, there were 11 on the bictegravir arm versus three on the other arm. It's purely statistical coincidence and it has no meaning whatsoever clinically.

Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets.
M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on a great quarter. Really, just a question on the PrEP opportunity. If you could just quantify for us what the opportunity is today, whether it's in patient terms or dollar terms. And as we think about the DISCOVER study, what does that trial need to show for you to effectively transition these patients from Truvada to Descovy?
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hi, Ian. It's Kevin. I'll let Norbert answer the question on the DISCOVER study. But in terms just generally, compared to the few years ago, it's quite remarkable now how people are taking on board the benefits of PrEP and obviously avoiding infection. We've seen some remarkable work here in San Francisco. We see a lot of activity in New York, Miami, and we have taken those signals and put a larger field-based team out there to try and support the education around PrEP. So we're able to visit places now like Atlanta, Washington, DC and many other urban areas. About half of our Truvada sales in the U.S. are currently coming from PrEP, and we certainly expect that to grow.
If you look at our numbers this year compared to 2016, we're about 15% higher in terms of the use of Truvada for PrEP. And the other part of this is, it's not occasional monthly use of Truvada. We're starting to see persistency at a patient level that is close to matching normal HIV use of Truvada. So we're seeing a chronicity, a regular use among PrEP-using individuals.
And the final thing I would say, Ian, is that we are seeing other parties starting to announce that, for example, retail pharmacies are beginning initiatives that their pharmacist can engage in conversations on PrEP and what PrEP is about and educate people who come into a retail pharmacy to ask about PrEP medication. So that's also I think part of the momentum and movement that's going on right now.

Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Yeah, Ian, from a clinical point of view it's very simple. It's a non-inferiority study. We want to simply show that regarding efficacy-wise that F/TAF is the same as Truvada along with improved renal and bone parameters. And then because it's much easier and safer to use, you don't have to monitor creatinine. You don't have to look for people that are at risk for bone effects. You don't have to measure BMD, that it's a much preferred agent to Truvada. That's essentially what we're showing. That's why it takes 5,000 patients, by the way. It's not a small study to do.
M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Right. I guess, Norbert, what I was trying to understand is, is the patient sensitivity any different? Are they more sensitive or less sensitive to the adverse event profile of TAF given that they're – obviously don't carry the infection?
Norbert W. Bischofberger - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
No. Actually, Ian, so I don't have those data yet, but we answered that question when we did the PrEP studies with Truvada. There was a question that both we and the FDA had and the question was, can you take safety data from HIV-infected individuals and extrapolate the non-HIV infected, and the conclusion was you can't. So we generated data in about, I can't remember, 25,000 patients total that were not HIV infected, and that database convinced everybody that the safety is the same. There's no difference between HIV infected and non-HIV infected patients.

Salim Syed - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.
Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. Just on, when we're thinking about the tail for hepatitis C, I don't think (65:47) these numbers in a while but correct me if I'm wrong. There's 1.4 million patients treated and there was 4 million to begin with in the U.S. and people have previously thought there was 500,000 that are uninsured and untreated. Of the 2.6 million of which that 500,000 is part of, is there any other patient population as you guys have had more time pass that's not treatable here, or reasonably treatable?
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Hey, Salim. It's Kevin. We've always in the U.S. gone with figures that are about 3 million infected and about 1.5 million that are diagnosed. No, I don't think there's any sort of difference in our opinions of the market. There is a proportion of patients that is uninsured. There are a group of patients that are incarcerated. As John said earlier, we see very little treatment. We continue to have conversations with the various states around their systems of incarceration, but there doesn't seem to be much momentum about that.
We talked in the past about obviously the VA. The VA has been incredibly proactive. They've dedicated money. We are hearing, we don't have direct data, but we're hearing that it is slowing down a little bit like the general market, but they continue their efforts to outbound information and try and get people into the system. They're incredibly enthusiastic to try and heal their veterans. And there's the continuation, as John said, of the commercial markets and we certainly are doing our part to try and highlight to patients the need to be tested and that there are very comprehensive ways of curing the disease.
So I think for us to continue to do that at some point, at some point, there will be some equilibrium and that will still be a lot of patients. And with a incredible treatment that cures, payers, providers will be motivated to use therapies. So I don't think there has been any big ahas for us or particular opening of new patient groups in the past 12 months.

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Kevin, on the Get Tested campaign, is the expectation that screening volumes will still continue to grow meaningfully? Or should we expect that impact to plateau, and is it safe to say that program will continue unchanged when AbbVie enters the market? Thank you.
Kevin B. Young - Gilead Sciences, Inc.
Good question. Carter. I don't know what way. We could go higher. We always feel that part of our role in the areas, in our large areas that we operate is to provide education. As a reminder, our baby boomer campaign is not aired as much as our Harvoni campaign, but I think in general terms, yes we feel that it is important to continue to highlight that baby boomers potentially who have been in a situation of risk, that they might go and ask for a test and be screened and find out their status. Let's not forget that that principle is backed by the CDC and there is Gilead and there are many other parties that support baby boomers finding out their HCV status, and if they are positive, then to take the steps forward. So yes, we feel that as the leader in HCV, it is part and parcel of the role we play.

Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies which were developing drugs to treat patients with pulmonary diseases. The company currently produces a range of commercially available products, most notably the Hepatitis C drugs: Harvoni and Sovaldi.[4]
Headquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. As of the end of 2015, the company had approximately 7,900 full-time employees.[5][6] Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.
The company's name and logo refer to the Balm of Gilead, inspired by a 1965 play by Lanford Wilson featuring the underworld adventures of the patrons of the namesake cafe.

 Gregg Alton of Gilead Sciences & others, "The Evolution of HIV/AIDS Therapies: A Conversation", 2012, Chemical Heritage Foundation


Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.[7][8][9] Riordan graduated from Washington University, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School.[10][11][12] Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.[13] Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman.[9] Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.[14]
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines.[15][16] Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.[17] Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.[18]
1990-1999: IPO[edit]
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.
In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.
In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,[19] but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.
In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.
2000-2009: Growth through acquisition[edit]
In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada.[20] The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.
In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,[21] also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.
In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.[22][23] Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.[24] Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then it's largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.
Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.[25]
In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.[26] Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes.
Present decade[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.[27]
In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.[28] Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).
On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.[29]
In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.
In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:

It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[30]
It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.[31]
It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.[32]

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.[33][34]
Sovaldi and Harvoni[edit]
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. Forbes magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.[35] Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,[36] and Barron's noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.[37]
On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.[38] The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.[39] For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.[40]
Merck & Co. combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir and marketed the treatment as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).[41] By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.[42]
Prospects for the future[edit]
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.[43] Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.[44] Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.[45]

Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies which were developing drugs to treat patients with pulmonary diseases. The company currently produces a range of commercially available products, most notably the Hepatitis C drugs: Harvoni and Sovaldi.[4]
Headquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. As of the end of 2015, the company had approximately 7,900 full-time employees.[5][6] Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.
The company's name and logo refer to the Balm of Gilead, inspired by a 1965 play by Lanford Wilson featuring the underworld adventures of the patrons of the namesake cafe.

 Gregg Alton of Gilead Sciences & others, "The Evolution of HIV/AIDS Therapies: A Conversation", 2012, Chemical Heritage Foundation


Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.[7][8][9] Riordan graduated from Washington University, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School.[10][11][12] Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.[13] Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman.[9] Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.[14]
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines.[15][16] Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.[17] Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.[18]
1990-1999: IPO[edit]
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.
In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.
In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,[19] but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.
In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.
2000-2009: Growth through acquisition[edit]
In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada.[20] The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.
In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,[21] also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.
In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.[22][23] Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.[24] Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then it's largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.
Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.[25]
In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.[26] Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes.
Present decade[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.[27]
In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.[28] Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).
On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.[29]
In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.
In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:

It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[30]
It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.[31]
It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.[32]

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.[33][34]
Sovaldi and Harvoni[edit]
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. Forbes magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.[35] Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,[36] and Barron's noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.[37]
On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.[38] The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.[39] For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.[40]
Merck & Co. combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir and marketed the treatment as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).[41] By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.[42]
Prospects for the future[edit]
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.[43] Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.[44] Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.[45]

Gilead Sciences says late-stage results for HIV drug combination are similar to standard of care
Gilead Sciences Inc.  said early Monday that its HIV combination treatment had similar safety and efficacy results in two late-stage clinical trials to the standard of care. The data, along with two other late-stage clinical trials, are the basis of Gilead's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, the company said. The combination of the drugs bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is intended for patients who are new to treatment. One of the phase 3 studies, which enrolled 629 patients, found that 92.4% of patients on the BIC/FTC/TAF combination treatment achieved the primary endpoint at week 48, compared with 93% of patients achieving the primary endpoint on the other regimen. In the other study, which enrolled 645 patients, 89.4% of those on the BIC/FTC/TAF regimen and 92.9% of those on another regimen achieved the primary endpoint at week 48. In both studies, discontinuations due to adverse events were low, according to Gilead. Two studies looking at the combination in  virologically suppressed adult patients are ongoing and are also part of the company's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, Gilead said. Gilead shares surged 0.7% in pre-market trade before declining 0.2% pre-market. Shares have surged 11.3% over the last three months, compared with a 4.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Gilead says four late-stage trials of HIV drug combination met primary endpoints
Gilead Sciences Inc.  said pre-market Tuesday that an HIV drug combination met primary endpoints in four late-stage clinical trials. The company said it plans to file for approval in the U.S. and Europe this year. Gilead's combination, the drugs bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is intended to treat HIV-1 infection in a single tablet regimen, and the latest results "could represent an important advance in triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients," Gilead said. Two of the studies looked at the combination's efficacy and safety relative to another HIV drug in newly-diagnosed patients. The other two studies compared patients switching to the Gilead HIV combination to those on another regimen. HIV drugs, along with Hepatitis C drugs, have become an important part of Gilead's revenue stream. Shares were up a scant 0.3% in pre-market trade on Tuesday. Shares have dropped 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 1.9% rise in the S&P 500 .

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Atripla is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of Atripla have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which are components of Atripla. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Atripla. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

About HIV/AIDS
Infection with HIV-1, or human immunodeficiency virus, is one of the world’s greatest health challenges, currently affecting more than 35 million people worldwide. HIV progressively damages the immune system, weakening the body’s ability to fight life-threatening infections, which can lead to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

About 



                                                Complera® (emtricitabine 200 mg/rilpivirine 25 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 12 years of age and older with no antiretroviral treatment history and with HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL at the start of therapy, and in certain virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) adult patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen at start of therapy in order to replace their current antiretroviral treatment regimen.
                                            


Prescribing considerations in adults with no ARV treatment history:
Virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) was higher in subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and in subjects with baseline CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 (regardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA levels). Compared to efavirenz, virologic failure in rilpivirine-treated subjects conferred a higher rate of overall resistance and cross-resistance to the NNRTI class and more subjects developed tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance.
Prescribing considerations in virologically suppressed adults:
Patients must have no history of virologic failure, be stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) for ≥6 months prior to switching therapy, currently be on their first or second ARV regimen prior to switching therapy, and have no current or past history of resistance to any component of Complera.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

Complera is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of Complera have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which are components of Complera. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Complera. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

                                                Truvada® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients weighing at least 35 kg. Truvada is also indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Truvada:

Prescribing considerations when initiating TRUVADA for treatment of HIV-1 infection:
Do not use TRUVADA as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen or coadminister with other products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or lamivudine. Use of TRUVADA in treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history.
Prescribing Considerations before initiating TRUVADA for PrEP:
TRUVADA for PrEP must only be prescribed as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Reduction in risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated to adherence; therefore, individuals must strictly adhere to their dosing schedule.  HIV-1 negative status must be confirmed prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP and at least every 3 months thereafter. Delay initiating TRUVADA for PrEP for at least one month until negative HIV-1 status is reconfirmed if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present and if recent exposure is reported (< 1 month). Alternatively, confirm negative HIV status with a test approved by the FDA to aid diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION
TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are infected with HBV and discontinue TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.
TRUVADA when used for a PrEP indication must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and periodically (at least every 3 months) during use.  Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of TRUVADA for PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate TRUVADA for PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed.

About 



                                                Tybost® (cobicistat 150 mg) is a CYP3A inhibitor indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir once daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
                                            


Limitations of use:
Tybost is not interchangeable with ritonavir. Do not use Tybost with other protease inhibitors or darunavir 600 mg twice daily. Tybost and ritonavir may result in different drug interactions when used with concomitant medications.
Contraindictions:
Coadministration: Do not use with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. Do not use with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A as this may lead to a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir or darunavir and development of resistance. 
Use with the following drugs is contraindicated: alfuzosin, dronedarone, rifampin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, pimozide, sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension, triazolam, oral midazolam, and St. John’s wort. When coadminstered with atazanavir, irinotecan, nevirapine, and indinavir are also contraindicated.

Viread is also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection: 

Viread should not be used in combination with Atripla®, Complera®, Stribild®, or Truvada®

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HBV infection:

The indication in adults is based primarily on data from treatment of subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve and a smaller number of subjects who had previously received lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Subjects were adults with HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease
Viread was evaluated in a limited number of subjects with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease
The numbers of subjects in clinical trials who had adefovir-associated substitutions at baseline were too small to reach conclusions of efficacy

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

About 



                                                Epclusa® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with ribavirin for those with decompensated cirrhosis.            
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS

If EPCLUSA is used in combination with ribavirin (RBV), all contraindications, warnings and precautions, and adverse reactions to RBV also apply. Refer to RBV prescribing information.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:

Risk of Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Sofosbuvir Is Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral: Amiodarone is not recommended for use with EPCLUSA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia.
Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of EPCLUSA with P-gp Inducers and/or Moderate to Potent Inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4: Rifampin, St. John’s wort, and carbamazepine are not recommended for use with EPCLUSA as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.

WARNING: 
RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with EPCLUSA . HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.

                                                Hepsera®(adefovir dipivoxil) is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in patients 12 years of age and older with evidence of active viral replication and either evidence of persistent elevations in serum aminotransferases (ALT or AST) or histologically active disease.
                                            

This indication is based on histological, virological, biochemical, and serological responses in adult patients with HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver function, and with clinical evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus with either compensated or decompensated liver function.
For patients 12 to <18 years of age, the indication is based on virological and biochemical responses in patients with HBeAg+ chronic hepatitis B virus infection with compensated liver function.
BOXED WARNING:
SEVERE ACUTE EXACERBATIONS OF HEPATITIS, NEPHROTOXICITY, HIV RESISTANCE, LACTIC ACIDOSIS AND SEVERE HEPATOMEGALY WITH STEATOSIS
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in patients who have discontinued anti-Hepatitis B therapy including Hepsera. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-Hepatitis B therapy. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.
In patients at risk of or having underlying renal dysfunction, chronic administration of Hepsera may result in nephrotoxicity. These patients should be monitored closely for renal function and may require dose adjustment.
HIV resistance may emerge in chronic hepatitis B patients with unrecognized or untreated Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection treated with anti-hepatitis B therapies, such as therapy with Hepsera, that may have activity against HIV.
Lactic acidosis and severe hepatomegaly with steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside analogues alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals.

About Chronic Hepatitis B
Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).  While some people naturally clear HBV infection, many go on to develop chronic (long-term) infection.  Chronic HBV may not show symptoms for many years but over time can lead to life-threatening liver damage, including liver cirrhosis (scarring) and liver cancer.

About 



                                                Sovaldi®(sofosbuvir) is indicated for the treatment of genotype 1, 2, 3 or 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen.
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Contraindications to peginterferon alfa and ribavirin also apply to SOVALDI combination treatment. Refer to the prescribing information of peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for a list of their contraindications.


WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:

Risk of Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA): Amiodarone is not recommended for use with SOVALDI in combination with another DAA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia. 
Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect of SOVALDI Due to Use with P-gp Inducers:Rifampin and St. John's wort are not recommended for use with SOVALDI as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir plasma concentrations. 
Risk Associated with Combination Treatment: Because SOVALDI is used in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of HCV infection, consult the Prescribing Information for these drugs. 
Related Products Not Recommended:SOVALDI is not recommended for use with other products containing sofosbuvir. 

ADVERSE REACTIONS:
Most common (≥20%, all grades) adverse reactions for: 

SOVALDI + peginterferon alfa + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue, headache, nausea, insomnia, and anemia 

SOVALDI + ribavirin combination therapy were fatigue and headache 

WARNING: 
RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with SOVALDI. HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection:

Viread should not be used in combination with Atripla®, Complera®, Stribild®, or Truvada® 

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HBV infection:

The indication in adults is based primarily on data from treatment of subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve and a smaller number of subjects who had previously received lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Subjects were adults with HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease
Viread was evaluated in a limited number of subjects with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease
The numbers of subjects in clinical trials who had adefovir-associated substitutions at baseline were too small to reach conclusions of efficacy 

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

                                                Letairis® is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening; and in combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (60 percent) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (34 percent).
                                            

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY
 
Do not administer Letairis to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm.  Letairis is very likely to produce serious birth defects if used by pregnant females, as this effect has been seen consistently when it is administered to animals.
 
Exclude pregnancy before the initiation of treatment with Letairis.  Females of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with Letairis and for one month after treatment.  Obtain monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment.
 
Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity birth defects, females can only receive Letairis through a restricted program called the Letairis REMS program.

About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious cardiovascular disease that can lead to breathing difficulties and ultimately heart failure.  PAH refers to a narrowing of the vessels that carry blood between the lungs and heart; this narrowing increases blood pressure in the lungs and makes the heart work harder.  In many cases the underlying cause of PAH is unknown.

About 



                                                Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection is a pharmacologic stress agent indicated for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress.
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Do not administer Lexiscan to patients with second- or third-degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction unless these patients have a functioning artificial pacemaker.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Fatal cardiac arrest, life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction may result from the ischemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering Lexiscan. If serious reactions to Lexiscan occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by Lexiscan.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of Lexiscan administration; transient second degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving Lexiscan. In postmarketing experience, third degree heart block and asystole within minutes of Lexiscan administration have occurred.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 min of Lexiscan administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In postmarketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed.
Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of Lexiscan administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise. For patients with known or suspected bronchoconstrictive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to Lexiscan administration.
The incidence of bronchoconstriction (FEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline) was assessed in two clinical studies. In a randomized, controlled study of 49 patients with moderate to severe COPD, the rate of bronchoconstriction was 12% and 6%, for the Lexiscan and placebo groups, respectively. In a randomized, controlled study of 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma who had previously been shown to have bronchoconstrictive reactions to adenosine monophosphate, the rate of bronchoconstriction was the same (4%) for both the Lexiscan and placebo groups. In both studies, dyspnea was reported as an adverse reaction in the Lexiscan group (61% for patients with COPD; 34% for patients with asthma) while no subjects in the placebo group experienced dyspnea.

About Radionuclide Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (RMPI) is a medical technique for diagnosing coronary artery disease, the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.
RMPI involves injecting a small amount of radioactive liquid, or tracer, into the bloodstream.  As the tracer moves through blood vessels and the heart, a camera captures information about blood flow.  This helps doctors assess the extent of any blockage and determine appropriate treatment options.

About Chronic Angina
Coronary artery disease – the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances – is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.   The most common symptom of the disease is chronic angina, recurring chest pain or discomfort due to restricted blood flow to muscles that power the heart. The severe discomfort of angina can prevent people from engaging in everyday activities such as walking and running.

About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. The mucus traps bacteria and increases susceptibility to serious respiratory infections (in addition to its effect on the lungs, CF also affects other bodily systems, e.g., causes high levels of mucus in the digestive tract, leading to digestion problems). Many people with CF are diagnosed as children and may experience life-threatening complications as they reach adulthood. The goal of CF treatment, which may include medication, is to reduce CF symptoms, infection and slow lung damage.

About 



                                                Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) is an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infection in patients 1 year and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days.  Tamiflu is also indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older.
                                            

The following points should be considered before initiating treatment or prophylaxis with Tamiflu:

Efficacy of Tamiflu in patients who begin treatment after 48 hours of symptoms has not been established.
Tamiflu is not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
There is no evidence for efficacy of Tamiflu in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses Types A and B.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance mutations could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use Tamiflu.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Tamiflu is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any component of the product. Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with Tamiflu. Tamiflu should be stopped and appropriate treatment instituted if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected.
Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms which can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease.
There have been postmarketing reports (mostly from Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on Tamiflu usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of Tamiflu to these events has not been established. Closely monitor patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment for each patient.
Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Tamiflu has not been shown to prevent such complications.
Efficacy of Tamiflu in the treatment of influenza in patients with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory disease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population. No information is available regarding treatment of influenza in patients with any medical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring hospitalization.
Efficacy of Tamiflu for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

About Influenza 
Influenza, or the flu, is a common respiratory disease caused by infection with one of multiple influenza viruses.  Influenza takes different forms:  So-called seasonal, or annual, influenza occurs regionally during cold months and pandemic influenza occurs less frequently but can affect the entire globe.
Many people with influenza recover after a period of a few days.  However, influenza can be significantly more serious, as well as life threatening, in some people or when caused by particular viral strains.  In certain cases, antiviral medication is an appropriate option for treating influenza or for preventing those exposed to an influenza virus from becoming sick.  Vaccination is also available to prevent many forms of influenza.

                                                AmBisome® (amphotericin B) liposome for injection is indicated for empirical therapy for presumed fungal infection in febrile, neutropenic patients; treatment of Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV infected patients; treatment of patients with Aspergillus species, Candida species and/or Cryptococcus species infections refractory to amphotericin B deoxycholate, or in patients where renal impairment or unacceptable toxicity precludes the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate; or the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis. In immunocompromised patients with visceral leishmaniasis treated with AmBisome, relapse rates were high following initial clearance of parasites. 
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
AmBisome is contraindicated in those patients who have demonstrated or have known hypersensitivity to amphotericin B deoxycholate or any other constituents of the product unless, in the opinion of the treating physician, the benefit of therapy outweighs the risk.
WARNINGS:
Anaphylaxis has been reported with amphotericin B deoxycholate and other amphotericin B-containing drugs, including AmBisome. If a severe anaphylactic reaction occurs, the infusion should be immediately discontinued and the patient should not receive further infusions of AmBisome.

About Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Neovascular (or “wet”) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that makes reading and seeing details difficult.  It results from abnormal blood vessels that grow underneath a part of the retina (the tissue lining the eye) that are fragile and leak.  AMD is most common in people over age 60, and the cause is not understood.

About HIV/AIDS
Infection with HIV-1, or human immunodeficiency virus, is one of the world’s greatest health challenges, currently affecting more than 35 million people worldwide. HIV progressively damages the immune system, weakening the body’s ability to fight life-threatening infections, which can lead to AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.

                                                Complera® (emtricitabine 200 mg/rilpivirine 25 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated for use as a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 12 years of age and older with no antiretroviral treatment history and with HIV-1 RNA ≤ 100,000 copies/mL at the start of therapy, and in certain virologically-suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) adult patients on a stable antiretroviral regimen at start of therapy in order to replace their current antiretroviral treatment regimen.
                                            


Prescribing considerations in adults with no ARV treatment history:
Virologic failure (HIV-1 RNA ≥50 copies/mL) was higher in subjects with baseline HIV-1 RNA >100,000 copies/mL and in subjects with baseline CD4 cell count <200 cells/mm3 (regardless of baseline HIV-1 RNA levels). Compared to efavirenz, virologic failure in rilpivirine-treated subjects conferred a higher rate of overall resistance and cross-resistance to the NNRTI class and more subjects developed tenofovir and lamivudine/emtricitabine associated resistance.
Prescribing considerations in virologically suppressed adults:
Patients must have no history of virologic failure, be stably suppressed (HIV-1 RNA <50 copies/mL) for ≥6 months prior to switching therapy, currently be on their first or second ARV regimen prior to switching therapy, and have no current or past history of resistance to any component of Complera.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B

Complera is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of Complera have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued products containing emtricitabine and/or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, which are components of Complera. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are coinfected with HIV-1 and HBV and discontinue Complera. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

                                                Truvada® (emtricitabine 200 mg/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients weighing at least 35 kg. Truvada is also indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults at high risk. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Truvada:

Prescribing considerations when initiating TRUVADA for treatment of HIV-1 infection:
Do not use TRUVADA as a component of a triple nucleoside regimen or coadminister with other products containing emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or lamivudine. Use of TRUVADA in treatment experienced HIV-1 infected patients should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history.
Prescribing Considerations before initiating TRUVADA for PrEP:
TRUVADA for PrEP must only be prescribed as part of a comprehensive prevention strategy because TRUVADA is not always effective in preventing the acquisition of HIV-1 infection. Reduction in risk of acquiring HIV-1 is strongly correlated to adherence; therefore, individuals must strictly adhere to their dosing schedule.  HIV-1 negative status must be confirmed prior to initiating TRUVADA for PrEP and at least every 3 months thereafter. Delay initiating TRUVADA for PrEP for at least one month until negative HIV-1 status is reconfirmed if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present and if recent exposure is reported (< 1 month). Alternatively, confirm negative HIV status with a test approved by the FDA to aid diagnosis of acute or primary HIV-1 infection.

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT ACUTE EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B and RISK OF DRUG RESISTANCE WITH USE OF TRUVADA FOR PRE-EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS (PrEP) IN UNDIAGNOSED EARLY HIV-1 INFECTION
TRUVADA is not approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of TRUVADA have not been established in patients coinfected with HBV and HIV-1. Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B have been reported in patients who are coinfected with HBV and HIV-1 and have discontinued TRUVADA. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who are infected with HBV and discontinue TRUVADA. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.
TRUVADA when used for a PrEP indication must only be prescribed to individuals confirmed to be HIV-negative immediately prior to initiating and periodically (at least every 3 months) during use.  Drug-resistant HIV-1 variants have been identified with use of TRUVADA for PrEP following undetected acute HIV-1 infection. Do not initiate TRUVADA for PrEP if signs or symptoms of acute HIV-1 infection are present unless negative infection status is confirmed.

About 



                                                Tybost® (cobicistat 150 mg) is a CYP3A inhibitor indicated to increase systemic exposure of atazanavir or darunavir once daily in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. 
                                            


Limitations of use:
Tybost is not interchangeable with ritonavir. Do not use Tybost with other protease inhibitors or darunavir 600 mg twice daily. Tybost and ritonavir may result in different drug interactions when used with concomitant medications.
Contraindictions:
Coadministration: Do not use with drugs highly dependent on CYP3A for clearance and for which elevated plasma concentrations are associated with serious and/or life-threatening events. Do not use with drugs that strongly induce CYP3A as this may lead to a loss of therapeutic effect of atazanavir or darunavir and development of resistance. 
Use with the following drugs is contraindicated: alfuzosin, dronedarone, rifampin, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine, methylergonovine, cisapride, lovastatin, simvastatin, pimozide, sildenafil for pulmonary arterial hypertension, triazolam, oral midazolam, and St. John’s wort. When coadminstered with atazanavir, irinotecan, nevirapine, and indinavir are also contraindicated.

                                                Viread® (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients 2 years of age and older. Viread is also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. 
                                            

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HIV-1 infection: 

Viread should not be used in combination with Atripla®, Complera®, Stribild®, or Truvada®

The following points should be considered when initiating therapy with Viread for the treatment of HBV infection:

The indication in adults is based primarily on data from treatment of subjects who were nucleoside-treatment-naïve and a smaller number of subjects who had previously received lamivudine or adefovir dipivoxil. Subjects were adults with HBeAg+ and HBeAg- chronic hepatitis B with compensated liver disease
Viread was evaluated in a limited number of subjects with chronic hepatitis B and decompensated liver disease
The numbers of subjects in clinical trials who had adefovir-associated substitutions at baseline were too small to reach conclusions of efficacy

BOXED WARNING:
POST TREATMENT EXACERBATION OF HEPATITIS B
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis have been reported in HBV-infected patients who have discontinued anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. Hepatic function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue anti-hepatitis B therapy, including VIREAD. If appropriate, resumption of anti-hepatitis B therapy may be warranted.

About 



                                                Epclusa® is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis and in combination with ribavirin for those with decompensated cirrhosis.            
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS

If EPCLUSA is used in combination with ribavirin (RBV), all contraindications, warnings and precautions, and adverse reactions to RBV also apply. Refer to RBV prescribing information.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:

Risk of Serious Symptomatic Bradycardia When Sofosbuvir Is Coadministered with Amiodarone and Another HCV Direct Acting Antiviral: Amiodarone is not recommended for use with EPCLUSA due to the risk of symptomatic bradycardia, particularly in patients also taking beta blockers or with underlying cardiac comorbidities and/or with advanced liver disease. In patients without alternative, viable treatment options, cardiac monitoring is recommended. Patients should seek immediate medical evaluation if they develop signs or symptoms of bradycardia.
Risk of Reduced Therapeutic Effect Due to Concomitant Use of EPCLUSA with P-gp Inducers and/or Moderate to Potent Inducers of CYP2B6, CYP2C8 or CYP3A4: Rifampin, St. John’s wort, and carbamazepine are not recommended for use with EPCLUSA as they may significantly decrease sofosbuvir and/or velpatasvir plasma concentrations.

WARNING: 
RISK OF HEPATITIS B VIRUS REACTIVATION IN PATIENTS COINFECTED WITH HCV AND HBV
Test all patients for evidence of current or prior hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection before initiating treatment with EPCLUSA . HBV reactivation has been reported in HCV/HBV coinfected patients who were undergoing or had completed treatment with HCV direct acting antivirals and were not receiving HBV antiviral therapy. Some cases have resulted in fulminant hepatitis, hepatic failure, and death. Monitor HCV/HBV coinfected patients for hepatitis flare or HBV reactivation during HCV treatment and post-treatment follow-up. Initiate appropriate patient management for HBV infection as clinically indicated.

About Chronic Hepatitis B
Chronic hepatitis B is a liver disease caused by infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).  While some people naturally clear HBV infection, many go on to develop chronic (long-term) infection.  Chronic HBV may not show symptoms for many years but over time can lead to life-threatening liver damage, including liver cirrhosis (scarring) and liver cancer.

                                                Letairis® is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (WHO Group 1) to improve exercise ability and delay clinical worsening; and in combination with tadalafil to reduce the risks of disease progression and hospitalization for worsening PAH, and to improve exercise ability. Studies establishing effectiveness included predominantly patients with WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms and etiologies of idiopathic or heritable PAH (60 percent) or PAH associated with connective tissue diseases (34 percent).
                                            

WARNING: EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY
 
Do not administer Letairis to a pregnant female because it may cause fetal harm.  Letairis is very likely to produce serious birth defects if used by pregnant females, as this effect has been seen consistently when it is administered to animals.
 
Exclude pregnancy before the initiation of treatment with Letairis.  Females of reproductive potential must use acceptable methods of contraception during treatment with Letairis and for one month after treatment.  Obtain monthly pregnancy tests during treatment and 1 month after discontinuation of treatment.
 
Because of the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity birth defects, females can only receive Letairis through a restricted program called the Letairis REMS program.

About Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a serious cardiovascular disease that can lead to breathing difficulties and ultimately heart failure.  PAH refers to a narrowing of the vessels that carry blood between the lungs and heart; this narrowing increases blood pressure in the lungs and makes the heart work harder.  In many cases the underlying cause of PAH is unknown.

About 



                                                Lexiscan® (regadenoson) injection is a pharmacologic stress agent indicated for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in patients unable to undergo adequate exercise stress.
                                            

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Do not administer Lexiscan to patients with second- or third-degree AV block or sinus node dysfunction unless these patients have a functioning artificial pacemaker.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Fatal cardiac arrest, life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, and myocardial infarction may result from the ischemia induced by pharmacologic stress agents. Cardiac resuscitation equipment and trained staff should be available before administering Lexiscan. If serious reactions to Lexiscan occur, consider the use of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, to shorten the duration of increased coronary blood flow induced by Lexiscan.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, can depress the SA and AV nodes and may cause first-, second or third-degree AV block, or sinus bradycardia requiring intervention. In clinical trials first degree AV block (PR prolongation > 220 msec) developed in 3% of patients within 2 hours of Lexiscan administration; transient second degree AV block with one dropped beat was observed in one patient receiving Lexiscan. In postmarketing experience, third degree heart block and asystole within minutes of Lexiscan administration have occurred.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, induce arterial vasodilation and hypotension. In clinical trials, decreased systolic blood pressure (> 35 mm Hg) was observed in 7% of patients and decreased diastolic blood pressure (> 25 mm Hg) was observed in 4% of patients within 45 min of Lexiscan administration. The risk of serious hypotension may be higher in patients with autonomic dysfunction, hypovolemia, left main coronary artery stenosis, stenotic valvular heart disease, pericarditis or pericardial effusions, or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. In postmarketing experience, syncope, transient ischemic attacks and seizures have been observed.
Administration of adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may result in clinically significant increases in blood pressure in some patients. Among patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure in clinical trials, the increase was observed within minutes of Lexiscan administration. Most increases resolved within 10 to 15 minutes, but in some cases, increases were observed at 45 minutes following administration. In post-marketing experience, cases of potentially clinically significant hypertension have been reported, particularly with underlying hypertension and when low-level exercise was included in the MPI.
Adenosine receptor agonists, including Lexiscan, may cause bronchoconstriction and respiratory compromise. For patients with known or suspected bronchoconstrictive disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, appropriate bronchodilator therapy and resuscitative measures should be available prior to Lexiscan administration.
The incidence of bronchoconstriction (FEV1 reduction > 15% from baseline) was assessed in two clinical studies. In a randomized, controlled study of 49 patients with moderate to severe COPD, the rate of bronchoconstriction was 12% and 6%, for the Lexiscan and placebo groups, respectively. In a randomized, controlled study of 48 patients with mild to moderate asthma who had previously been shown to have bronchoconstrictive reactions to adenosine monophosphate, the rate of bronchoconstriction was the same (4%) for both the Lexiscan and placebo groups. In both studies, dyspnea was reported as an adverse reaction in the Lexiscan group (61% for patients with COPD; 34% for patients with asthma) while no subjects in the placebo group experienced dyspnea.

About Radionuclide Myocardial Perfusion Imaging
Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (RMPI) is a medical technique for diagnosing coronary artery disease, the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances. Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.
RMPI involves injecting a small amount of radioactive liquid, or tracer, into the bloodstream.  As the tracer moves through blood vessels and the heart, a camera captures information about blood flow.  This helps doctors assess the extent of any blockage and determine appropriate treatment options.

About Chronic Angina
Coronary artery disease – the narrowing or blockage of blood vessels by the build-up of cholesterol or other fatty substances – is a leading cause of death in the United States and globally.   The most common symptom of the disease is chronic angina, recurring chest pain or discomfort due to restricted blood flow to muscles that power the heart. The severe discomfort of angina can prevent people from engaging in everyday activities such as walking and running.

About Cystic Fibrosis
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of mucus in the lungs. The mucus traps bacteria and increases susceptibility to serious respiratory infections (in addition to its effect on the lungs, CF also affects other bodily systems, e.g., causes high levels of mucus in the digestive tract, leading to digestion problems). Many people with CF are diagnosed as children and may experience life-threatening complications as they reach adulthood. The goal of CF treatment, which may include medication, is to reduce CF symptoms, infection and slow lung damage.

oseltamivir phosphate 75 mg

About 



                                                Tamiflu® (oseltamivir phosphate) is an influenza neuraminidase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated acute illness due to influenza infection in patients 1 year and older who have been symptomatic for no more than 2 days.  Tamiflu is also indicated for the prophylaxis of influenza in patients 1 year and older.
                                            

The following points should be considered before initiating treatment or prophylaxis with Tamiflu:

Efficacy of Tamiflu in patients who begin treatment after 48 hours of symptoms has not been established.
Tamiflu is not a substitute for early influenza vaccination on an annual basis as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
There is no evidence for efficacy of Tamiflu in any illness caused by agents other than influenza viruses Types A and B.
Influenza viruses change over time. Emergence of resistance mutations could decrease drug effectiveness. Other factors (for example, changes in viral virulence) might also diminish clinical benefit of antiviral drugs. Prescribers should consider available information on influenza drug susceptibility patterns and treatment effects when deciding whether to use Tamiflu.

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
Tamiflu is contraindicated in patients with known serious hypersensitivity to oseltamivir or any component of the product. Severe allergic reactions have included anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
Cases of anaphylaxis and serious skin reactions including toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and erythema multiforme have been reported in postmarketing experience with Tamiflu. Tamiflu should be stopped and appropriate treatment instituted if an allergic-like reaction occurs or is suspected.
Influenza can be associated with a variety of neurologic and behavioral symptoms which can include events such as hallucinations, delirium, and abnormal behavior, in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes. These events may occur in the setting of encephalitis or encephalopathy but can occur without obvious severe disease.
There have been postmarketing reports (mostly from Japan) of delirium and abnormal behavior leading to injury, and in some cases resulting in fatal outcomes, in patients with influenza who were receiving Tamiflu. Because these events were reported voluntarily during clinical practice, estimates of frequency cannot be made but they appear to be uncommon based on Tamiflu usage data. These events were reported primarily among pediatric patients and often had an abrupt onset and rapid resolution. The contribution of Tamiflu to these events has not been established. Closely monitor patients with influenza for signs of abnormal behavior. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment for each patient.
Serious bacterial infections may begin with influenza-like symptoms or may coexist with or occur as complications during the course of influenza. Tamiflu has not been shown to prevent such complications.
Efficacy of Tamiflu in the treatment of influenza in patients with chronic cardiac disease and/or respiratory disease has not been established. No difference in the incidence of complications was observed between the treatment and placebo groups in this population. No information is available regarding treatment of influenza in patients with any medical condition sufficiently severe or unstable to be considered at imminent risk of requiring hospitalization.
Efficacy of Tamiflu for treatment or prophylaxis of influenza has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

About Influenza 
Influenza, or the flu, is a common respiratory disease caused by infection with one of multiple influenza viruses.  Influenza takes different forms:  So-called seasonal, or annual, influenza occurs regionally during cold months and pandemic influenza occurs less frequently but can affect the entire globe.
Many people with influenza recover after a period of a few days.  However, influenza can be significantly more serious, as well as life threatening, in some people or when caused by particular viral strains.  In certain cases, antiviral medication is an appropriate option for treating influenza or for preventing those exposed to an influenza virus from becoming sick.  Vaccination is also available to prevent many forms of influenza.

About Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration 
Neovascular (or “wet”) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease that makes reading and seeing details difficult.  It results from abnormal blood vessels that grow underneath a part of the retina (the tissue lining the eye) that are fragile and leak.  AMD is most common in people over age 60, and the cause is not understood.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Gilead Sciences Expects a Fall in Its HCV Product Sales in 2017


By Margaret Patrick

				Feb 22, 2017				11:40 am EDT            










Fall in HCV product sales
Gilead Sciences (GILD) has projected its 2017 hepatitis C (or HCV) net product sales to be in the range of $7.5 billion–$9.0 billion, a significant fall from its $14.8 billion in HCV product sales in 2016.
The projected revenue fall can mainly be attributed to fewer new patients’ being expected to initiate Gilead Sciences’ HCV therapy in 2017.

The above diagram shows the various factors that are expected to affect Gilead Sciences’ 2017 HCV product sales. The company has recently been facing stiff competition from other HCV players such as AbbVie (ABBV), Merck & Co. (MRK), and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).



Fewer new patient starts
In 2015, Gilead Sciences witnessed 256,000 new patient starts in its HCV franchise in the US market. This number fell to 231,000 new patient starts in 2016. Gilead witnessed a one-time rise of ~20,000 new patients due to new access from two commercial payers and new patients treated under the Veterans Access (or VA) program in 2016. The launch of Epclusa in the US market in June 2016 also allowed for the treatment of warehoused genotype 2 and genotype 3 patients in 2016.
In absence of these factors, in 2017, Gilead Sciences expects to witness further falls in its new HCV patient starts in the United States to anywhere in the range of 150,000–175,000. Gilead also expects a fall in new HCV patient starts from ~105,000 in 2016 to ~75,000–85,000 in 2017 in the European Union Five (or EU5). The EU5 comprises the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain.
Gilead has also projected a fall in new HCV patient starts in the Japanese market from ~88,000 in 2016 to ~30,000–40,000 in 2017.
If new patient starts in 2017 are lower than anticipated, Gilead Sciences’ share price could see the negative effects, as could the price of the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI). GILD makes up ~0.37% of VTI’s total portfolio holdings.

Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD) Gets European Approval for HCV Treatment Vosevi
 
 Corey Williams-July 28, 2017, 8:11 AM EDT

SHARE ON:





 


 



Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) announced that the European Commission has granted marketing authorization for Vosevi® (sofosbuvir 400mg/velpatasvir 100mg/voxilaprevir 100mg), as a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. 
Vosevi was authorized as a 12-week treatment regimen for patients with any genotype of chronic HCV infection, without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, who have previously failed therapy with a direct-acting antiviral (DAA)-containing regimen. A 12-week regimen was also authorized for use in DAA-naïve patients with compensated cirrhosis infected with any HCV genotype, with an option to shorten therapy to 8 weeks for those infected with genotype 3. For DAA-naïve patients without cirrhosis, the recommended treatment duration is 8 weeks. 
“DAA-based therapies have transformed our ability to treat hepatitis C. However, until now we have had limited options for patients who have failed to achieve cure with these regimens,” said Professor Michael Manns, Director of the Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. “Vosevi has demonstrated high cure rates across a range of DAA-experienced patients, with a simple 12-week single tablet regimen. Availability of Vosevi will have a significant impact for this group of patients, offering them the opportunity to be cured of this disease.” 
Gilead also today announced an extension of the marketing authorization for Harvoni® (ledipasvir 90mg/sofosbuvir 400mg). Previously authorized for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV genotype 1, 3, 4, 5 or 6 infection, the indication for Harvoni has been extended to include the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 infection in adolescents aged 12 to < 18 years. Harvoni is the first direct-acting antiviral regimen to receive marketing authorization in the European Union extended for use in the adolescent population. 
“The authorization of Vosevi and the extended indication for Harvoni demonstrate our ongoing commitment to bring therapies with high cure rates to all HCV-infected patients,” said John Milligan, PhD, Gilead’s President and Chief Executive Officer. “We look forward to working with healthcare providers and governments to ensure Vosevi is made available to patients who would benefit the most from it, while continuing to expand the benefits of our other approved medicines for patients with chronic HCV infection across Europe.” 
Sofosbuvir-based regimens are recommended by global guidelines across HCV genotypes and disease severities and have been used to treat more than 1.5 million patients worldwide. Vosevi is Gilead’s fourth sofosbuvir-based treatment to be granted marketing authorization by the European Commission for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. The marketing authorization of Vosevi follows an accelerated review procedure by the European Medicines Agency, reserved for medicinal products expected to be of major public health interest. It allows for the marketing of Vosevi in all 28 countries of the European Union. Gilead will now work diligently with national pricing and reimbursement agencies across Europe to make Vosevi available to patients. 
The approval of Vosevi is supported by data from four Phase 3 studies. Two studies (POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4) evaluated 12 weeks of the single tablet regimen in patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1-6 previously treated unsuccessfully with DAA-containing regimens, including NS5A inhibitors. Two other studies (POLARIS-2 and POLARIS-3) evaluated 8 weeks of Vosevi in DAA-naïve patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1-6. Across POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4, 97 percent of patients treated with Vosevi (n=431/445) achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of SVR12. In POLARIS-2, 95 percent of patients with hepatitis C genotypes 1-6 with and without cirrhosis treated with Vosevi (n=477/501) achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of SVR12. In POLARIS-3, 96 percent of patients with genotype 3 infection and compensated cirrhosis treated with Vosevi (n=106/110) achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of SVR12. The most common adverse drug reactions among patients who received Vosevi in the POLARIS studies were headache, diarrhea and nausea. 
Sofosbuvir as a single agent was granted marketing authorization in the European Union on January 16, 2014, under the trade name Sovaldi®, for use in combination with other agents for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection. The single tablet regimen, Harvoni, received marketing authorization in the European Union on November 18, 2014. The single tablet regimen of sofosbuvir (400mg) and velpatasvir (100mg) received marketing authorization in the European Union on July 8, 2016, under the trade name Epclusa® for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection. 
Vosevi was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on July 18, 2017 for the re-treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection.

Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies which were developing drugs to treat patients with pulmonary diseases. The company currently produces a range of commercially available products, most notably the Hepatitis C drugs: Harvoni and Sovaldi.[4]
Headquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. As of the end of 2015, the company had approximately 7,900 full-time employees.[5][6] Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.
The company's name and logo refer to the Balm of Gilead, inspired by a 1965 play by Lanford Wilson featuring the underworld adventures of the patrons of the namesake cafe.

 Gregg Alton of Gilead Sciences & others, "The Evolution of HIV/AIDS Therapies: A Conversation", 2012, Chemical Heritage Foundation


Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.[7][8][9] Riordan graduated from Washington University, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School.[10][11][12] Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.[13] Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman.[9] Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.[14]
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines.[15][16] Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.[17] Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.[18]
1990-1999: IPO[edit]
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.
In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.
In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,[19] but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.
In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.
2000-2009: Growth through acquisition[edit]
In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada.[20] The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.
In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,[21] also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.
In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.[22][23] Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.[24] Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then it's largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.
Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.[25]
In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.[26] Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes.
Present decade[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.[27]
In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.[28] Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).
On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.[29]
In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.
In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:

It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[30]
It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.[31]
It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.[32]

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.[33][34]
Sovaldi and Harvoni[edit]
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. Forbes magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.[35] Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,[36] and Barron's noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.[37]
On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.[38] The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.[39] For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.[40]
Merck & Co. combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir and marketed the treatment as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).[41] By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.[42]
Prospects for the future[edit]
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.[43] Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.[44] Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.[45]

Gilead Sciences is an American biopharmaceutical company that discovers, develops and commercializes therapeutics. For many years since the company was founded, the company concentrated primarily on antiviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and influenza. In 2006, Gilead acquired two companies which were developing drugs to treat patients with pulmonary diseases. The company currently produces a range of commercially available products, most notably the Hepatitis C drugs: Harvoni and Sovaldi.[4]
Headquartered and founded in Foster City, California, Gilead has operations in North America, Europe and Australia. As of the end of 2015, the company had approximately 7,900 full-time employees.[5][6] Gilead is a member of the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and the S&P 500.
The company's name and logo refer to the Balm of Gilead, inspired by a 1965 play by Lanford Wilson featuring the underworld adventures of the patrons of the namesake cafe.

 Gregg Alton of Gilead Sciences & others, "The Evolution of HIV/AIDS Therapies: A Conversation", 2012, Chemical Heritage Foundation


Gilead Sciences was founded in June 1987 by Michael L. Riordan, a medical doctor who was 29 years old at the time.[7][8][9] Riordan graduated from Washington University, the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the Harvard Business School.[10][11][12] Three core scientific advisers worked with Riordan to create the company and establish its scientific vision. These were Peter Dervan of Caltech, Doug Melton of Harvard, and Harold Weintraub of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Riordan served as CEO from inception until 1996.[13] Menlo Ventures, a venture capital firm where Riordan worked for a year, made the first investment in Gilead, of $2 million, and Menlo's partner DuBose Montgomery served as Chairman of the Board until 1993, when Riordan became Chairman.[9] Riordan also recruited as scientific advisers Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who later became Director of the National Institutes of Health, and Jack Szostak, recipient of the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2009.[14]
The company's primary therapeutic focus was, and continues to be, in antiviral medicines, a field that interested Riordan because he contracted dengue fever, an untreatable viral disease, while working in malnutrition clinics as a Henry Luce Scholar in the Philippines.[15][16] Riordan recruited Donald Rumsfeld to join the board of directors in 1988, followed by Benno C. Schmidt, Sr., Gordon Moore, and George P. Shultz. Riordan tried to recruit Warren Buffett as an investor and board member, but was unsuccessful.[17] Under the technical leadership of scientist Dr. Mark Matteucci, the company focused its early discovery research on making small strands of DNA (oligomers) to assess the potential of genetic code blockers (gene therapy). Its development of small molecule antiviral therapeutics began in 1991 when CEO Riordan and R&D head John C. Martin in-licensed a group of nucleotide compounds discovered in two European academic labs; one of the compounds was tenofovir, a pro-drug of which, trade named Viread, became one of the most widely used anti-retroviral drugs.[18]
1990-1999: IPO[edit]
In 1990, Gilead entered into a collaborative research agreement with Glaxo for the research and development of genetic code blockers, also known as antisense. This collaboration was terminated in 1998, and Gilead's antisense intellectual property portfolio was sold to Isis Pharmaceuticals. Gilead debuted on the NASDAQ in January 1992. Its initial public offering raised $86.25 million in proceeds.
In June 1996, Gilead launched Vistide (cidofovir injection) for the treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with AIDS. The company cooperated with Pharmacia & Upjohn to market the product outside the United States.
In January 1997, Donald Rumsfeld, a Board member since 1988, was appointed Chairman,[19] but left the Board in January 2001 when appointed United States Secretary of Defense at the start of George W. Bush's first term as President.
In March 1999, Gilead acquired NeXstar Pharmaceuticals of Boulder, Colorado following two years of negotiations with the company. At the time, NeXstar's annual sales of $130 million was three times Gilead's sales. NeXstar's two revenue-generating drugs were AmBisome, an injectable fungal treatment, and DaunoXome, an oncology drug taken by HIV patients. Also in 1999, Roche announced first approval of Tamiflu (oseltamivir) for the treatment of influenza. Tamiflu was originally discovered by Gilead and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing. Viread (tenofovir) achieved first approval in 2001 for the treatment of HIV.
2000-2009: Growth through acquisition[edit]
In January 2003, Gilead completed its acquisition of Triangle Pharmaceuticals. Triangle owned the development and commercialization rights to emtricitabine, which although marketed as a stand-alone product (Emtriva), is also a component of the more profitable combination products Atripla and Truvada.[20] The company also announced its first full year of profitability. Later that year Hepsera (adefovir) was approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B, and Emtriva (emtricitabine) for the treatment of HIV.
In 2004, Gilead launched Truvada, a fixed-dose combination of tenofovir and emtricitabine.
In November 2005, President George W. Bush urged the United States Congress to pass $7.1 billion in emergency funding to prepare for the possible bird flu pandemic, of which $1 billion is solely dedicated to the purchase, and distribution of Tamiflu.
In 2006, Gilead completed two acquisitions that allowed the company to branch out from its historical antiviral franchise into the cardiovascular and respiratory therapeutic arenas. Under an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline, Myogen marketed Flolan (epoprostenol sodium) in the United States for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, Myogen was developing (in Phase 3 studies) darusentan,[21] also an endothelin receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of resistant hypertension.
In 2006, the company acquired Corus Pharma, Inc. for $365 million. The acquisition of Corus signaled Gilead's entry into the respiratory arena. Corus was developing aztreonam lysine for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who are infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In July 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Atripla, a once a day single tablet regimen for HIV, combining Sustiva (efavirenz), a Bristol-Myers Squibb product, and Truvada (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil), a Gilead product.[22][23] Gilead purchased Raylo Chemicals, Inc. in November 2006 for a price of $133.3 million.[24] Raylo Chemical, based in Edmonton, Alberta, was a wholly owned subsidiary of Degussa AG, a German company. Raylo Chemical was a custom manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries. Later in the same year Gilead acquired Myogen, Inc. for $2.5 billion (then it's largest acquisition). With two drugs in development (ambrisentan and darusentan), and one marketed product (Flolan) for pulmonary diseases, the acquisition of Myogen has solidified Gilead's position in this therapeutic arena.
Gilead expanded its move into respiratory therapeutics in 2007 by entering into a licensing agreement with Parion for an epithelial sodium channel inhibitor for the treatment of pulmonary diseases, including cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis.[25]
In 2009, the company acquired CV Therapeutics, Inc. for $1.4 billion, bringing Ranexa and Lexiscan into Gilead. Ranexa is a cardiovascular drug used to treat chest pain related to coronary artery disease, with both of these products and pipeline building out Gilead's cardiovascular franchise.[26] Later, in the same year the company received the award for one of the Fastest Growing Companies by Fortune. In the same year they were also named as one America's Top Companies to work for by Forbes.
Present decade[edit]
In 2010, the company acquired CGI Pharmaceuticals for $120 million, expanding Gilead's research expertise into kinase biology and chemistry. Later that year, the company acquired Arresto Biosciences, Inc. for $225 million, obtaining developmental-stage research for treating fibrotic diseases and cancer.[27]
In 2011, the company acquired Calistoga Pharmaceuticals for $375 million ($225 million plus milestone payments). The acquisition boosted Gilead's oncology and inflammation areas.[28] Later that year, Gilead made its most important acquisition — and most expensive to date — with the $10.4 billion purchase of Pharmasset, Inc. This transaction helped cement Gilead as the leader in treatment of the hepatitis C virus by giving it control of sofosbuvir (see below).
On July 16, 2012, the FDA approved Gilead's Truvada for prevention of HIV infection (it was already approved for treating HIV). The pill was a preventive measure (PrEP) for people at high risk of getting HIV through sexual activity.[29]
In 2013, the company acquired YM Biosciences, Inc. for $510 million. The acquisition brings drug candidate CYT387, an orally-administered, once-daily, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family, specifically JAK1 and JAK2, into Gilead's oncology pipeline. The JAK enzymes have been implicated in myeloproliferative diseases, inflammatory disorders, and certain cancers.
In 2015, the company made a trio of acquisitions:

It bought Phenex Pharmaceuticals for $470 million. Its Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) program used small-molecule FXR agonists in the treatment of liver diseases such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.[30]
It bought EpiTherapeutics for $65 million. This acquisition gave Gilead first-in-class small molecule inhibitors of histone demethylases involved in regulating gene transcription in cancer.[31]
It paid $425 million for a 15% equity stake in Galapagos NV, with additional payments for Gilead to license the experimental anti-inflammatory drug filgotinib, which may treat rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.[32]

In 2016, the company acquired Nimbus Apollo, Inc. for $400 million, giving Gilead control of the compound NDI-010976 (an ACC inhibitor) and other preclinical ACC inhibitors for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and for the potential treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.[33][34]
Sovaldi and Harvoni[edit]
The drug sofosbuvir had been part of the 2011 acquisition of Pharmasset. In 2013, the FDA approved this drug, under the trade name Sovaldi, as a treatment for the hepatitis C virus. Forbes magazine ranked Gilead its number 4 drug company, citing a market capitalization of US$113 billion and stock appreciation of 100%, and describing their 2011 purchase of Pharmasset for $11 billion as “one of the best pharma acquisitions ever”.[35] Deutsche Bank estimated Sovaldi sales in the year's final quarter would be $53 million,[36] and Barron's noted the FDA approval and subsequent strong sales of the “potentially revolutionary” drug as a positive indicator for the stock.[37]
On July 11, 2014, the United States Senate Committee on Finance investigated Sovaldi's high price ($1,000 per pill; $84,000 for the full 12-week regimen). Senators questioned the extent to which the market was operating “efficiently and rationally”, and committee chairman Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and ranking minority member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) wrote to CEO John C. Martin asking Gilead to justify the price for this drug.[38] The committee hearings did not result in new law, but in 2014 and 2015, due to negotiated and mandated discounts, Sovaldi was sold well below the list price.[39] For poorer countries, Gilead licensed multiple companies to produce generic versions of Sovaldi; in India, a pill's price was as low as $4.29.[40]
Merck & Co. combined Sovaldi with ledipasvir and marketed the treatment as Harvoni. This treatment for hepatitis C cures the patient in 94% to 99% of cases (HCV genotype 1).[41] By 2017, Gilead was reporting drastic drops in Sovaldi revenue from year to year, not only because of pricing pressure but because the number of suitable patients decreased.[42]
Prospects for the future[edit]
As of 2017, Gilead's challenge is to develop or acquire new blockbuster drugs before its current revenue-producers wane or their patent protection expires. Like other pharmaceutical companies, it stands to gain from efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to repeal taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). However, Gilead also benefitted from the expansion of Medicaid in the ACA; Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that Gilead's HIV drugs could face funding pressure under reform proposals.[43] Gilead has $32 billion in cash, but $27.4 billion is outside the U.S. and is unavailable for acquisitions unless Gilead pays U.S. tax on it, though it could borrow against it.[44] Gilead would benefit from proposals to let companies repatriate offshore capital with minimal further taxation.[45]

Gilead Sciences says late-stage results for HIV drug combination are similar to standard of care
Gilead Sciences Inc.  said early Monday that its HIV combination treatment had similar safety and efficacy results in two late-stage clinical trials to the standard of care. The data, along with two other late-stage clinical trials, are the basis of Gilead's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, the company said. The combination of the drugs bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide is intended for patients who are new to treatment. One of the phase 3 studies, which enrolled 629 patients, found that 92.4% of patients on the BIC/FTC/TAF combination treatment achieved the primary endpoint at week 48, compared with 93% of patients achieving the primary endpoint on the other regimen. In the other study, which enrolled 645 patients, 89.4% of those on the BIC/FTC/TAF regimen and 92.9% of those on another regimen achieved the primary endpoint at week 48. In both studies, discontinuations due to adverse events were low, according to Gilead. Two studies looking at the combination in  virologically suppressed adult patients are ongoing and are also part of the company's U.S. and European regulatory submissions, Gilead said. Gilead shares surged 0.7% in pre-market trade before declining 0.2% pre-market. Shares have surged 11.3% over the last three months, compared with a 4.1% rise in the S&P 500 .

UPDATE: Gilead says four late-stage trials of HIV drug combination met primary endpoints
Gilead Sciences Inc.  said pre-market Tuesday that an HIV drug combination met primary endpoints in four late-stage clinical trials. The company said it plans to file for approval in the U.S. and Europe this year. Gilead's combination, the drugs bictegravir and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide, is intended to treat HIV-1 infection in a single tablet regimen, and the latest results "could represent an important advance in triple-therapy treatment for a broad range of HIV patients," Gilead said. Two of the studies looked at the combination's efficacy and safety relative to another HIV drug in newly-diagnosed patients. The other two studies compared patients switching to the Gilead HIV combination to those on another regimen. HIV drugs, along with Hepatitis C drugs, have become an important part of Gilead's revenue stream. Shares were up a scant 0.3% in pre-market trade on Tuesday. Shares have dropped 8.7% over the last three months, compared with a 1.9% rise in the S&P 500 .
