Tarena International, Inc. Launches TMOOC.CN to Offer Online Education Products






Mar 17, 2015, 8:26am EDT















BEIJING, March 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tarena International, Inc. (NASDAQ: TEDU) ("Tarena" or the "Company"), a leading provider of professional education services in China, today announced the launch of TMOOC.CN, Tarena's own online learning platform that will leverage Tarena's thirteen years of experience and expertise in providing high quality professional education services to cover a broader customer base. 
TMOOC.CN will begin by offering two types of online learning products: continuing education courses and job placement training courses. Continuing education courses, composed of a library of video clips that focus on on-the-job practical skills, target working professionals and others with continuing education needs. These courses will allow them to sharpen skills at their own pace based on personal career objectives. Job placement training courses are full length programs that target job seekers. These recruitment-oriented courses are carefully chosen from existing courses at Tarena learning centers and redesigned to be more suitable for online learning environment. Students who finish all modules in a placement training course and pass the relevant Tarena certification examination will receive the same job placement services offered by Tarena as enjoyed by other students at learning centers.
"TMOOC.CN sets an important milestone for Tarena as the platform will extend Tarena's footprint beyond entry-level training to lifelong professional education services that will accompany professionals throughout their career. Continuing education courses will equip working professionals with advanced practical knowledge of real application values to help them advance in their careers," said Shaoyun Han, founder, CEO and chairman of Tarena. "The job placement training courses will be a hybrid model pursuant to which approximately 80% of the study will be completed online and 20% will be spent at existing learning centers in order to better address questions that students may encounter. This hybrid model will greatly enhance students' learning experience and also improve learning centers' utilization. Moreover, we believe that only with Tarena's broad national network of 118 centers in 37 cities, can this hybrid model be efficiently operated. We expect that through TMOOC.CN, our students will not only master the foundational skills necessary to launch their careers, but also continue learning at our platform to strengthen their competitiveness throughout their careers."

BEIJING, March 17, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Tarena International, Inc. (NASDAQ:   TEDU) ("Tarena" or the "Company"), a leading provider of professional education services in China, today announced the launch of TMOOC.CN, Tarena's own online learning platform that will leverage Tarena's thirteen years of experience and expertise in providing high quality professional education services to cover a broader customer base. 
TMOOC.CN will begin by offering two types of online learning products: continuing education courses and job placement training courses. Continuing education courses, composed of a library of video clips that focus on on-the-job practical skills, target working professionals and others with continuing education needs. These courses will allow them to sharpen skills at their own pace based on personal career objectives. Job placement training courses are full length programs that target job seekers. These recruitment-oriented courses are carefully chosen from existing courses at Tarena learning centers and redesigned to be more suitable for online learning environment. Students who finish all modules in a placement training course and pass the relevant Tarena certification examination will receive the same job placement services offered by Tarena as enjoyed by other students at learning centers.
"TMOOC.CN sets an important milestone for Tarena as the platform will extend Tarena's footprint beyond entry-level training to lifelong professional education services that will accompany professionals throughout their career. Continuing education courses will equip working professionals with advanced practical knowledge of real application values to help them advance in their careers," said Shaoyun Han, founder, CEO and chairman of Tarena. "The job placement training courses will be a hybrid model pursuant to which approximately 80% of the study will be completed online and 20% will be spent at existing learning centers in order to better address questions that students may encounter. This hybrid model will greatly enhance students' learning experience and also improve learning centers' utilization. Moreover, we believe that only with Tarena's broad national network of 118 centers in 37 cities, can this hybrid model be efficiently operated. We expect that through TMOOC.CN, our students will not only master the foundational skills necessary to launch their careers, but also continue learning at our platform to strengthen their competitiveness throughout their careers."

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
