Business Formation: LLCs & Corporations
LLCs (Limited Liability Companies)










LLC Basics




Limited liability companies combine the best parts of partnerships and corporations.


By Beth Laurence, J.D.

A limited liability company (LLC) offers protection from personal liability for business debts, just like a corporation. However, unlike a corporation, which must pay its own taxes, an LLC is a pass-through tax entity: The profits and losses of the business pass through to its owners, who report them on their personal tax returns just as they would if they owned a partnership or sole proprietorship. Moreover, while setting up an LLC is more difficult than creating a partnership or sole proprietorship, running one is significantly easier than running a corporation.
Here are the main features of an LLC:
Limited Personal Liability
Like shareholders of a corporation, all LLC owners are protected from personal liability for business debts and claims. This means that if the business itself can't pay a creditor -- such as a supplier, a lender, or a landlord -- the creditor cannot legally come after an LLC member's house, car, or other personal possessions. Because only LLC assets are used to pay off business debts, LLC owners stand to lose only the money that they've invested in the LLC. This feature is often called "limited liability."
Exceptions to Limited Liability
While LLC owners enjoy limited personal liability for many of their business transactions, this protection is not absolute. This drawback is not unique to LLCs, however -- the same exceptions apply to corporations. An LLC owner can be held personally liable if he or she:

personally and directly injures someone
personally guarantees a bank loan or a business debt on which the LLC defaults
fails to deposit taxes withheld from employees' wages
intentionally does something fraudulent, illegal, or reckless that causes harm to the company or to someone else, or
treats the LLC as an extension of his or her personal affairs, rather than as a separate legal entity.

This last exception is the most important. If owners don't treat the LLC as a separate business, a court might decide that the LLC doesn't really exist and find that its owners are really doing business as individuals who are personally liable for their acts. To keep this from happening, make sure you and your co-owners:

Act fairly and legally. Do not conceal or misrepresent material facts or the state of your finances to vendors, creditors, or other outsiders.
Fund your LLC adequately. Invest enough cash in the business so that your LLC can meet foreseeable expenses and liabilities.
Keep LLC and personal business separate. Get a federal employer identification number, open up a business-only checking account, and keep your personal finances out of your LLC accounting books.
Create an operating agreement. Having a formal written operating agreement lends credibility to your LLC's separate existence. For more on this, see Nolo's article The LLC Operating Agreement.

For more information on LLC limited liability protection and the differences in state laws, see  LLCs and Limited  Liability - What Protection Do You Get?.  


Additional Protection: Business Insurance
A good liability insurance policy can shield your personal assets when limited liability protection does not. For instance, if you are a massage therapist and you accidentally injure a client's back, your liability insurance policy should cover you. Insurance can also protect your personal assets in the event that your limited liability status is ignored by a court.
In addition to protecting your personal assets in such situations, insurance can protect the LLC's assets from lawsuits and claims. But your LLC won't be protected if it doesn't pay its bills: Commercial insurance usually does not protect personal or corporate assets from unpaid business debts, whether or not they're personally guaranteed.
For more information on insurance, see Nolo's article Obtaining Small Business Insurance.
LLC Taxes
Unlike a corporation, an LLC is not considered separate from its owners for tax purposes. Instead, it is what the IRS calls a "pass-through entity," like a partnership or sole proprietorship. This means that business income passes through the business to the LLC members, who report their share of profits -- or losses -- on their individual income tax returns. Each LLC member must make quarterly estimated tax payments to the IRS.
While an LLC itself doesn't pay taxes, co-owned LLCs must file Form 1065, an informational return, with the IRS each year. This form, which partnerships also have to file, sets out each LLC member's share of the LLC's profits (or losses), which the IRS reviews to make sure LLC members are correctly reporting their income.
For more information on LLC taxes, see Nolo's article How LLCs Are Taxed.
LLC Management
The owners of most small LLCs participate equally in the management of their business. This arrangement is called "member management."
There is an alternative management structure -- somewhat awkwardly called "manager management" -- in which you designate one or more owners (or even an outsider) to take responsibility for managing the LLC. The nonmanaging owners (sometimes family members who have invested in the company) simply sit back and share in LLC profits.
In a manager-managed LLC, only the named managers get to vote on management decisions and act as agents of the LLC. Choosing manager management sometimes makes sense, but it might require you to deal with state and federal laws regulating the sale of securities. (For more information, see Nolo's Limited Liability Company (LLC) FAQ.)
Forming an LLC
To create an LLC, you file "articles of organization" (in some states called a "certificate of organization" or "certificate of formation") with the LLC division of your state government. This office is often in the same department as the corporations division, which is usually part of the secretary of state's office. Filing fees range from about $100 to $800. Now, in every state, you can  form an LLC with just one person.
Many states supply a blank one-page form for the articles of organization, on which you need only specify a few basic details about your LLC, such as its name and address, and contact information for a person involved with the LLC (usually called a "registered agent") who will receive legal papers on its behalf. Some states also require you to list the names and addresses of the LLC members.
In addition to filing articles of organization, you must create a written LLC operating agreement. You don't have to file your operating agreement with the state, but that doesn't mean you can get by without one. The operating agreement is a crucial document because it sets out the LLC members' rights and responsibilities, their percentage interests in the business, and their share of the profits.
To learn more about these and other details involved in setting up an LLC, read Nolo's article How to Form an LLC. To form your LLC right now, use Nolo's Online LLC, which will collect the required information and file your articles of organization with your state.
Ending an LLC
Under the laws of many states, unless your operating agreement says otherwise, when one member wants to leave the LLC, the company dissolves. In that case, the LLC members must fulfill any remaining business obligations, pay off all debts, divide any assets and profits among themselves, and then decide whether they want to start a new LLC to continue the business with the remaining members.
Your LLC operating agreement can prevent this kind of abrupt ending to your business by including "buy-sell," or buyout, provisions that set up guidelines for what will happen when one member retires, dies, becomes disabled, or leaves the LLC to pursue other interests. (For more information, see Nolo's article Plan Ahead for LLC Ownership Changes.)

How to Form an LLC in Colorado




To form an LLC in Colorado, here's everything you need to know.


By Stephen Fishman, J.D.




Share on Google Plus





Share on Facebook













 





Here are the steps you need to take to form an LLC in Colorado. For more information on how to form an LLC in any state, see Nolo's article How to Form an LLC.
1. Choose a Name for Your LLC
Under Colorado law, an LLC must contain the words or abbreviation “limited liability company,” “ltd. liability company,” “limited liability co.,” “ltd. liability co.,” “limited,” “l.l.c.,” “llc” or “ltd.,”Limited Liability Company," "Limited Company," or the abbreviation "L.L.C.," "L.C.," "LLC," or "LC." The word "Limited" may be abbreviated as "Ltd.," and "Company" may be abbreviated as "Co."
Your LLC’s name must be distinguishable from the names of other business entities already on file with the Colorado Secretary of State. Names may be checked for availability by searching the Colorado Secretary of State business name database.
An available name may be reserved for 120 days by filing a Statement of Reservation of Name with the Colorado Secretary of State. The form must be filed online at the Secretary of State website. The filing fee is $25.
2. File Articles of Organization
A Colorado LLC is created by filing articles of organization online with the Colorado Secretary of State. You can view and download a sample articles of organization form on the Secretary of State’s website.
The articles must include the LLC's name and address; the name and address of LLC’s registered agent, the name and address of the person forming the LLC whether the LLC will be run by a manager or members, and a few other details.
The articles of organization must be filed online and the filing fee is $50.

All of the paperwork and procedural steps to start a limited liability company in Colorado can be done online using Nolo's Colorado Online LLC Formation application.
3. Appoint a Registered Agent
Every Colorado LLC must have an agent for service of process in the state. This is an individual or business entity that agrees to accept legal papers on the LLC’s behalf if it is sued. The agent should agree to accept service of process on behalf of the limited liability company prior to designation. The registered agent may be (1) an individual who is a full-time resident of Colorado, (2) a Colorado business entity with its principal place of business in Colorado, or (3) a foreign entity authorized to do business in Colorado and that has a usual place of business in the state.
4. Prepare an Operating Agreement
An LLC operating agreement is not required in Colorado, but is highly advisable. For help creating an LLC operating agreement, see Form Your Own Limited Liability Company, by Anthony Mancuso (Nolo) or use Nolo’s Online LLC. If an operating agreement is created, it need not be filed with the Articles of Organization.
5. Publication Requirements
None.
6. Comply With Other Tax and Regulatory Requirements
Additional tax and regulatory requirements may apply to your LLC. These may include:
EIN: If your LLC has more than one member, it must obtain its own IRS Employer Identification Number (EIN), even if it has no employees. If you form a one-member LLC, you must obtain an EIN for it only if it will have employees or you elect to have it taxed as a corporation instead of a sole proprietorship (disregarded entity). You may obtain an EIN by completing an online application on the IRS website. There is no filing fee.
Register with Department of Revenue: In some cases, for example if you will be selling goods and collecting sales tax or if you have employees, you’ll need to register with the Colorado Department of Revenue (DOR). For more information on state LLC tax registration, see Nolo's article LLC Annual Report and Tax Filing Requirements: A 50-State Guide.
Business Licenses: Depending on its type of business and where it is located, your LLC may need to obtain other local and state business licenses.
7. File Periodic (Annual) Reports
Colorado LLCs must file a Periodic Report with the Colorado Secretary of State each year. The report must be filed online at the Secretary of State website. The filing fee is $10. The periodic reports are due during the three month period beginning on the first day of the anniversary month of the month when the LLC was formed. For example, if you formed your SMLLC on June 15, the report would be due each subsequent year between June 1 and August 31. You can also file the report up two months early. You may sign-up for email notification from the Secretary of State to alert you when the Periodic Report is due.
8. Foreign LLCs Doing Business in Colorado
All LLCs organized outside of Colorado must register with the Colorado Secretary of State to do business in Colorado. Foreign LLCs must appoint a registered agent for service of process physically located in Colorado. To register, file a Statement of Foreign Entity Authority. The application may must be filed online. The filing fee is $100.
Before filing, make sure the LLC’s name is available in Colorado by checking the Colorado Secretary of State’s business name database. If the name is not available, the LLC must provide an assumed entity name for use in Colorado.

How do I report a claim?


Claims must be reported as soon as reasonably possible.  Please contact us by mail, email, or fax.  
Medmarc Insurance GroupAttn: Claims Reporting14280 Park Meadow Drive, Suite 300Chantilly, Virginia 20151
Email:  ClaimsReporting@Medmarc.com
Fax: (703) 652-1389
If you have questions about whether to report a claim, please refer to your policy, which includes requirements for reporting occurrences, claims, and lawsuits.  Medmarc's claims staff are also available to answer your questions and provide reporting advice.
Please contact our Claims Department at (800) 356-6886.


How do I access my loss information?


You can request a loss run via our Loss Run Request page. Please select “Loss Run Request” in the subject line and submit dates and name of insured in the additional information box.  You must be the Insured or the current Broker of Record to make this request.  You will receive your loss run report within one business day of request. 
Online loss run access is temporarily disabled until we go live with a new online portal later this year. 


How does Medmarc help me select the best defense attorney for my claim?


We have built a network of top-tier attorneys to defend your cases.  All of our attorneys are selected for their expertise in defending medical device and pharmaceutical companies in products liability litigation.  We leverage our buying power in order to secure you with reasonable hourly rates, and our attorneys are required to communicate with you regularly on the status of your claim.
Many of our network counsel have written and lectured on various aspects of product liability.  Some have medical or nursing degrees.  Many also have medical malpractice defense expertise.They are skilled trial attorneys, but they also have negotiating and case resolution skills that can achieve rational business outcomes at mediation and settlement conferences. 


How do I submit changes to our contact information?


Please select subject "Contact Underwriting" in the Request More Information Form on this page. 
Please provide information for your “primary contact,” including your contact’s first and last name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and email address.  If applicable, please also provide this information for any additional contacts for SIR billing, claims, risk management, and loss runs.


How does Medmarc handle a claim or lawsuit outside of the United States?


We have approved network counsel in many foreign countries.  In addition, when servicing foreign claims, we rely on a number of international resources for loss investigation and litigation control.  These include: 

GAB Robins Worldwide
Baker & McKenzie Worldwide Legal Network
Lex Mundi Directory of Foreign Counsel
American Law Firm Association (ALFA)
International Legal Network



What types of coverages does Medmarc provide?




Medmarc offers Products/Completed Operations Liability (“Products Liability”) and Manufacturers’ Errors and Omissions Liability (“E&O”) for medical technology and life sciences companies.
For more information on each coverage type, go to our Insurance Solutions


What kind of product recall coverage is available through Medmarc?


Coverage for FDA recalls may be found in two types of Medmarc coverage offerings. 

Products Liability — Medmarc offers product-withdrawal-expense coverage as an endorsement to our products liability policy.  This endorsement, subject to terms and exclusions, covers expenses incurred by the insured to remove its product from the marketplace due to a Class I product recall, including expenses associated with communicating the recall to the public. 
Manufacturers’ Errors & Omissions (E&O) — Medmarc offers recall coverage for third-party financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission, such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product.

Please talk to your Medmarc underwriter if your client has a need for this coverage or would like to learn more. 


What happens when I report a claim?


We typically assign the claim to a claim examiner upon receiving it.  The claim examiner will review and analyze the claim for coverage, liability, and damages issues and contact you normally within 24 hours.  
In litigated cases, we assist you in the selection of defense counsel, with whom we work closely until your matter is resolved.  Your input is crucial to a successful defense strategy, and your claim examiner will update you throughout the life of your claim—but no less frequently than on a quarterly basis—about the progress of bringing your claim to resolution.


Do Medmarc claim examiners specialize in life sciences?


Yes.  Medmarc has a team of experienced claim examiners dedicated to the life sciences industry, who handle only life sciences claims.  Each examiner has a minimum of ten years’ experience and hold a variety of degrees and designations including law degrees, actuarial degrees, and Associate in Claims (AIC) designations.  To remain on the cutting edge of developments in the law and the life sciences, Medmarc’s claim examiners participate regularly in industry educational programs. Medmarc is a proud corporate member of DRI, ALFA, and USLAW organizations.


I am not an insured, but may I still receive risk management assistance from Medmarc?




Our risk management services are intended for use by our insureds.  On a limited basis, however, we will provide products liability risk management services on a fee-for-service basis. 
For more information, please contact our Risk Management Department at RiskManagement@Medmarc.com or at 703-652-1362.


Is the fact that a product is approved by the FDA sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from Medmarc?




FDA approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis, as is the regulatory history of the company, but it is not sufficient information for Medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote. In order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs, underwriters also will require information about the company’s size, financial condition, management team, operations, loss history, and other information related to the company’s history and product lines.


What is Medmarc’s capacity?




For Medmarc’s products liability policy, our capacity is $10 million per policy.  For our manufacturers’ errors and omissions (E&O) policy, our capacity is $5 million.  
Capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants. 


What is Medmarc's target risk?




Medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, in vitro diagnostics, personal hygiene products, and animal care products.  We cover both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers.  We cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trial-stage startups to multi-national companies with extensive product lines.

Through our Risk Management Department, Medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks.  We can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk.  
We provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability, such as supply chains, product warnings and instructions for use, and manufacturing procedures.  There is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability.  For this reason, we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with FDA requirements. 
We also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line.


Will Medmarc accept other carriers’ applications?




Yes.  Medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers, but please be aware that we may require additional information.


As a distributor, do I need products liability coverage?




We recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies.  If a distributor is required to repackage or install a product, or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product, the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy.  Furthermore, independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements. A U.S. distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the United States should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the U.S. or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the U.S., which could become very costly.  Medmarc’s Risk Management Department has published an article that explains distributor risks. The article is titled, “Why Distributors May Be More  Vulnerable to Products Liability than They Realize,” and it is available on Medmarc’s website in our Resource Library.


Does your policy cover sales representatives (“sales reps”)?




The actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under Medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage. Such circumstances include when sales reps: (1) provide product consultations; (2) make device technical adjustments; (3) are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care; or (4) are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses.
For more information, see the Ask an Expert by Fran Stockwell, “Do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage?”
 


Does your policy cover explants of implantable devices?




Our products liability policy covers explantations (i.e., the surgical removal of implantable devices) only when the product causes the patient harm.


What is the difference between a claims-made policy and an occurrence policy?



Insurance coverage can either be on a "claims made" or "occurrence" basis. These terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period. A claims-made policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year (or tail period) regardless of when the loss occurred, and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year (as specified on the declarations form). A "claims made" policy provides coverage for claims made (and reported) during the policy term as long as they were made after the "retroactive date." (The retroactive date is the start date of the first claims-made policy obtained, so long as it has been kept active (via renewal).) That date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed. For example, if a client first obtains claims-made coverage on October 1, 2008, and it is now 2013 and they've maintained the same coverage, their claims-made policy covers all incidents since October 1, 2008. If the client no longer has coverage in 2014, and a patient sues in 2014 for an incident that occurred in 2008, the client does not have coverage for that incident (unless they purchased tail coverage). 
An "occurrence" policy, in contrast, covers incidents that occur (but are not necessarily reported) during the term the policy is in force. For example, if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering 2008-2009, and a patient is injured by the client's product in 2009, but does not sue for their injuries until 2011, the client has coverage from their 2008-2009 policy, even if they are no longer insured.


Will Medmarc provide coverage for non-medical products?




Because of our familiarity and long-standing connection with this industry, we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include non-medical products. Often, we can accommodate this coverage need.  Your Medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering non-medical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds.


What information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk?




For clinical trial submissions, include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review.


How do I obtain a quote for manufacturers' errors and omissions (E&O) coverage from Medmarc?




The E&O application can be found here. Along with a completed application, your Medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers.


How does Medmarc calculate minimum premiums?




Minimum premiums differ depending on several factors, such as a product’s risk profile and the state in which the company is located. 
If you have a small account and are interested discussing the cost of coverage in greater detail, please call George Ayd at (703) 652-1309.


What is Medmarc’s financial strength?




A.M. Best* Rating A (Excellent) With a Stable Outlook.
According to A.M. Best, an A (Excellent) rated company has "an excellent ability to meet their ongoing responsibilities to policyholders."
The stable outlook indicates "that [the company] is experiencing stable financial and market trends, and that there is a low likelihood that its rating will change in the near-term". 
For more information check out our Financial Strength page. 
*A. M. Best is the nation's leading independent insurance rating agency.
