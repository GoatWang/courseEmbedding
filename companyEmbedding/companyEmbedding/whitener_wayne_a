Ingredients

            We’re always thinking about natural ingredients, where they come from and what they can do for a healthy world. That’s because ingredients derived from nature and handled responsibly tell you something important about a product. Something that feels good. And feeling good is what our ingredients list is all about. You can plainly see every ingredient we use including its purpose and source. Thanks for digging deeper to discover what’s inside every Tom’s of Maine product.

Naturally Sourced and Derived
All of our ingredients originate from nature.  But your toothpaste isn’t filled with leaves or sand, so you are probably aware that all of our ingredients also go through some processing before making their way into the final product.  We use the terms “sourced” and “derived” as classifications for how much the ingredient has changed from how it is found in the source plant or mineral.    

We classify an ingredient as naturally sourced when the ingredient is not significantly changed from how it occurs in the identified source material.  An example of this is peppermint oil.  The peppermint oil we use in our products has been removed and concentrated but it is otherwise much the same as it would be found in the peppermint leaves.  
Naturally derived ingredients have gone through additional processing which modifies how they are found in their natural state.  This is generally done to improve the ingredient’s safety or efficacy.  An example of this is silica.  In its natural state silica would not be safe for use in our products as it would be too abrasive.  Another example is xanthan gum, which we use as a gelling agent in some of our products.  The original source of xanthan gum is vegetable matter (such as corn).  This vegetable matter goes through a fermentation process to prepare xanthan gum.  Since this processing step is involved and the ingredient isn’t extracted directly from the corn, we would classify this ingredient as “naturally derived”.
Acceptable preparation processes
In reviewing ingredients for our products – whether naturally sourced or derived – we do consider the preparation processes involved.  And it is our practice to only allow preparation processes which support our philosophy of human and environmental health.  Some of the guidelines we follow include:

We generally do not allow specific manufacturing processes like esterification with anhydrides, ethoxylation, propoxylation, oxidation with ozone and peroxides, quaternization, sulfonization, or nitration that lead to the creation of synthetic ingredients
All of the steps and ingredients used in the preparation should include materials of plant or mineral origin sourced in nature
We accept and allow naturally occurring processes (such as fermentation and saponification)


Find out More

We know  that the ingredients inside your natural personal care products matter, and we believe that you have a right to know what they are, what purpose they serve in your product, the natural source they come from and how are they are made.  Our ingredient fact sheets provide information on the purpose, source and processing of the ingredients we use and we are currently creating and updating fact sheets so that this information will be available for all of these ingredients.  Please contact us with any questions or comments!  Every ingredient we use should be a reflection of our commitment to you, our communities and our planet, and we welcome your feedback.

You’ve always believed it’s what’s inside that counts. We hope you’ll apply that same rule to our products. We’re proud of our ingredients and want you to know about each one, including its purpose and source.

What’s Not in Our Products
Our commitment to our customers is also defined by the ingredients we avoid and the ingredient choices we offer.
Artificial Colors
Because we do not add artificial colors, the appearance of our products may vary from batch to batch.
Artificial Flavors or Fragrances
We do not use any synthetic flavors or fragrances. Our customers prefer the fresh, natural taste and smell of herbs, fruits, and flowers (or no fragrance at all!).
Artificial preservatives (EDTA, formaldehyde, parabens, etc.)
Natural preservatives work as well or better than artificial alternatives.
Animal ingredients
 The majority of our products are vegan, as we have worked to find plant based alternatives for ingredients which are typically made from animal ingredients. For example, the glycerin used in many toothpastes and soaps can be an animal ingredient, while ours is plant based.

Product Certification
We’ve always respected and welcomed our customers’ values and priorities. Tom’s of Maine product certifications reflect important choices we offer in response.The American Dental Association's Seal of Acceptance, first awarded in 1931, is a trusted symbol of a dental product's safety and effectiveness. In order to earn the Seal, manufacturers must submit studies that demonstrate equivalent safety and effectiveness results to those of a clinically tested product; maintain manufacturing and laboratory facilities up to established safety and purity standards; and submit ingredient lists and product information for review and approval.
In 1995, our original formula with fluoride was deemed safe and effective by the American Dental Association (ADA), becoming the first natural toothpaste to bear the ADA's Seal of Acceptance. Since then, many more of our products have earned the Seal.

Product Research
At Tom's of Maine, we are as serious about good science and effective products as we are about our belief in sustainability and social responsibility. Our team of distinguished dentists, scientists, and herbal experts are leaders in their fields, and their innovative methods and extensive research result in effective natural products that deliver key benefits using plants and minerals.
Please take a peek into the professional activities of our product research and development team (both past and present)— we're very proud of the work they do.

PRONAMEL®

Protection For Your Enamel
Your tooth enamel is there to protect your teeth from damage. But did you know that acids in everyday foods can soften the surface of your enamel, making it more vulnerable to being worn away over time? And the problem is, once the enamel is gone, it can't be repaired or replaced.

FAQ










Tooth Sensitivity FAQs:







What is tooth sensitivity?






Dentin hypersensitivity, or tooth sensitivity, is a common dental problem that can arise when dentin, the inner part of the tooth, becomes exposed. It’s a condition that can develop over time, as a result of common problems such as receding gums and enamel wear. 
Find out What Causes Sensitive Teeth








What causes tooth sensitivity?






Tooth sensitivity can start to happen when the softer, inner part of the tooth called ‘dentin’ becomes exposed. Dentin lies under the enamel and the gums. Thousands of microscopic channels run through the dentin towards the center of the tooth. Once the dentin is exposed, external triggers (such as a cold drink) can stimulate the nerves inside the tooth, resulting in the characteristic short, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity.
See What Causes Sensitive Teeth to find out more








How can I protect myself against sensitivity?






Talk to your dentist about the symptoms you are experiencing. They can confirm that tooth sensitivity is the cause of your problem and then advise you on how to care for sensitive teeth, for example, what is the best toothbrushing technique for you, how often and when. In addition, you can relieve the painful symptoms of tooth sensitivity by changing your regular toothpaste to a daily use toothpaste specially formulated to treat sensitive teeth, such as Sensodyne®
See Ongoing Oral Care For Sensitive Teeth to find out more 








What triggers sensitive teeth?






A range of things can trigger a twinge or tooth pain for people with sensitive teeth. Here’s some of the most common triggers for tooth sensitivity:

Cold foods or beverages
Hot foods or beverages
Sugary foods
Sour foods
Breathing in cold air
Brushing teeth 

See Common Triggers of Sensitive Teeth to find out more.








Is tooth sensitivity a common dental problem?






Yes. Sensitive teeth may affect as many as 1 in 3 people, even young adults. Most sufferers are between 20 and 50 years old.








Is tooth sensitivity a sign of a more serious dental problem?






There can be many different causes of dental pain other than tooth sensitivity. So if you are feeling any tooth pain or discomfort, especially if it persists, the best thing you can do is visit your dentist and seek professional advice. 
See Other Reasons for Sensitivity to find out more.








Can brushing too hard cause sensitive teeth?






Brushing overly aggressively or more frequently than your dentist recommends can contribute to gum recession and wear enamel. Over time, receding gums and enamel loss can lead to exposed dentin and tooth sensitivity.
See Other Reasons for Sensitivity to find out more








Can tooth whitening cause sensitivity?






Tooth whitening here means whitening treatments carried out under the supervision of your dentist. These treatments contain bleaching agents (peroxide), which are known to cause sensitivity in some patients. This is not the same as dentin hypersensitivity, which happens as a result of having exposed dentin (the softer, inner part of the tooth). Speak to your dentist about bleaching-related sensitivity if you are considering having a tooth whitening treatment.
See do Whitening Treatments Cause Sensitivity for more information













Acid Erosion FAQs:







What is acid erosion?






The wearing away of enamel, caused by acid in our diet, is called "Acid Wear." As few as four acidic "occasions" throughout the day can put our enamel at risk from acid wear. If your tooth enamel is at risk of acid wear, ask your dentist about the issue, for dietary advice, how best to consume the many acidic foods and drinks in the modern diet and the best oral hygiene routine for you.
To learn more go to ProNamel.com








What causes acid erosion?






Over time, acidic foods and drinks can cause your teeth enamel to wear down. These include fruit and fruit juices, carbonated drinks, black coffee or tea, wine and anything that tastes sharp, like ketchup or salad dressing. To help protect your teeth against acid erosion, talk to your dentist and use a fluoride toothpaste specially developed for people at risk of acid wear, such as ProNamel®. Ask your dentist for dietary advice on the best oral hygiene routine for you and how best to consume the many acidic foods and drinks in the modern diet.
To learn more, go to ProNamel.com.








Can acid erosion cause teeth sensitivity?






Yes. Acid erosion can contribute to enamel wear. Enamel is the hard outer layer of a tooth. Although it’s harder than any other substance in the body, with time it can gradually be worn away to expose the layer of dentin beneath, which may lead to tooth sensitivity.













Frequent questions about toothpaste for sensitivity







What is the #1 dentist recommended toothpaste for sensitive teeth?






Sensodyne® toothpaste is the #1 dentist recommended toothpaste for sensitive teeth. 9 out of 10 dentists recommend it for patients with sensitive teeth.








How do desensitizing toothpastes work?






People with exposed dentin are susceptible to tooth sensitivity, triggered, for example, by cold drinks or hot food. Sensodyne® formulas work in two different ways: Sensodyne® toothpastes with potassium nitrate works to soothe the nerves inside the tooth. Sensodyne® Repair & Protect with stannous fluoride builds a robust reparative layer over the exposed dentin to create a barrier to pain triggers.  Each Sensodyne® toothpaste, is proven to relieve the pain of tooth sensitivity with twice daily brushing*. 








Does Sensodyne® toothpaste come in different variants?






Sensodyne® toothpaste comes in many different variations to meet individual needs and preference:

Sensodyne® Original Flavor toothpaste
Sensodyne® Extra Whitening toothpaste
Sensodyne® Fresh Impact toothpaste
Sensodyne® Fresh Mint toothpaste
Sensodyne® Cool Gel toothpaste
Sensodyne® Full Protection Plus Whitening toothpaste
Sensodyne® Tartar Control Plus Whitening toothpaste
Sensodyne® Repair & Protect
Sensodyne® Repair & Protect Extra Fresh
Sensodyne® Repair & Protect Whitening
Sensodyne® Complete Protection
Sensodyne® Complete Protection Extra Fresh









Does Sensodyne® toothpaste have a tooth whitening formulation?






Yes. Sensodyne® formulations are available in Sensodyne® Repair & Protect Whitening toothpaste, Sensodyne® Extra Whitening toothpaste, Sensodyne® Full Protection Plus Whitening toothpaste, Sensodyne® Tartar Control Plus Whitening toothpaste, Sensodyne® Complete Protection toothpaste and Sensodyne® Complete Protection Extra Fresh toothpaste.








How often should I use Sensodyne® toothpaste?






We would recommend using Sensodyne® toothpaste twice a day, every day, in place of your regular toothpaste for ongoing protection from tooth sensitivity. Ask your dentist for advice about the best oral hygiene routine for you. 








How long will I use Sensodyne® before I notice less sensitivity?






Sensitivity toothpastes require a period of twice daily use to benefit from lasting protection against the pain of dentinal hypersensitivity. 
Clinical studies have shown that Sensodyne® toothpastes containing stannous fluoride (Sensodyne® Repair and Protect) relieve tooth sensitivity in 4 weeks, with twice daily brushing*.
Always read the label and follow the directions for use. Sensitive teeth may indicate an underlying problem that needs prompt care. If symptoms persist or worsen, see your dentist. 








Once I stop using Sensodyne® toothpaste will my tooth sensitivity return?






Clinical studies investigating the efficacy of potassium nitrate-containing sensitivity toothpastes have shown that the pain of sensitive teeth begins to return when usage stopped.
Sensodyne® toothpastes are daily use toothpastes, developed to help relieve dentin hypersensitivity, when used as directed, twice a day, every day.
Please consult your dentist for advice about sensitive teeth, and the best oral hygiene routine and toothpaste for you.
Always read the label and follow the directions for us. Sensitive teeth may indicate an underlying problem that needs prompt care. If symptoms persist or worsen, see your dentist.
 








Why should children under 12 consult a dentist before using Sensodyne® toothpaste?






Sensodyne® toothpaste is not recommended for use by children under the age of 12.  Sensitivity is rarely a problem in children that young. Check with your child's dentist for appropriate advice and recommendation.








Does Sensodyne® toothpaste contain fluoride?






All Sensodyne® toothpastes variants contain fluoride, except Sensodyne® Classic.








Does Sensodyne® contain triclosan?






Sensodyne® toothpastes do not contain triclosan








Is Sensodyne® toothpaste available as a travel-sized tube?






Sensodyne® toothpaste is available in a travel-sized tube in major retail outlets.








Can I use mouthwash after brushing with Sensodyne® toothpaste?






Yes, you may use mouthwash after using Sensodyne® toothpaste. Ask your dentist for advice on the best oral hygiene routine for you. 
Sensodyne® offers a daily use mouthrinse specially formulated to help protect against tooth sensitivity, and also contains fluoride to help strengthen your teeth. 








What is the Relative Dentin Abrasion (RDA) for Sensodyne® toothpaste?






All Sensodyne® toothpastes comply with the American Dental Association (ADA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines for daily use dentifrices. Sensodyne® toothpastes have low RDA values in the range of 35-140, depending on variants (and market). Sensodyne® ProNamel® toothpaste, has a low RDA value of approximately 35.








Do Sensodyne® toothpaste tooth-whitening formulas actually bleach as well as relieve sensitivity?






Sensodyne® toothpaste whitening formulas do not bleach. They contain a matrix of polishing and cleaning ingredients which all contribute to their tooth cleaning and whitening effect with twice daily brushing. Sensodyne® toothpaste variants contain proven desensitizing active ingredients.








Is Sensodyne® toothpaste safe to use during tooth-whitening treatments?






Dentin hypersensitivity is a common and painful condition of the teeth which can arise when the dentin of the tooth becomes exposed (typically as a result of gingival recession or tooth wear). The sensitivity which can be experienced during and after professional whitening treatments is different. In this case, the bleaching component of the treatments is believed to penetrate the tooth, causing sensitivity.
Clinical studies indicate that toothpastes containing potassium nitrate can reduce the sensitivity associated with professional whitening procedures. In these studies, subjects using Sensodyne® with potassium nitrate for two weeks prior to, and during whitening treatment experienced less sensitivity post treatment, compared to those using a regular fluoride toothpaste.
Speak to your dentist about bleaching-related sensitivity if you are considering having a tooth whitening treatment. Use Sensodyne® products as directed on the product label.








How does Sensodyne® True White® work?






Sensodyne® True White® contains the inactive ingredient sodium tripolyphosphate, which gently removes and prevents extrinsic tooth stains. Sensodyne® True White® also contains potassium nitrate, which helps relieve sensitivity. With twice daily brushing, Sensodyne® True White® helps minimize the wear that many other higher abrasivity whitening toothpastes may cause.

This innovation actually removes odor molecules and detergent residues left by ordinary detergents.Most detergents mask odors by leaving a layer of soap residue on your clothes.  This soap residue is only a temporary mask which is why odors later return.  ProWash cleans and rinses thoroughly and in the process, restores the fabric wicking.  Your clothing is fresh, clean and looks like new!ProWash Detergent is safe for all the most common fabrics (cotton, polyester, wool, etc.) and widely-used activewear fabrics, including:    CoolMax ®  Kuhl-Dry Paclite ® Tencel  ®   CoolTech ® Lycra ® Pilayo™ Under   Armour ®   Dry-Fit ® Lyocell Polartec ® UpCycle ®    Dryflex ® Meryl ® Polyamide  Velucitek™    Dryline ® Microfiber Spandex  Viscose    Elastane Micropoly Supplex  ® w/AMY ®    Gore-Tex ® MYNX ® Switchback  ® Wick-Dry ®    Herringbone Nylon  Tactel ®   Available Size(s): 24 fl. oz.Cleaning Tips:ProWash Activewear Detergent is safe for use on all fabrics and in all temperatures.  When pre-treating, always check for colorfastness. ProWash works in both regular and high efficiency washers and can also be used for hand washing. One unit of ProWash detergent is conveniently measured by using the dispensing window located on the right hand side of this energy efficient package. Each line represents one Unit (equivalent to 1 fl. oz.) of all temperature ProWash. (Measuring Alternative: REUSE the cap of your ordinary detergent--just fill to the first line or 2 tbsp. = 1 fl. oz.). Pre-Treating your specialty fabricsTo pre-treat on stains rub a small amount directly into the stain before washing. Always check an inside seam for colorfastness prior to treating stains.  Works great on grass and blood stains!Top Load Washers - Medium Loads:2 UnitsHigh Efficiency Washers - Medium Loads:   1 UnitFront Load Washers - Medium Loads: 1.5 UnitsHand Washing:1.5 Units Per 5 Gallons of Water

  Teeth Whitening at Walgreens Almost everyone would be happy to have a whiter smile. Several factors can lead to teeth becoming discolored over time, but modern technology has devised new ways to remove stains and restore whiteness. Walgreens has a wide selection of whitening products that can make your teeth look better than ever. Effective and easy to use, they'll brighten your smile and help boost your self-confidence. Causes of Tooth Discoloration Any number of factors can be responsible for your teeth changing colors over time. Certain drinks, such as coffee, tea, cola, and wine, can all pass their colors onto teeth when consumed regularly. Other highly acidic foods and drinks may dissolve some of the enamel on your teeth and reveal the yellowish layer of dentin underneath. Tobacco use is another major contributor to discoloration-especially when chewed. A few less common causes of yellowing include side effects from certain medications, excessive fluoride in water sources, and diseases that attack enamel. Any of these factors are made worse when combined with poor oral hygiene. How Whitening Products Work The number one ingredient in almost every commercially-available whitening product is hydrogen peroxide. A bleaching agent that is safe to use inside your mouth, hydrogen peroxide forms bubbles that are able to lift the stains out of your enamel and leave your teeth looking whiter. The main distinction between the different types of whitening products is the way in which the hydrogen peroxide is delivered. Popular methods include toothpastes, mouthwashes, whitening strips, and trays used with whitening gels. Popular Methods of Whitening Some people opt for professional whitening treatments but now there are over-the-counter products that are highly effective. Whitening toothpastes and whitening mouthwashes are the easiest products to fit into your daily routine. Used like any other toothpaste or rinse, these products have hydrogen peroxide among their ingredients, and the agent is designed to remain on your teeth even after you are done with your oral care routine so that it targets stains throughout the day. Slightly less convenient but much more effective are the "barrier methods" of whitening-which include whitening strips and trays. These products are applied to your teeth and allowed to sit there for about 30 minutes a day depending on the product. They provide constant contact between your teeth and the peroxide, which makes them the most powerful at-home whitening tools. Trays in the shape of the average mouth are filled with gel that has a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide. You then place it in your mouth and bite down for the recommended amount of time. Whitening strips, on the other hand, already have the hydrogen peroxide agent applied, so all you have to do is adhere the strip to your teeth and leave it in place for the stated amount of time. Strips and trays usually both take about two weeks to show results, but some products have especially high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and work more quickly. It's common to feel a little extra sensitive after using whitening products. The molecules that are responsible for bleaching can occasionally get trapped within your nerve passageways and increase sensitivity. Effects are usually temporary and should wear off within a few hours or days. No matter what whitening method you prefer, you will soon be on your way to a brighter smile. Browse the selection of oral care products available from Walgreens and choose the one that seems best for you. But be sure to see your dentist regularly.

Ingredients

            We’re always thinking about natural ingredients, where they come from and what they can do for a healthy world. That’s because ingredients derived from nature and handled responsibly tell you something important about a product. Something that feels good. And feeling good is what our ingredients list is all about. You can plainly see every ingredient we use including its purpose and source. Thanks for digging deeper to discover what’s inside every Tom’s of Maine product.

Naturally Sourced and Derived
All of our ingredients originate from nature.  But your toothpaste isn’t filled with leaves or sand, so you are probably aware that all of our ingredients also go through some processing before making their way into the final product.  We use the terms “sourced” and “derived” as classifications for how much the ingredient has changed from how it is found in the source plant or mineral.    

We classify an ingredient as naturally sourced when the ingredient is not significantly changed from how it occurs in the identified source material.  An example of this is peppermint oil.  The peppermint oil we use in our products has been removed and concentrated but it is otherwise much the same as it would be found in the peppermint leaves.  
Naturally derived ingredients have gone through additional processing which modifies how they are found in their natural state.  This is generally done to improve the ingredient’s safety or efficacy.  An example of this is silica.  In its natural state silica would not be safe for use in our products as it would be too abrasive.  Another example is xanthan gum, which we use as a gelling agent in some of our products.  The original source of xanthan gum is vegetable matter (such as corn).  This vegetable matter goes through a fermentation process to prepare xanthan gum.  Since this processing step is involved and the ingredient isn’t extracted directly from the corn, we would classify this ingredient as “naturally derived”.
Acceptable preparation processes
In reviewing ingredients for our products – whether naturally sourced or derived – we do consider the preparation processes involved.  And it is our practice to only allow preparation processes which support our philosophy of human and environmental health.  Some of the guidelines we follow include:

We generally do not allow specific manufacturing processes like esterification with anhydrides, ethoxylation, propoxylation, oxidation with ozone and peroxides, quaternization, sulfonization, or nitration that lead to the creation of synthetic ingredients
All of the steps and ingredients used in the preparation should include materials of plant or mineral origin sourced in nature
We accept and allow naturally occurring processes (such as fermentation and saponification)


Find out More

We know  that the ingredients inside your natural personal care products matter, and we believe that you have a right to know what they are, what purpose they serve in your product, the natural source they come from and how are they are made.  Our ingredient fact sheets provide information on the purpose, source and processing of the ingredients we use and we are currently creating and updating fact sheets so that this information will be available for all of these ingredients.  Please contact us with any questions or comments!  Every ingredient we use should be a reflection of our commitment to you, our communities and our planet, and we welcome your feedback.

You’ve always believed it’s what’s inside that counts. We hope you’ll apply that same rule to our products. We’re proud of our ingredients and want you to know about each one, including its purpose and source.











VIEW ALL INGREDIENTS

 




What’s Not in Our Products
Our commitment to our customers is also defined by the ingredients we avoid and the ingredient choices we offer.
Artificial Colors
Because we do not add artificial colors, the appearance of our products may vary from batch to batch.
Artificial Flavors or Fragrances
We do not use any synthetic flavors or fragrances. Our customers prefer the fresh, natural taste and smell of herbs, fruits, and flowers (or no fragrance at all!).
Artificial preservatives (EDTA, formaldehyde, parabens, etc.)
Natural preservatives work as well or better than artificial alternatives.
Animal ingredients
 The majority of our products are vegan, as we have worked to find plant based alternatives for ingredients which are typically made from animal ingredients. For example, the glycerin used in many toothpastes and soaps can be an animal ingredient, while ours is plant based.

Product Certification
We’ve always respected and welcomed our customers’ values and priorities. Tom’s of Maine product certifications reflect important choices we offer in response.The American Dental Association's Seal of Acceptance, first awarded in 1931, is a trusted symbol of a dental product's safety and effectiveness. In order to earn the Seal, manufacturers must submit studies that demonstrate equivalent safety and effectiveness results to those of a clinically tested product; maintain manufacturing and laboratory facilities up to established safety and purity standards; and submit ingredient lists and product information for review and approval.
In 1995, our original formula with fluoride was deemed safe and effective by the American Dental Association (ADA), becoming the first natural toothpaste to bear the ADA's Seal of Acceptance. Since then, many more of our products have earned the Seal.

Product Research
At Tom's of Maine, we are as serious about good science and effective products as we are about our belief in sustainability and social responsibility. Our team of distinguished dentists, scientists, and herbal experts are leaders in their fields, and their innovative methods and extensive research result in effective natural products that deliver key benefits using plants and minerals.
Please take a peek into the professional activities of our product research and development team (both past and present)— we're very proud of the work they do.

The Colgate® Optic White® Toothbrush is specially designed with stain removers and polishing bristles to help remove surface stains.

If you have dental work, consult your dentist before using. It is not intended to whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings or dentures.

PRONAMEL®









Show All Products






























Protection For Your Enamel
Your tooth enamel is there to protect your teeth from damage. But did you know that acids in everyday foods can soften the surface of your enamel, making it more vulnerable to being worn away over time? And the problem is, once the enamel is gone, it can't be repaired or replaced.
ProNamel® toothpaste actively strengthens weakened enamel and helps prevent further wear while keeping your teeth and gums healthy.

How does Pronamel work?

FAQ










Tooth Sensitivity FAQs:







What is tooth sensitivity?






Dentin hypersensitivity, or tooth sensitivity, is a common dental problem that can arise when dentin, the inner part of the tooth, becomes exposed. It’s a condition that can develop over time, as a result of common problems such as receding gums and enamel wear. 
Find out What Causes Sensitive Teeth








What causes tooth sensitivity?






Tooth sensitivity can start to happen when the softer, inner part of the tooth called ‘dentin’ becomes exposed. Dentin lies under the enamel and the gums. Thousands of microscopic channels run through the dentin towards the center of the tooth. Once the dentin is exposed, external triggers (such as a cold drink) can stimulate the nerves inside the tooth, resulting in the characteristic short, sharp pain of tooth sensitivity.
See What Causes Sensitive Teeth to find out more








How can I protect myself against sensitivity?






Talk to your dentist about the symptoms you are experiencing. They can confirm that tooth sensitivity is the cause of your problem and then advise you on how to care for sensitive teeth, for example, what is the best toothbrushing technique for you, how often and when. In addition, you can relieve the painful symptoms of tooth sensitivity by changing your regular toothpaste to a daily use toothpaste specially formulated to treat sensitive teeth, such as Sensodyne®

What triggers sensitive teeth?






A range of things can trigger a twinge or tooth pain for people with sensitive teeth. Here’s some of the most common triggers for tooth sensitivity:

Cold foods or beverages
Hot foods or beverages
Sugary foods
Sour foods
Breathing in cold air
Brushing teeth 

See Common Triggers of Sensitive Teeth to find out more.








Is tooth sensitivity a common dental problem?






Yes. Sensitive teeth may affect as many as 1 in 3 people, even young adults. Most sufferers are between 20 and 50 years old.








Is tooth sensitivity a sign of a more serious dental problem?






There can be many different causes of dental pain other than tooth sensitivity. So if you are feeling any tooth pain or discomfort, especially if it persists, the best thing you can do is visit your dentist and seek professional advice. 
See Other Reasons for Sensitivity to find out more.








Can brushing too hard cause sensitive teeth?






Brushing overly aggressively or more frequently than your dentist recommends can contribute to gum recession and wear enamel. Over time, receding gums and enamel loss can lead to exposed dentin and tooth sensitivity.
See Other Reasons for Sensitivity to find out more








Can tooth whitening cause sensitivity?






Tooth whitening here means whitening treatments carried out under the supervision of your dentist. These treatments contain bleaching agents (peroxide), which are known to cause sensitivity in some patients. This is not the same as dentin hypersensitivity, which happens as a result of having exposed dentin (the softer, inner part of the tooth). Speak to your dentist about bleaching-related sensitivity if you are considering having a tooth whitening treatment.

Acid Erosion FAQs:







What is acid erosion?






The wearing away of enamel, caused by acid in our diet, is called "Acid Wear." As few as four acidic "occasions" throughout the day can put our enamel at risk from acid wear. If your tooth enamel is at risk of acid wear, ask your dentist about the issue, for dietary advice, how best to consume the many acidic foods and drinks in the modern diet and the best oral hygiene routine for you.
To learn more go to ProNamel.com








What causes acid erosion?






Over time, acidic foods and drinks can cause your teeth enamel to wear down. These include fruit and fruit juices, carbonated drinks, black coffee or tea, wine and anything that tastes sharp, like ketchup or salad dressing. To help protect your teeth against acid erosion, talk to your dentist and use a fluoride toothpaste specially developed for people at risk of acid wear, such as ProNamel®. Ask your dentist for dietary advice on the best oral hygiene routine for you and how best to consume the many acidic foods and drinks in the modern diet.
To learn more, go to ProNamel.com.








Can acid erosion cause teeth sensitivity?






Yes. Acid erosion can contribute to enamel wear. Enamel is the hard outer layer of a tooth. Although it’s harder than any other substance in the body, with time it can gradually be worn away to expose the layer of dentin beneath, which may lead to tooth sensitivity.

How long will I use Sensodyne® before I notice less sensitivity?

What is the Relative Dentin Abrasion (RDA) for Sensodyne® toothpaste?






All Sensodyne® toothpastes comply with the American Dental Association (ADA), Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) guidelines for daily use dentifrices. Sensodyne® toothpastes have low RDA values in the range of 35-140, depending on variants (and market). Sensodyne® ProNamel® toothpaste, has a low RDA value of approximately 35.








Do Sensodyne® toothpaste tooth-whitening formulas actually bleach as well as relieve sensitivity?






Sensodyne® toothpaste whitening formulas do not bleach. They contain a matrix of polishing and cleaning ingredients which all contribute to their tooth cleaning and whitening effect with twice daily brushing. Sensodyne® toothpaste variants contain proven desensitizing active ingredients.








Is Sensodyne® toothpaste safe to use during tooth-whitening treatments?






Dentin hypersensitivity is a common and painful condition of the teeth which can arise when the dentin of the tooth becomes exposed (typically as a result of gingival recession or tooth wear). The sensitivity which can be experienced during and after professional whitening treatments is different. In this case, the bleaching component of the treatments is believed to penetrate the tooth, causing sensitivity.
Clinical studies indicate that toothpastes containing potassium nitrate can reduce the sensitivity associated with professional whitening procedures. In these studies, subjects using Sensodyne® with potassium nitrate for two weeks prior to, and during whitening treatment experienced less sensitivity post treatment, compared to those using a regular fluoride toothpaste.
Speak to your dentist about bleaching-related sensitivity if you are considering having a tooth whitening treatment. Use Sensodyne® products as directed on the product label.
