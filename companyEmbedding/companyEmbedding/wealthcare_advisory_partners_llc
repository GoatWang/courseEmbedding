Our Company













ADK | Wealthcare Partners is a boutique financial firm which provides financial stewardship, creative solutions, risk and asset management, outcome accountability, and a fiduciary standard of care.

Al Kaufman, CFP®, MBA and CPA originated this private wealth management and consulting firm in 2010 after gleaning insights from two publicly traded financial service firms over an eight year period. His firm, ADK | Wealthcare Partners, is dedicated to helping families and institutions thrive. He has served in leadership and financial management capacities throughout his career. Professional highlights, predating current role, include responsibilities as: Chief Operating Officer, VP Product Development, Financial Director, Successor Trustee, Executor, Adjunct Professor of Finance, and Manager of Medical Economics—which included oversight of corporate treasury functions and a $300 million portfolio.


MOTTO


Fundamentally different by design.


OUR COMMITMENT


We help families and institutions thrive by providing financial stewardship, creative solutions, risk and asset management, outcome accountability, and a fiduciary standard of care.

Al Kaufman, owner-manager, is the primary contact for clients. A broad range of institutional and advisory resources are used in providing services. Resources include unbiased research, financial planning professionals, domestic and foreign investment strategists, peer review, geopolitical intelligence, pastoral insights, attorneys, and CPAs. 


PRACTICE DISTINCTIVES


We believe that people have unique aspirations.


Therefore we listen and design strategies and monitoring systems around your unique priorities and resources.

We believe planning, accountability, context, credentials and capabilities are fundamentally important in the pursuit of successful financial outcomes.


Therefore this framework is woven into our practice.

We believe people need ongoing guidance to remain confident in their life journey.


Therefore we employ sophisticated financial planning tools, risk controls, unbiased research, disciplined investment strategies, and timely feedback to help keep you on track.

We believe people need trustworthy guidance and comfort that they are heading in the right direction.


Therefore we embrace the belief that outcome measurements should revolve around client objectives first and foremost.

We believe that context drives strategy.


Therefore we access respected sources from around the globe and take worldview, geopolitical, and economic factors into consideratrion—as they all influence financial markets.

We believe that competence should not be taken for granted.


Therefore we stay current, maintain professional credentials that extend beyond the realm of industry licensing, and work with professionals who have also paid the price that excellence demands in their respective fields.

We believe that extensive capabilities are needed in today’s complex and interdependent world.


Therefore ADK | Wealthcare Partners aligns with LPL Financial and Wealthcare Advisory Partners LLC in order to provide the depth and breadth of products, services, support, and oversight that clients need.
