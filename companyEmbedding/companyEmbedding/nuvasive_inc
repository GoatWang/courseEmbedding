NuVasive, Inc., based in San Diego, California, is a medical device company focused on the design, development, and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders.[1] NuVasive is a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUVA.
NuVasive’s product portfolio is focused on applications in the over $4.2 billion U.S. spine fusion market. The Company's current principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS, as well as a growing offering of cervical and motion preservation products.
MAS combines three categories of NuVasive’s current product offerings: NeuroVision, a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance system; MaXcess, a unique split-blade design retraction system; and specialized implants. The MAS platform enables procedures such as XLIF, or eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, a minimally disruptive spine surgery that accesses the spine through the patient’s side. This procedure is a more modern surgical option for treatment of scoliosis than the Harrington Rod, which is no longer used.

NuVasive To Study Safety Of Cervical Product


	
	
	NuVasive Files IDE for Cerpass Cervical Total Disc Replacement
Product



San Diego, CA — July 6, 2005 — NuVasive, Inc. announced that 
it filed for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) from the 
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate the 
safety and efficacy of its Cerpass cervical Total Disc Replacement 
(TDR) product on June 30, 2005 as planned.  Approval of the IDE from 
the FDA would allow the Company to initiate a pivotal human clinical 
study of the device in the U.S.

TDR replaces a damaged or degenerative diseased spinal disc and 
allows for flexibility in that space by retaining the normal 
biomechanics of the spine and preserving natural range of motion 
versus the traditional fusion procedures which replace the disc with 
implants that bridge the space and facilitate new bone growth to 
eliminate motion.

NuVasive's Cerpass cervical TDR product incorporates a ceramic-on-
ceramic design that the Company believes increases durability and 
eliminates the potential problems of wear debris from other bearing 
surfaces such as polyethylene. In pre-clinical testing, the Cerpass compared favorably to other artificial spinal discs currently in 
FDA clinical studies. Cerpass is also designed to ensure proper 
placement because of its "self-centering" feature.  Cerpass is 
designed for implantation through an anterior approach to the 
cervical region of the spine (front of the neck). 

Alexis V. Lukianov, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The 
IDE filing for U.S. clinical trials of our Cerpass cervical TDR 
product represents a major milestone in NuVasive's artificial disc 
development efforts for motion preservation of the neck vertebrae. 
We believe the ceramic-on-ceramic design will achieve superior long-
term wear characteristics compared to that of other bearing 
surfaces. Our initial TDR focus continues to be on the cervical 
region of the spine.  We believe it offers a more substantial market 
opportunity and will experience a broader, more rapid adoption by 
spine surgeons particularly when coupled with our "self-centering" 
feature to simplify implantation.  We plan to discuss the details of 
the FDA study for our Cerpass following IDE approval."

NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA) Launches New Products  











Tweet








9/27/2006 12:50:21 PM



    SAN DIEGO, Sept. 26 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- NuVasive, Inc. , a medical device company focused on developing products for minimally disruptive surgical treatments for the spine, announced today the launch of several new products within the Company's MAS(TM) Platform.  The newly launched products include:

    Product Category          Product(s) Being Launched

    Access Systems            MaXcess(R) III retraction system

    Instrument Sets           Redesigned instrument sets for each of the
                              following lumbar fusion procedures:
                                * ALIF (anterior lumbar interbody fusion)
                                * PLIF (posterior lumbar interbody fusion)
                                * TLIF (transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion
                                * XLIF(R) (eXtreme lateral interbody fusion)

    Specialized Implants       CoRoent(R) LX;
                               CoRoent XL-L; and
                               CoRoent S-L

    MaXcess III is a further enhancement of the Company's MaXcess and MaXcess II systems, with the addition of several features that improve access to the spine.  MaXcess III maintains the split-blade design and continues to incorporate the Company's NeuroVision nerve avoidance technology within the posterior retraction blade. MaXcess III adds a removable fourth blade, which provides greater posterior surgical options and incorporates an improved tilted blade-locking mechanism.
    NuVasive also launched a major redesign of its instrument sets for use in all lumbar spine fusion procedures. This significant design and engineering effort has resulted in best-in-class instruments, a simplified ordering structure and more efficient surgery execution. The simplified and logical set configurations have reduced the number of trays required for a specific surgical procedure, thus making ordering easier for hospitals. In our continued focus on Absolute Responsiveness to Customers, the redesigned instrument sets were developed from the Company's comprehensive understanding of the many surgical nuances specific to each surgeon and were designed to provide seamless utility with all NuVasive lumbar systems.
    The Company launched three new CoRoent systems providing surgeons with improved anatomical reconstruction characteristics. All of the systems are radiolucent, giving the surgeon a full view of the patient's anatomy during surgery and include radio dense titanium markers, enabling the surgeon to visually confirm their correct placement during and after surgery.
    The Company has also gained initial clinical experience with the following three products, each of which is scheduled for limited release in the fourth quarter of 2006:

    Product Category           Product(s) Being Launched

    Specialized Implants       Lateral Lumbar XLIF Plate

    Nerve Monitoring System    NeuroVision(R) enhanced with Motor Evoked
                               Potentials (MEP) capability; and NeuroVision
                               Remote Monitoring(R)

    The Lateral Lumbar XLIF Plate is designed for use during the Company's proprietary XLIF procedure and allows for the placement of a fixation device through the same incision used for placing CoRoent systems. This provides the option to use a plate for fixation through an existing incision rather than utilizing pedicle screws. Planned NeuroVision upgrades now incorporate MEP technology for complete monitoring of nerve activity in the thoracic and cervical regions of the spine. The system also includes numerous software upgrades, providing enhanced user interface.  In addition, the Company plans to launch NeuroVision upgrades allowing for Remote Monitoring, providing surgeons the ability to monitor surgeries both intraoperatively and remotely, allowing for greater case coverage.
    Alexis V. Lukianov, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said, "The launch of these new products maintains our position at the forefront introducing innovative minimally disruptive spine surgery technologies. We are particularly excited about our MaXcess III retractor. We believe the enhanced features of this retractor provide surgeons with the maximum amount of access to the patient's spine in a safe and reproducible minimally disruptive procedure. We expect that this product will continue to stimulate increased use of our innovative implants.  Our instrument set redesign, along with our recently announced Memphis distribution facility, will provide increased speed of delivery to surgeons and unparalleled efficiency to our sales force."
    Mr. Lukianov continued, "Our exclusive sales force continues to gain momentum incorporating our full product line into their territories and achieving deeper penetration into hospitals. We continue to believe the combination of this strengthened sales force and our focus on developing innovative products will translate into robust long-term revenue growth."
    The Gradient Plus(TM) Cervical Plate System was launched in March of 2006 and offers maximum intraoperative flexibility by providing surgeons with a choice of fixed, semi-constrained and dynamic constructs in one system. Together with the product releases announced today and the releases scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2006, this will complete the Company's nine planned product launches for 2006.
    NuVasive will have all aforementioned products on display during its participation in the North American Spine Society's (NASS) 21st Annual Meeting at the Washington State Convention Center in Seattle, WA from September 26, 2006 to September 30, 2006. NuVasive's booth number at NASS is #1830.
    About NuVasive
    NuVasive is a medical device company focused on the design, development and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. The Company's product portfolio is focused on applications in the over $2.9 billion U.S. spine fusion market. The Company's current principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS(TM), as well as classic fusion implants.
    The MAS platform offers advantages for both patients and surgeons such as reduced surgery and hospitalization time and faster recovery. MAS combines three categories of current product offerings -- NeuroVision(R), a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance system; MaXcess(R), a unique split-blade design retraction system; and specialized implants, like SpheRx(R) and CoRoent(R) -- that collectively minimize soft tissue disruption during spine surgery while allowing maximum visualization and surgical reproducibility. NuVasive's classic fusion portfolio is comprised predominantly of proprietary saline packaged bone allografts and internal fixation products. NuVasive also has a robust R&D pipeline emphasizing both MAS and motion preservation products.
    NuVasive cautions you that statements included in this press release that are not a description of historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors which, if they do not materialize or prove correct, could cause NuVasive's results to differ materially from historical results or those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual growth and results to differ materially include, but are not limited to: the risk that NuVasive's revenue projections may turn out to be incorrect because of unanticipated difficulty in selling products; the uncertain process of seeking regulatory approval or clearance for NuVasive's products or devices, including risks that such process could be significantly delayed; the possibility that the FDA may require significant changes to NuVasive's products or clinical studies; the risk that products may not perform as intended and may therefore not achieve commercial success; the risk that competitors may develop superior products or may have a greater market position enabling more successful commercialization; the risk that additional clinical data may call into question the benefits of NuVasive's products to patients, hospitals  and surgeons; and other risks and uncertainties more fully described in NuVasive's press releases and periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Innovation And Execution A Powerful Combination For NuVasive - NuVasive, Inc. (NASDAQ:NUVA) | Seeking Alpha 
Sign in / Join NowGO»
Stephen Simpson, CFALong only, growth at reasonable price, value, research analystInnovation And Execution A Powerful Combination For NuVasiveNuVasive (NASDAQ:NUVA) is a case in point as to why I'm a little cautious sometimes stepping away from strong growth stories driven by innovation and strong operational execution, particularly in markets/sectors that don't always have as much of those as they should. While NuVasive had a great run going into my last write-up in October, and did offer investors a brief pull-back, the shares have since climbed another 20% or so on the back of respectable financial performance and strong "in the field" innovation. Valuation remains problematic. NuVasive is a relatively rare combination of good growth, strong margin leverage, and expanding market share, and I'm not surprised that it has become a popular go-to name in the space.

NuVasive, Inc., based in San Diego, California, is a medical device company focused on the design, development, and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders.[1] NuVasive is a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUVA.
NuVasive’s product portfolio is focused on applications in the over $4.2 billion U.S. spine fusion market. The Company's current principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS, as well as a growing offering of cervical and motion preservation products.
MAS combines three categories of NuVasive’s current product offerings: NeuroVision, a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance system; MaXcess, a unique split-blade design retraction system; and specialized implants. The MAS platform enables procedures such as XLIF, or eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, a minimally disruptive spine surgery that accesses the spine through the patient’s side. This procedure is a more modern surgical option for treatment of scoliosis than the Harrington Rod, which is no longer used.

NuVasive, Inc., based in San Diego, California, is a medical device company focused on the design, development, and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders.[1] NuVasive is a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol NUVA.
NuVasive’s product portfolio is focused on applications in the over $4.2 billion U.S. spine fusion market. The Company's current principal product offering includes a minimally disruptive surgical platform called Maximum Access Surgery, or MAS, as well as a growing offering of cervical and motion preservation products.
MAS combines three categories of NuVasive’s current product offerings: NeuroVision, a proprietary software-driven nerve avoidance system; MaXcess, a unique split-blade design retraction system; and specialized implants. The MAS platform enables procedures such as XLIF, or eXtreme Lateral Interbody Fusion, a minimally disruptive spine surgery that accesses the spine through the patient’s side. This procedure is a more modern surgical option for treatment of scoliosis than the Harrington Rod, which is no longer used.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
