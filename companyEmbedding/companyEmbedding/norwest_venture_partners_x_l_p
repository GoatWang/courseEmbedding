The more engaging they can be w/ audiences, the better —@seancaptain #MediaTalkTech  What Entrepreneurs Are Saying Promod Haque and Norwest Venture Partners provided exceptional support during a fairly long product gestation and initial market fit exercise during the early period of FireEye’s business evolution. They showed fortitude as an investor and believed in the eventual opportunity to defend the world from advanced cyber attacks even when there were insufficient market proof points. I am grateful for their support in helping build FireEye into the global company it is today. Ashar Aziz, Founder, Vice Chairman of the Board, and Chief Strategy Officer - FireEye Norwest’s ability to invest against the grain in an enterprise mobility company like MobileIron speaks to the firm’s belief in its entrepreneurs and backing companies in new markets that aren’t yet obvious. MobileIron is a great example of how Norwest partners with companies to build great businesses. Bob Tinker, President & CEO - MobileIron As we built out our sales force across the United States and grew our sales over 3000% from commercialization to IPO, Norwest’s financing and guidance was critical to our success. Their partnership was and remains key during our rapid commercial growth and scaling. We would not be where we are today without them. Lisa Earnhardt, President and CEO - Intersect ENT Norwest has been championing our team since before day one. Along with Alagu, I was an Entrepreneur- in-Residence with Norwest. I know firsthand how the firm supports companies from idea to incubation to launch to growth and beyond. Matt Howard has been a tremendous part of this path for us at Blue Jeans and is available to us 24×7. Matt has brokered strategic relationships, including those that have led directly to revenue.

        Unexpected Surprise!
Because I was not satisfied with the Samsung J7 for some reasons, I searched reviews for other cells. I, then, fascinated at the ad and reviews of X Ventura. I got it , and I have found it super!  It is much more than I expected, really.  Cool design, strong grip, good feeling back surface with non-slippery material for the best safety, good deal of storage, super camera, etc.  It is way over the price. I told my wife, "This is best I've had." Thanks LG guys!

        Replacement for Samsung,
Love he ease of all the security features, not too much.  Fingerprint and knock code are the best.  Quick button to check my walking is a plus as well as the weather/compass.  I needed a more rugged phone for my walking, so far holding up though I have not dropped it.  Caught out in rain so far so good on that feature as well.  Battery lasts a whole day even with moderate use.  I have small hands and still phone feels comfortable holding and using the phone.

I am extremely happy with this phone. There is not one thing I have found to be a problem with it. The price is a fraction of the big name smart phones and yet it does everything I need it to do. The battery life is amazing. IP68 water & dust resistance and a 4,100mAh battery. The phone has passed 14 military standard tests. There is even a glove mode to increase the touch screen sensitivity.

        Great headset! Nice features!  But why so small???
I want to be clear.... I love this headset! The sound, the speaker phone and battery life etc.... but this is way to small. I feel like Lg but too much thought in to this one. Is should have some kind of extension or something. Im 6'1 220 and pretty fit. But this barely fits around my neck and the cords are short as well. I know its for working out but this headset is definitely not one size fits all. It sad because other than that. I love this headset. So if you have a skinny neck....this headset is for you"

I have used many different styles of headsets in my 58 years. After the 3rd day of using these I can say they are the best yet. LG has a great piece of hardware here. Easy to use and comfortable to wear. No long charge time. Distance of up to about 50 feet in range from my PC (Windows 10). I use it mostly at night as to not bother those sleeping at night. The Voice Prompts are a really nice feature. Great job LG! Life IS Good!

            Is the device more compatible with certain brands? I have a Samsung and an IPhone. It will randomly disconnects from iPhone.
        


Asked by: DDWLVP702

            The headset is not manufactured to work better with Samsung over IPhone. The compatibility of the headset would vary based upon the device to which it is connected.

            Why if iwill call and using the external speaker only right speaker will on the other speaker not working during a call mode?
        


Asked by: Michaella

            If you read the manual you would see it is supposed to be that way: only one speaker works for calls. There's nothing wrong with your headset and you can't change it.

        Amazing Watch.
I absolutely love this watch. Some people complain about the size of it. I however think it's the perfect size and it's fantastic in every way possible. I've been nothing but happy with it.

        Works Great on T-Mobile
I have had this watch for a few months now and I love it.. It is pretty awesome when my phone runs out of battery that I can make calls, use "ok google" to search for stuff, get navigation, etc. I have found this watch to be a great reminder/notification device to keep me on top of things while in work mode. The design is simple and clean and everything on it works pretty well. Sometimes it takes a moment for it to connect to the network which can be annoying but that is because its paired with the phone. When it isn't paired with the phone it usually works faster guessing because its not trying to decide which signal to use. Anyway its a great smart watch that IMHO has helped me be more productive and safer while driving or riding my motorcycle.

        What a Waste of My Money
I've tried everything to get better battery life and the only way I cam make it through the day is to turn all of the radios off, including LTE which is the primary reason I bought the LG Watch Sport.

        Excellent Smartwatch
I really enjoy this watch. It is my first smartwatch. I have been waiting for years now to get a watch with all these features combined with the new Android 2.0 experience. Despite what others have said, my battery lasts me all day. I have cellular service but keep it turned off when I don't need it. I keep wifi on, bluetooth on, NFC on, location on, gestures off, and tilt to wake on. I also never use the always on feature. I usually don't drop under 25% batter after 18 hours use. LG, I really enjoy the watch faces you provided with this watch. In fact I enjoy them more than almost all 3rd party watch faces available right now (probably because most watch faces don't take advantage of the new Android Wear 2.0 API yet). Even still, I wish you would keep adding more.

        Great watch except for battery
Let me start by saying I am still very happy with this purchase.  I was only looking for a fitness tracker that had built in GPS, an interval timer for running, and storage for my music.  All so I could run and workout at the gym without my phone.  This was the closest I could get to that and am fairly happy with all the features.  Google Fit works really well and has so much potential and I'm confident they'll continue to enhance it.

All that said, the battery life is AWFUL!!!!  I went to the gym yesterday at 65% with AOD, Cellular, Wi-Fi and NFC all off.  The only thing I was running was BT for my headset, Google Play Music from downloaded music, and Google Fit to track my Weight Training Workout.  The phone powered off at 0% battery within the hour.  Unacceptable.  Why offer these features if you can't even get a full workout in?

I love this watch, and will continue to push it to its limits, but LG - you HAVE to do something to manage battery life better on this device.

        Nice phone
I bought the watch 5 days ago and recieved it 3 days ago, because the AT&T store was out of them. The watch looks good and works fine. The features are good and there are a few apps that can be added. I would think more apps would come out in the future. 
The only draw back it the battery. It last about 12 hours when apps are not used to much. The more the apps are uses or calls or texts are made the quicker the battery dies. LG needs to address this issue.

        Lg needs to work on it
First, you don't find 1 app compatible form LG.  Lg needs to make more apps for this watch, like new faces and apps for setting.  Second, you don't find no more than 1 accessory beside than charge. how you make a product in this days without no accessory, come LG you need to catch up.  However, i like watch because it is well made.

            Can I buy a SmartWatch in USA and use it in Denmark with the Lte???
        


Asked by: Tobias jensen

            The LG Watch Sport&trade; - AT&amp;T, Model # W280A is designed to run on AT&amp;T's GSM 850/1900 MHz; LTE Bands 2/4/5. If the carrier in Denmark runs on those same ferquencies and LTE bands, it should work. You will need to check with the carrier in Denmark that you intend to use it with for compatibility. Carriers decide which devices they allow to run on their networks...^IFV

            can the lg watch sport work with Sprint?
        


Asked by: lil bill03

            Yes!!...Most people don't know that the AT&amp;T model w280a is compatible with Verizon and Sprint CDMA Networks.  I'm currently using my w280a model on Verizon right now.  The hardest part is to get Verizon to issue you a SIM card for a non-Verizon product.  Verizon will be reluctant to do this, because it's not company policy.  I had to go through a long frustrating process, but I was able to get it done.

            From other answers it appears this watch is not SIM locked to AT&amp;T.
Is that correct?
        


Asked by: LAgeek

            Now in English/Simpler terms...The LG watch sport model W280a is the AT&amp;T model &amp; is intended to used on the AT&amp;T GSM network.  But most people dont know that model W280a can also be used on Verizon &amp; Sprint CDMA Networks.  I'm currently using my W280a model on Verizon right now.  The only problem was getting Verizon to program a SIM Card to be used in a non-Verizon product.  Verizon typically doesn't like to do this cause it's not company policy.  But I was persistent (but not disrespectful) so I eventually got it done, but it was a long frustrating process.

            Do you have to have a SIM card for it to work or can I just buy it and not have the Sims I just want to watch itself I don't want nothing else beside to watch
        


Asked by: Motokiller

            You don't have to use the SIM Card for cellular service if you don't want to (it's an additional monthly cost on your phone bill).  Just pay for that watch in full but don't activate the SIM Card. You can still use the watch as a regular smart watch without the cellular service.

            How waterproof are we talking here, can I shower with it?   I love this little watch!
        


Asked by: tanas89

            The correct answer to this question is nope.  It's wet rating just means you can't sweat this watch to death, you can kill it with a shower though.  At present only the Pebble smart watch (which ahs been discontinued) and the Apple Watch II are the only 2 for sure swim proof watches.  Garmen makes a couple you could shower with too but they're God awful ugly things.
