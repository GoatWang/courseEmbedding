Technology | ClearVue PV - Energy Generating Clear Glass

Technology

ClearVue’s patented advanced glazing technology sits within an activated interlayer sandwiched between two panes of glass.
Through the combination of special compound materials, the interlayer prevents heat and unwanted solar radiation (UV or Infrared) from penetrating the glass pane.  This energy is then redirected to the edge of the glass for controlled distribution and harvesting through conventional PV solar cells, whilst allowing the natural visible wavelength light to pass through largely unaltered.
ClearVue believes its Patented DEFLECTIVE Technology has the potential to revolutionise the glazing industry globally, and provide a new generation in energy-efficient glazing for commercial buildings, housing, greenhouses and automobiles, Internet of Things applications and mobile device screens.
Currently in final testing of northern and southern hemisphere weather conditions, ClearVue has exceeded all scientific testing requirements and is looking to commercialise a product range suitable for commercial distribution in 2017.

Product qualities include

Energy Produced – up to 40 watts per sqm depending on type of frame used
IR & UV Control – approx 90%
Insulation properties – Saves heating and cooling costs through superior insulation
Transparency – >75%, lets most of the natural light through the window
Pay back – the glass window will provide a payback to the building over time

 
“Our Dream is to have a zero net energy building” – Victor Rosenberg, Chairman & Founder of ClearVue Technologies Ltd.

Mr. Victor Rosenberg, Executive Chairman of ClearVue Technologies Ltd advised the market that ClearVue has made significant progress in the manufacturing and distribution capacity over the last 3 months.







Importantly, the product is now of a size where we can now start to target specific sales pipelines.
“Our market entry strategy will target public infrastructure such as Bus Shelters, glass walls and similar public areas to highlight the true value of our technology. Importantly the size of our glass has increased without loss of power generation.”

Mr. Rosenberg concluded by saying “we are now in discussions with a number of organisations where our technology complements existing marketing and communications strategies such as public advertising. We look forward to advising the market of our progress in due course.”
Overleaf is an example of the new range of glass product.

ClearVue’s Vision

At ClearVue Technologies, we see a world where consumers are part of the energy solution.
Download our latest product brochure here: ClearVuePV Brochure
ClearVue Technologies is a disruptive technology where the consumers of energy are both the demand side and the supply side of their energy needs.  Our mission is to enable consumers of energy the ability to generate their own electricity to power their own homes, businesses, greenhouses and cars from one of the world’s most common building materials, glass.
Through our patented nano-technology, an activated interlayer sits within two panes of glass and redirects infra-red and ultraviolet light to the side of a window to harvest the solar energy with traditional PV elements.

ClearVue Technologies is at the forefront of an energy and architectural design revolution that we believe will address in part society’s future energy demands for a clean, sustainable and renewable energy solution.

ClearVue Technologies clear glass products provide:

Clean, renewable power from a window
Superior insulation qualities that reduces heating and cooling costs
High transparency to let greater than 75% of natural light through the glass
Provides genuine payback on your investment
Long product life of 30 plus years, and
Acts as safety glass

Imagine windows that help produce the energy needs for your residential home
ClearVue has the potential to have a meangful impact on the energy bill of a home.  Future products include home windows through to skylights.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Imagine windows that help produce energy to power your business
Given the superior insulation properties of ClearVue glass, our findings suggest that not only will the ClearVue advance glazing produce electicity for commercial buildings, but deliver significant cost savings through a reduction in the heating and cooling costs associated with a building.
