                    Riverside is a very diverse city that offers many different types of lifestyles. These neighborhoods are what allows us to meet the unique living environments of its residents. You know what is great? I can drive down one set of neighborhoods to find brand new homes or find homes from the 1920¿s just a block or two away.

If you are looking to move to Riverside, as a new resident, or long-time resident, contact me to learn all about Riverside neighborhoods and the great things they can offer. It is the largest,smallest community you will ever live in.

                    I've lived in Riverside for 18 years and as vast as it is it always amazes me how it's really like a small town. You will always meet someone and inevitably have similar friends or contacts in common. I love this about this area...not to mention the various neighborhoods that have their own characteristics. For instance, the Wood Streets is a lovely area of Riverside know for it's charming older homes and quaint streets. Drive through this area during Christmas or Halloween and you are sure to have a lot of fun viewing all the decorated homes. There's also the ever changing and growing downtown area. This area is transforming and becoming a great place if you like being in the hub of the action. Riverside...a big city with a small town feel.

                    Downtown Riverside is the Heart of the City with many cultural and historic locations, not to mention the University of Riverside.  Homes range from Spanish Colonial Revival, Mission Revival, California Bungalows to modern new built homes.  The Mission Inn is probably the most famous location in Riverside and during the holidays is decorated with millions of lights.  It's a great event when the lights are turned on and a wonderful place to start your holiday festivities.  Orchards, parks and shopping abound.  You'll never lack for something to do.
