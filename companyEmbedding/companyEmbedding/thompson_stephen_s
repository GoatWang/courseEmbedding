• MMA Pro since 2010• Seven wins by KO, one by submission (RNC)• Owns a combined 57-0 kickboxing record, which includes over 40 KOs• Brother-in-law is Carlos Machado• Has trained with Anderson Silva, Chris Weidman, Georges St-Pierre, Rashad Evans, Nate Marquardt, and Keith Jardine• Five first round finishes• Origin of nickname: “It came when I was 15. I fought a guy that was in his early to mid twenties and held a couple state kickboxing titles. He was undefeated also. I put a beating on him that totally baffled people, as it was my first fight. My dad threw my in DEEP. He wanted to see if this was what I REALLY wanted to do. After the fight the guy I beat was totally demoralized that he got essentially spanked by a 15-year-old in his first fight and made the comment "I wonder why I got in the ring with that boy." So the commentator heard this and called me Wonderboy. Also when I was a younger kid I'd sing and dance and my sister’s then boyfriend would call me Stevie Wonder so somehow all this turned into Wonderboy. Yeah, kinda crazy.”
