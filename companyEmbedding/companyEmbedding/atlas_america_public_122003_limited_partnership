Atlas Travel® Insurance 
Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Pre-existing conditions — charges resulting directly or indirectly from any pre-existing condition, as herein defined, are excluded from this insurance unless it is a sudden and unexpected outbreak or recurrence that is of short duration and requires urgent care. Under Atlas Travel®, no coverage is available for known, scheduled, required, or expected medical care, drugs, or treatments existent or necessary prior to the effective date of coverage.
Routine medical examinations
Routine pre-natal care, pregnancy, child birth, and post-natal care

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?
For non-U.S. citizens or residents whose travel does not include the U.S. or U.S. territories, the maximum coverage duration is 365 days. Additionally, coverage may be renewed up to 2 additional coverage periods. Coverage renewal requires satisfaction of a new deductible and coinsurance. Renewals may be filed through the Client Zone.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with ("item 8:Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"), which contains our financial statements.  The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Atlas America Public #12-2003 Limited Partnership ("we", "us", or "the Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on July 15, 2003 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its managing general partner and operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resources Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its ultimate parent company, Atlas Energy ("Atlas Energy") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ATLS, +12.38%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         for administrative services.  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  - Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  - Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  - Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose. The MGP is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices, the natural decline in well production, and current future plugging services and costs.  MARKETS AND COMPETITION  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Natural Gas. We market the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market our gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, and Transco Leidy Line.  We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.  Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  Natural Gas Liquids. NGL's are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as mentioned above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, Chevron Natural Gas accounted for approximately 72% of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% for this period.  GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.  The areas in which we operate are experiencing a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production related to new and increased drilling for deeper natural gas formations and the implementation of new exploration and production techniques, including horizontal and multiple fracturing techniques. The increase in the supply of natural gas has put a downward pressure on domestic natural gas prices. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas and oil reserves.  Our future production, cash flow, and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, including the MGP, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas and oil prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas production from particular wells decreases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  GAS AND OIL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:   Years Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,157 $ 1,101 Oil 104 99 Liquids 11 13 Total $ 1,272 $ 1,213 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) 826 995 Oil (bbls/day) 3 3 Liquids (bbls/day) 1 1 Total (mcfe/day) 850 1,019 Average sales price: (1) Gas (per mcf) (2) $ 4.04 $ 3.34 Oil (per bbl) $ 95.97 $ 96.97 Liquids (per bbl) $ 50.88 $ 35.37 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 81 % 94 % Per mcfe $ 3.31 $ 3.07 Depletion per mcfe $ 2.38 $ 1.82  (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $60,400 and $116,100 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $1,156,900 and $1,100,500 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $56,400 (5%). The $56,400 increase in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $245,900 increase in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, partially offset by a $189,500 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 826 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 995 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease of 169 (17%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (See Item 1 "Business-Contractual Revenue Arrangements"). Thus, the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions. The decrease in production volume is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $104,400 and $99,100 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, an increase of $5,300 (5%). The $5,300 increase in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $6,400 increase in production volumes, partially offset by a $1,100 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes increase to 2.98 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2013 from 2.79 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2012, an increase of 0.19 bbl per day (7%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $10,700 and $12,900 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $2,200 (17%). The $2,200 decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year period was attributable to a $5,400 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $3,200 increase in liquid prices. Our production volumes were 0.57 and 0.99 bbls per day for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of 0.42 (42%) bbls per day.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $1,024,500 and $1,143,700 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $119,200 (10%). This decrease was primarily due to a combination of a decrease in supervision fees and a decrease in well maintenance and repairs.  Depletion of our oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 58% and 56% for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes were directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices, production volumes and changes in the cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses were $198,800 and $225,200 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $26,400 (12%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the timing of the costs and services provided to us.  There was no impairment of oil and gas properties for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. Annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed oil and gas producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, no impairment charges were recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.  Liquidity and Capital Resources. Cash provided by operating activities decreased $114,200 for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $2,500 as compared to $116,700 the year ended December 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in a non-cash loss on derivative values of $55,600, and a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $277,400, partially offset by an increase in the change in accrued liabilities of $13,800, and an increase in net earnings before depletion, asset impairment and accretion of $205,100.  Cash provided by investing activities was $3,100 during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulting from the net of $8,800 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $5,700 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $173,800 for the year ended December 31, 2013. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. The MGP is currently evaluating its right to exercise this option based on several factors such as commodity prices, the natural decline in well production, and current future plugging services and costs. Through December 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Asset Impairment  There were no asset impairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.  ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION  Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1:  Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that there will be continuing changes. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on activities, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants, generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have naturally occurring radioactivity, and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.  CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION  Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.  Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, asset impairment, fair value of derivative instruments, and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements included in ("item 8:Financial Statements") included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.  Depletion and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  Long-Lived Assets. The cost of natural gas and oil properties, less estimated salvage value, is generally depleted on the units-of-production method.  Natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. The undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions, including natural gas and oil prices, production and operating expenses. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook within this section, recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.  There were no impairments of proved gas and oil properties recorded by us for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012.  Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  We have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.  Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques.  We use a fair value methodology to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts. Our commodity hedges are calculated based on observable market data related to the change in price of the underlying commodity and are therefore defined as Level 2 fair value measurements.  Liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include our asset retirement obligations ("ARO") that are defined as Level  Reserve Estimates  Our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions, including those required by the SEC, as to natural gas and oil prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates. We engaged Wright and Company, Inc., an independent third-party reserve engineer, to prepare a report of our proved reserves (see "item 2:Properties").  Any significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves. As a result, our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas and oil prices, revenues, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay distributions. In addition, our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, prevailing natural gas and oil prices, mechanical difficulties, governmental regulation and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of oil and gas properties. Generally, an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense.  Asset Retirement Obligations  We recognize and estimate the liability for the plugging and abandonment of our gas and oil wells. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset.  The estimated liability is based on our historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates, external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using our MGP's assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells, or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements. We have no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Except for our gas and oil properties, we believe that there are no other material retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets.  Working Interest  Our Partnership Agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to our MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions ("working interest"). Our MGP is also . . .  Mar 31, 2014  (c) 1995-2014 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  General  Atlas America Public #12-2003 Limited Partnership ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on July 15, 2003 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resource Partners, L.P. ("ARP") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    ARP, +0.00%
 On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; NYSE: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of ARP's general partner interest.  We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services.  We intend to continue to produce our wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:  ? well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;  ? reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and  ? preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of June 30, 2015, our MGP withheld $456,700 of net production revenues for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2014 and the first six months of 2015, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2015 2014 2015 2014 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 88 $ 367 $ 240 $ 673 Oil 11 20 18 32 Liquid 1 7 4 11 Total $ 100 $ 394 $ 262 $ 716 Production volumes: Gas (Mcf/day) (1) 691 873 709 767 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 2 2 2 2 Liquid (bbl/day) (1) 1 1 1 1 Total (Mcfe/day) (1) 709 891 727 785 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per Mcf) (1) (3) $ 1.40 $ 4.66 $ 1.87 $ 4.89 Oil (per bbl) (1) $ 48.37 $ 94.67 $ 47.45 $ 93.27 Liquid per (bbl/day) (1) $ 22.48 $ 56.91 $ 30.49 $ 55.18 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 170 % 61 % 145 % 65 % Per Mcfe (1) 2.63 $ 2.97 $ 2.90 $ 3.28 Depletion per Mcfe $ 0.34 $ 0.53 $ 0.34 $ 0.54  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "Mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to Mcfe using the ratio of six Mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $3,500 and $4,800 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $87,900 and $367,100 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $279,200 (76%). The $279,200 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $202,600 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $76,600 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 691 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 873 Mcf per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 182 Mcf per day (21%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in due to a decline in natural gas prices.  Our natural gas revenues were $240,400 and $673,500 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $433,100 (64%). The $433,100 decrease in natural gas revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $382,800 decrease in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $50,300 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 709 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 767 Mcf per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, a decrease of 58 Mcf per day (8%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well and a decrease in the number of producing wells due to wells shut-in due to a decline in natural gas prices.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $10,900 and $20,400 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $9,500 (47%). The $9,500 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $10,400 decrease in oil prices, partially offset by a $900 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 2.48 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2015 from 2.36 bbls per day for the three months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 0.12 bbls per day (4%).  Our oil revenues were $18,100 and $31,900 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $13,800 (43%). The $13,800 decrease in oil revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $17,500 decrease in oil prices, partially offset by a $3,700 increase in production volumes. Our production volumes increased to 2.11 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2015 from 1.89 bbls per day for the six months ended June 30, 2014, an increase of 0.22 bbls per day (12%).  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $1,200 and $6,300 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $3,700 and $10,900 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $170,000 and $241,600 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $71,600 (30%). Production expenses were $381,200 and $465,600 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $84,400 (18%). The decreases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period were mostly due to decreases in transportation fees due to a decrease in revenue.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 22% and 11% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and 17% and 11% for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were $40,800 and $40,000, respectively, an increase of $800 (2%). For the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, these expenses were $89,900 and $87,600, respectively, an increase of $2,300 (3%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The increases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to the prior year similar period are primarily due to third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $117,700 to $0 in the six months ended June 30, 2015 as compared to $117,700 for the six months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was mostly due to a decrease in net (loss) income before depletion and accretion of $371,800, a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $73,600, a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $68,200, a decrease in the non-cash (gain) loss on hedge instruments of $6,800, and a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $1,200. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $403,900 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through June 30, 2015, our MGP has withheld $456,700 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

ATLAS AMERICA PUBLIC #12-2003 LIMITED PARTNERSHIP - 10-K - : MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONSThe discussion and analysis presented below provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, which contains our financial statements.
The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements were made. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected or implied in the forward-looking statements. We believe the assumptions underlying the financial statements are reasonable. However, our financial statements included herein may not necessarily reflect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Atlas America Public #12-2003 Limited Partnership ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership and formed on July 15, 2003 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or the "MGP"). Atlas Resources is an indirect subsidiary of Atlas Resources Partners, L.P. ("ARP") (NYSE: ARP).
On February 27, 2015, the MGP's ultimate parent, Atlas Energy, L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), which was a publicly traded master-limited partnership, was acquired by Targa Resources Corp. and distributed to Atlas Energy's unitholders 100% of the limited liability company interests in ARP's general partner, Atlas Energy Group, LLC ("Atlas Energy Group"; OTCQX: ATLS). Atlas Energy Group became a separate, publicly traded company and the ultimate parent of the MGP as a result of the distribution. Following the distribution, Atlas Energy Group continues to manage ARP's operations and activities through its ownership of the ARP's general partner interest.



                                       21


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Partnership has drilled and currently operates wells located in Pennsylvania. The Partnership has no employees and relies on the MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy Group (February 27, 2015 and prior, Atlas Energy), for administrative services. (See Item 11: "Executive Compensation").
The Partnership's operating cash flows are generated from its wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. The Partnership intends to produce its wells until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. The Partnership does not expect to drill additional wells and expects no additional funds will be required for drilling.
The economic viability of the Partnership's production is based on a variety of factors including proved developed reserves that it can expect to recover through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of additional required extraction equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well; and through currently installed extraction equipment and related infrastructure which is operational at the time of the reserves estimate (if the extraction is by means not involving drilling, completing or reworking a well). There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven reserves and in projecting future net revenues.
The prices at which the Partnership's natural gas and oil will be sold are uncertain and the Partnership is not guaranteed a specific natural gas price for the sale of its natural gas production. Changes in natural gas and oil prices have a significant impact on the Partnership's cash flow and the value of its reserves. Lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease the Partnership's revenues, but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the Partnership can produce economically.
Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which primarily produce natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated and/or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:


  ? Well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;


     ?  Reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate
        books and records; and


  ? Preparation of reports for us and government agencies.



The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for service performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of December 31, 2015, our MGP withheld $721,200 of net production revenue for this purpose.


                                       22



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MARKETS AND COMPETITION
The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in gas and oil producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2015 and 2014, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competing in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.
Natural Gas. The MGP markets the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The production area and pricing indices for the Appalachian Basin are Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline, Transco Leidy Line, Columbia Appalachia, NYMEX and Transco Zone 5.
We do not hold firm transportation obligations on any pipeline that requires payment of transportation fees regardless of natural gas production volumes. As is customary in certain of our other operating areas, we occasionally commit a predictable portion of monthly production to the purchaser in order to maintain a gathering agreement.
Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting for an oil company. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining "dry" gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting dry natural gas is sold as described above and our NGLs are generally priced using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a volumetric retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
For the year ended December 31, 2015, Chevron Natural Gas accounted for approximately 74% of our total natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues for this period.
GENERAL TRENDS AND OUTLOOK
We expect our business to be affected by the following key trends. Our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us. To the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from our expected results.
The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The causes of these declines are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, a significant increase in natural gas, oil and NGL production. While we anticipate continued high levels of exploration and production activities over the long-term in the areas in which we operate, fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect production rates and investments in the development of new natural gas, oil and NGL reserves.
Our future gas and oil reserves, production, cash flow, our ability to make distributions to our unitholders, depend on our success in producing our current reserves efficiently. We face the challenge of natural production declines and volatile natural gas, oil and NGL prices. As initial reservoir pressures are depleted, natural gas and oil production from particular wells decreases.



                                       23

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
GAS, OIL AND NGL PRODUCTION: The following table sets forth information related to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated:

                                                Years Ended December 31,
                                                 2015               2014
         Production revenues (in thousands):
         Gas                                 $        357       $        987
         Oil                                           29                 60
         Liquids                                        6                 20

         Oil (per bbl)                       $      46.61       $      89.96
         Liquids (per bbl)                   $      22.44       $      50.94

         Production costs:
         As a percent of revenues                     171 %               84 %
         Per mcfe                            $       2.71       $       3.09
         Depletion per mcfe                  $       0.25       $       1.10





       (1) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after reversing
           the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period
           impairment charges.


       (2) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue
           derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with
           prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for
           the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $9,800 for the
           year ended December 31, 2014.


Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $357,600 and $987,400 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $629,800 (64%). The $629,800 decrease in natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to a $483,100 decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of financial hedges, which were driven by market conditions, and a $146,700 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 665 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 782 mcf per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 117 (15%) mcf per day. The price we receive for our natural gas is primarily a result of the index driven agreements (See Item 1: "Business-Contractual Revenue Arrangements"). Thus, the price we receive for our natural gas may vary significantly each month as the underlying index changes in response to market conditions. The decrease in production volume is mostly due to the normal decline inherent in the life of the wells in addition to wells shut-in due to it being uneconomical to continue production in the current pricing environment.
Oil Revenues. We drilled wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $28,800 and $59,700 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $30,900 (52%). The $30,900 decrease in oil revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to $26,800 decrease in oil prices and a $4,100 decrease in production volumes. Our production volumes decreased to 1.69 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2015 from 1.82 bbls per day for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.13 bbls per day (7%).



                                       24


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquids revenues were $5,700 and $20,200 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $14,500 (72%). The $14,500 decrease in liquid revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the prior year was attributable to $7,200 decrease in production volumes and a $7,300 decrease in prices. Our production volumes were 0.70 bbls and 1.09 bbls per day for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of 0.39 (36%) bbls per day.
Gain on Mark-to-Market Derivatives. On January 1, 2015, we discontinued hedge accounting for our qualified commodity derivatives. As such, subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized immediately within gain on mark-to-market derivatives on our statements of operations. The fair values of these commodity derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014, which were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income within partners' capital on our balance sheet, will be reclassified to our statements of operations in the future at the time the originally hedged physical transactions settle.
We recognized a gain on mark-to-market derivatives of $18,100 for the year ended December 31, 2015. This gain was due primarily to mark-to-market gains in the current year primarily related to the change in natural gas prices during the year. There were no gains or losses on mark-to-market derivatives during the year ended December 31, 2014.
Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $672,200 and $899,900 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $227,700 (25%). This decrease was primarily due to decreases in supervision fees, transportation fees and water hauling expenses.
Depletion of our gas and oil properties as a percentage of gas and oil revenues was 16% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. This change was primarily attributable to changes in gas and oil reserve quantities, and to a lesser extent, revenues, product prices, production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of gas and oil properties.
General and administrative expenses were $168,000 and $181,100 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, a decrease of $13,100 (7%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP and vary from period to period due to the timing of the costs and services provided to us.
Impairment of gas and oil properties for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $716,100 and $2,770,000, respectively. At least annually, we compare the carrying value of our proved developed gas and oil producing properties to their estimated fair market value. To the extent our carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value, an impairment charge is recognized. As a result of this assessment, an impairment charge was recognized for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. This charge is based on reserve quantities, future market prices and our carrying value. We cannot provide any assurance that similar charges may or may not be taken in future periods.
Liquidity and Capital Resources. We are generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flow from our operations to fund our obligations and make distributions to our partners.
The natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids commodity price markets have suffered significant declines during the fourth quarter of 2014 and throughout 2015. The extreme ongoing volatility in the energy industry and commodity prices will likely continue to impact our outlook. We have experienced downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values due to the significant declines in commodity prices. Our MGP continues to implement various cost saving measures to reduce our operating and general and administrative costs, including renegotiating contracts with contractors, suppliers and service providers, reducing the number of staff and contractors and deferring and eliminating discretionary costs. Our MGP will continue to be opportunistic and aggressive in managing our cost structure and, in turn, our liquidity to meet our operating needs. To the extent commodity prices remain low or decline further, or we experience other disruptions in the industry, our ability to fund our operations and make distributions may be further impacted, and could result in the MGP's decision to liquidate our operations.



                                       25


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from the MGP to fund operations as the cash flow from our operations has been adequate to fund our obligations and distributions to our partners. However, the recent significant declines in commodity prices have challenged our ability to fund our operations and may make it uneconomical to produce our wells until they are depleted as we originally intended. Accordingly, the MGP determined that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The MGP intends, as necessary, to continue our operations and to fund our obligations for at least the next twelve months. The MGP has concluded that such undertaking is sufficient to alleviate the doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
If, however, the MGP were to decide to liquidate our operations, the liquidation valuation of the Partnership's assets and liabilities would be determined by an independent expert. It is possible that based on such determination, we would not be able to make any liquidation distributions to our limited partners. A liquidation could result in the transfer of the post-liquidation assets and liabilities of the Partnership to the MGP and would occur without any further contributions from or distributions to the limited partners.
Cash provided by operating activities decreased $5,600 for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $0 as compared to $5,600 of cash used by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014. This decrease in cash used by operating activities was due to a decrease in net loss before depletion, impairment, and accretion of $416,300, a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate of $265,000, a decrease in the change in asset retirement receivable-affiliate of $72,800, and a decrease in the non-cash loss on derivative value of $22,600. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the change in accounts payable trade-affiliate of $780,400 and a decrease in the change in accrued liabilities of $1,900 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.
Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Through December 31, 2015, our MGP withheld $721,200 of funds for this purpose. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow at any one time may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.
Impairment
During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $716,100 and $2,770,000, respectively, of impairment related to gas and oil properties within property, plant, and equipment on our balance sheet. These impairments relate to the carrying amount of our gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the release of regulated materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or human health or safety (see "Item 1: Business -Environmental Matters and Regulation"). We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties; imposition of remedial requirements; issuance of injunctions affecting our operations; or other measures. We have maintained and expect to continue to maintain environmental compliance programs. However, risks of accidental leaks or spills are associated with our operations. There can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities relating to claims for damages to property, the environment, natural resources, or persons resulting from the operation of our business. Moreover, it is possible other developments, such as increasingly strict federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies, could result in increased costs and liabilities to us.
Environmental laws and regulations have changed substantially and rapidly over the last 25 years, and we anticipate that such changes will continue. Trends in environmental regulation include increased reporting obligations and placing more restrictions and limitations on operations, such as emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants; generation and disposal of wastes, including wastes that may have technologically enhanced naturally occurring radioactive materials; and use, storage and handling of chemical substances that may impact human health, the environment and/or threatened or endangered species. Other increasingly stringent environmental restrictions and limitations have resulted in increased operating costs for us and other similar businesses throughout the United States. It is possible that the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations may continue to increase. We will attempt to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and to plan accordingly, but there can be no assurance that we will identify and properly anticipate each such change, or that our efforts will prevent material costs, if any, from rising.


                                       26



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES IN PRICES AND INFLATION
Our revenues and the value of our assets have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas and oil market prices. Natural gas and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict.
Inflation affects the operating expenses of our operations. Inflationary trends may occur if commodity prices were to increase, since such an increase may cause the demand for energy equipment and services to increase, thereby increasing the costs of acquiring or obtaining such equipment and services. While we anticipate that inflation will affect our future operating costs, we cannot predict the timing or amounts of any such effects.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of actual revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Although we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, actual results may differ from the estimates on which our financial statements are prepared at any given point of time. Changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include revenue and expense accruals, depletion and amortization, impairment, fair value of derivative instruments, and the probability of forecasted transactions. We summarize our significant accounting policies within our financial statements (See "Item 8: Financial Statements") included in this report. The critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified are discussed below.
Depletion and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets
Long-Lived Assets. The cost of natural gas and oil properties, less estimated salvage value, is generally depleted on the units-of-production method.
Natural gas and oil properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. A long-lived asset is considered to be impaired when the undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than its carrying amount. The undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are based upon our estimates that rely on various assumptions, including natural gas and oil prices, production and operating expenses. Any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. As discussed in General Trends and Outlook within this section, recent increases in natural gas drilling have driven an increase in the supply of natural gas and put a downward pressure on domestic prices. Further declines in natural gas prices may result in additional impairment charges in future periods.
Events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the need for impairment testing include, among other factors: operating losses; unused capacity; market value declines; technological developments resulting in obsolescence; changes in demand for products manufactured by others utilizing our services or for our products; changes in competition and competitive practices; uncertainties associated with the United States and world economies; changes in the expected level of environmental capital, operating or remediation expenditures; and changes in governmental regulations or actions.
During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $716,100 and $2,770,000, respectively, of impairment within natural gas and oil properties. These impairments relate to the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties being in excess of our estimate of their fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimate of fair value of these gas and oil properties was impacted by, among other factors, the deterioration of natural gas and oil prices at the date of measurement.
As a result of the recent significant declines in commodity prices and associated recorded impairment charges, remaining net book value of gas and oil properties on our balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was primarily related to the estimated salvage value of such properties. The estimated salvage values were based on our MGP's historical experience in determining such values and were discounted based on the remaining lives of those wells using an assumed credit adjusted risk-free interest rate.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We have established a hierarchy to measure our financial instruments at fair value, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs represent market data obtained from independent sources, whereas unobservable inputs reflect the Partnership's own market assumptions, which are used if observable inputs are not reasonably available without undue cost and effort. The hierarchy defines three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:


                                       27


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.
Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity but rather through particular valuation techniques.



                                       28


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use a fair value methodology to value the assets and liabilities for our outstanding derivative contracts. Our commodity hedges are calculated based on observable market data related to the change in price of the underlying commodity and are therefore defined as Level 2 fair value measurements.
Liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include our asset retirement obligations ("ARO") that are defined as Level 3. Estimates of the fair value of ARO's are based on discounted cash flows using numerous estimates, assumptions, and judgments regarding the cost, timing of settlement, our MGP's credit-adjusted risk-free rate and inflation rates.
Reserve Estimates
Our estimates of proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and future net revenues from them are based upon reserve analyses that rely upon various assumptions, including those required by the SEC, as to natural gas, oil and NGL prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures and availability of funds. The accuracy of these reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following: the quality and quantity of available data, the interpretation of that data, the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions, and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates. We engaged Wright & Company, Inc., an independent third-party reserve engineer, to prepare a report of our proved reserves (See "Item 2: Properties").
Any significant variance in the assumptions utilized in the calculation of our reserve estimates could materially affect the estimated quantity of our reserves. As a result, our estimates of proved natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise. Actual future production, natural gas, oil and NGL prices, revenues, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas, oil and NGL reserves may vary substantially from our estimates or estimates contained in the reserve reports and may affect our ability to pay distributions. In addition, our proved reserves may be subject to downward or upward revision based upon production history, prevailing natural gas, oil and NGL prices, mechanical difficulties, governmental regulation and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact the calculation of impairment and depletion of natural gas, oil and NGL properties. Generally, an increase or decrease in reserves without a corresponding change in capitalized costs will have a corresponding inverse impact to depletion expense.
We have experienced significant downward revisions of our natural gas and oil reserves volumes and values to zero in 2015 due to the recent significant declines in commodity prices. The proved reserves quantities and future net cash flows were estimated under the SEC's standardized measure using an unweighted 12-month average pricing based on the gas and oil prices on the first day of each month during the year ended December 31, 2015, including adjustments related to regional price differentials and energy content. The SEC's standardized measure of reserve quantities and discounted future net cash flows may not represent the fair market value of our gas and oil equivalent reserves due to anticipated future changes in gas and oil commodity prices. Accordingly, such information should not serve as a basis in making any judgment on the potential value of recoverable reserves or in estimating future results of operations.
Asset Retirement Obligations
We recognize and estimate the liability for the plugging and abandonment of our gas and oil wells. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset.
The estimated liability is based on our historical experience in plugging and abandoning wells, estimated remaining lives of those wells based on reserve estimates, external estimates as to the cost to plug and abandon the wells in the future and federal and state regulatory requirements. The liability is discounted using our MGP's assumed credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in estimates of plugging and abandonment costs or remaining lives of the wells, or if federal or state regulators enact new plugging and abandonment requirements. We have no assets legally restricted for purposes of settling asset retirement obligations. Except for our gas and oil properties, we believe that there are no other material retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets.



                                       29


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Working Interest
Our Partnership Agreement establishes that revenues and expenses will be allocated to our MGP and limited partners based on their ratio of capital contributions to total contributions ("working interest"). Our MGP is also provided an additional working interest of 7% as provided in the Partnership Agreement. Due to the time necessary to complete drilling operations and accumulate all drilling costs, estimated working interest percentage ownership rates are utilized to allocate revenues and expense until the wells are completely drilled and turned on-line into production. Once the wells are completed, the final working interest ownership of the partners is determined and any previously allocated revenues based on the estimated working interest percentage ownership are adjusted to conform to the final working interest percentage ownership.

all acreage encompassed therein.                  

       If the well to be drilled by the Partnership is to a Horizon containing
  Proved Reserves, then a "Prospect" for a particular Horizon may be
     limited to the minimum area permitted by state law or local practice,
  whichever is applicable, to protect against drainage from adjacent
    wells. Subject to the foregoing sentence, "Prospect" shall be deemed
the drilling or spacing unit for the Clinton/Medina geological  
formation and the Mississippian and/or Upper Devonian Sandstone 
reservoirs in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York.                 

47.     "Proved Developed Oil and Gas Reserves" means reserves that can be      
       expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment
     and operating methods. Additional oil and gas expected to be obtained
     through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery
 techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of
       primary recovery should be included as "proved developed reserves" only
       after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed
program has confirmed through production response that increased
recovery will be achieved.                                      

48.     "Proved Reserves" means the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural  
  gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
       demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years
       from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions,
  i.e., prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made. Prices
    include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
  contractual arrangements, but not on escalations based upon future
conditions.                                                     

    (i)    Reservoirs are considered proved if economic producibility is
           supported by either actual production or conclusive formation
       test. The area of a reservoir considered proved includes:

             (a)     that portion delineated by drilling and defined by gas-
        oil and/or oil-water contacts, if any; and

             (b)     the immediately adjoining portions not yet drilled, but
            which can be reasonably judged as economically
                 productive on the basis of available geological and
engineering data.                 

         In the absence of information on fluid contacts, the lowest
            known structural occurrence of hydrocarbons controls the lower
proved limit of the reservoir.                    

      (ii)   Reserves which can be produced economically through application
           of improved recovery techniques (such as fluid injection) are
             included in the "proved" classification when successful testing
             by a pilot project, or the operation of an installed program in
             the reservoir, provides support for the engineering analysis on
which the project or program was based.           

 (iii)  Estimates of proved reserves do not include the following:

             (a)     oil that may become available from known reservoirs but
               is classified separately as "indicated additional
reserves";                        

          (b)     crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids, the
                      recovery of which is subject to reasonable doubt because
                      of uncertainty as to geology, reservoir characteristics,

amount designated as the subscription price on the Subscription Agreement       
executed by the Participant 100% in cash at the time of subscribing. A

    General Partner's cash distributions directly from the
          Partnership until the amount in default is recovered in full
plus interest at the legal rate; and

interest at the legal rate.

assign or cause to have assigned to the Partnership full or partial interests   
in Leases, by any method customary in the natural gas and oil industry,         
subject to the terms and conditions set forth below.                            

The Partnership and other partnerships in Atlas America Public #12-2003

the same Prospects, in the Managing General Partner's discretion.               

The Partnership shall acquire only Leases reasonably expected to meet the       
stated purposes of the Partnership. No Leases shall be acquired for the         
purpose of a subsequent sale, Farmout, or other disposition unless the          
acquisition is made after a well has been drilled to a depth sufficient to      
indicate that the acquisition would be in the Partnership's best interest.      

4.01(a)(2). Federal and State Leases. The Partnership is authorized to acquire  
Leases on federal and state lands.                                              

4.01(a)(3). Managing General Partner's Discretion as to Terms and Burdens of

     or its Affiliates other than an affiliated program; and

(ii)   credited towards the Managing General Partner's required 
            Capital Contribution set forth in ss.3.03(b)(1) at the Cost of
         the Lease, unless the Managing General Partner has cause to
             believe that Cost is materially more than the fair market value
            of the property, in which case the credit for the contribution
             must be made at a price not in excess of the fair market value.

A determination of fair market value must be:                                   

(i)    supported by an appraisal from an Independent Expert; and

in the Remainder Interests. Subject to the provisions of ss.4.03(d) and its     
subsections, to the extent the Partnership does not acquire a full interest in  
a Lease from the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates, the remainder of   
the interest in the Lease may be held by the Managing General Partner or its    
Affiliates. They may either:                                                    

(i)    retain and exploit the remaining interest for their own  
account; or                                       

  (ii)   sell or otherwise dispose of all or a part of the remaining
interest.

Affiliates to the exclusion of the Partnership.                                 

4.01(a)(6). No Breach of Duty. Subject to the provisions of ss.4.03 and its     
subsections, acquisition of Leases from the Managing General Partner, the       
Operator or their Affiliates shall not be considered a breach of any            
obligation owed by them to the Partnership or the Participants.                 

4.01(b). No Overriding Royalty Interests. Neither the Managing General

shall be held on a permanent basis in the name of the Partnership. However,     
Partnership properties may be held temporarily in the name of:                  

(i)    the Managing General Partner;                            

(ii)   the Operator;

    (iv)   in the name of any nominee designated by the Managing General
      Partner to facilitate the acquisition of the properties.

4.01(c)(2). Managing General Partner's Discretion. The Managing General         
Partner shall take the steps which are necessary in its best judgment to        
render title to the Leases to be acquired by the Partnership acceptable for     
the purposes of the Partnership. The Managing General Partner shall be free,    
however, to use its own best judgment in waiving title requirements.            

The Managing General Partner shall not be liable to the Partnership or to the   
other parties for any mistakes of judgment; nor shall the Managing General      
Partner be deemed to be making any warranties or representations, express or    
implied, as to the validity or merchantability of the title to the Leases       
assigned to the Partnership or the extent of the interest covered thereby       
except as otherwise provided in the Drilling and Operating Agreement.

               his opinion the financial statements present fairly the financial
               position, results of operations, partners' equity, and cash flows
          in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
Semiannual reports are not required to be audited.

            costs allocated did not materially exceed the amounts actually

The reserve computations shall be based on engineering reports prepared by the

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managing General Partner may keep logs,

          forth in ss.4.01(a)(4) or fair market value of any producing

            telephone numbers of the Participants along with the number of
         Units held by each of them (the "Participant List") must be
             maintained as a part of the Partnership's books and records and
   be available for inspection by any Participant or his
           designated agent at the home office of the Partnership on the
Participant's request;                            

 (ii)   the Participant List must be updated at least quarterly to
             reflect changes in the information contained in the Participant
List;                                             

22

P-->EX-425th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
(iii)  a copy of the Participant List must be mailed to any     
           Participant requesting the Participant List within 10 days of
         the written request, printed in alphabetical order on white
            paper, and in a readily readable type size in no event smaller
           than 10-point type and a reasonable charge for copy work will
be charged by the Partnership;                    

     (iv)   the purposes for which a Participant may request a copy of the
            Participant List include, without limitation, matters relating
         to Participant's voting rights under this Agreement and the
            exercise of Participant's rights under the federal proxy laws;
and                                               

      (v)    if the Managing General Partner neglects or refuses to exhibit,
           produce, or mail a copy of the Participant List as requested,
             the Managing General Partner shall be liable to any Participant
          requesting the list for the costs, including attorneys fees,
           incurred by that Participant for compelling the production of
          the Participant List, and for actual damages suffered by any
            Participant by reason of the refusal or neglect. It shall be a
            defense that the actual purpose and reason for the request for
           inspection or for a copy of the Participant List is to secure
           the list of Participants or other information for the purpose
             of selling the list or information or copies of the list, or of
       using the same for a commercial purpose other than in the
        interest of the applicant as a Participant relative to the
           affairs of the Partnership. The Managing General Partner will
        require the Participant requesting the Participant List to
        represent in writing that the list was not requested for a
           commercial purpose unrelated to the Participant's interest in
             the Partnership. The remedies provided under this subsection to
           Participants requesting copies of the Participant List are in
         addition to, and shall not in any way limit, other remedies
            available to Participants under federal law or the laws of any
state.                                            

4.03(b)(8). State Filings. Concurrently with their transmittal to               
Participants, and as required, the Managing General Partner shall file a copy   
of each report provided for in this ss.4.03(b) with:                            

(i)    the California Commissioner of Corporations; and         

(ii)   The Arizona Corporation Commission; and                  

   (iii)  the securities commissions of other states which request the
report.                                           

4.03(c). Meetings of Participants.                                              

4.03(c)(1). Procedure for a Participant Meeting.

 (ii)   by Participants whose Units equal 10% or more of the total

The call for a meeting by Participants shall be deemed to have been made on     
receipt by the Managing General Partner of a written request from holders of    
the requisite percentage of Units stating the purpose(s) of the meeting.        

4.03(c)(1)(b). Notice Requirement. The Managing General Partner shall deposit   
in the United States mail within 15 days after the receipt of the request,      
written notice to all Participants of the meeting and the purpose of the        
meeting. The meeting shall be held on a date not less than 30 days nor more     
than 60 days after the date of the mailing of the notice, at a reasonable time  
and place.                                                                      

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the date for notice of the meeting may be        
extended for a period of up to 60 days if, in the opinion of the Managing       
General Partner, the additional time is necessary to permit preparation of      
proxy or information statements or other documents required to be delivered in  
connection with the meeting by the SEC or other regulatory authorities.

(i)    in person; or                                            

(ii)   by proxy.                                                

4.03(c)(2). Special Voting Rights. At the request of Participants whose Units   
equal 10% or more of the total Units, the Managing General Partner shall call   
for a vote by Participants. Each Unit is entitled to one vote on all matters,   
and each fractional Unit is entitled to that fraction of one vote equal to the  
fractional interest in the Unit. Participants whose Units equal a majority of   
the total Units may, without the concurrence of the Managing General Partner    
or its Affiliates, vote to:                                                     

(i)    dissolve the Partnership;                                

   (ii)   remove the Managing General Partner and elect a new Managing
General Partner;                                  

   (iii)  elect a new Managing General Partner if the Managing General
Partner elects to withdraw from the Partnership;  

(iv)   remove the Operator and elect a new Operator;            

    (v)    approve or disapprove the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Partnership;                    

 (vi)   cancel any contract for services with the Managing General
           Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates without penalty on
60 days notice; and                               

(vii)  amend this Agreement; provided however:                  

              (a)     any amendment may not increase the duties or liabilities
                   of any Participant or the Managing General Partner or
                increase or decrease the profit or loss sharing or
                     required Capital Contribution of any Participant or the
                  Managing General Partner without the approval of the
              Participant or the Managing General Partner; and

        (b)     any amendment may not affect the classification of
                Partnership income and loss for federal income tax
            purposes without the unanimous approval of all
Participants.                     

4.03(c)(3). Restrictions on Managing General Partner's Voting Rights. With      
respect to Units owned by the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates, the   
Managing General Partner and its Affiliates may vote or consent on all matters  
other than the following:                                                       

    (i)    the matters set forth in ss.4.03(c)(2)(ii) and (iv) above; or

(ii)   any transaction between the Partnership and the Managing 
General Partner or its Affiliates.                

In determining the requisite percentage in interest of Units necessary to       
approve any Partnership matter on which the Managing General Partner and its    
Affiliates may not vote or consent, any Units owned by the Managing General     
Partner and its Affiliates shall not be included.                               

4.03(c)(4). Restrictions on Limited Partner Voting Rights. The exercise by the  
Limited Partners of the rights granted Participants under ss.4.03(c), except    
for the special voting rights granted Participants under ss.4.03(c)(2), shall   
be subject to the prior legal determination that the grant or exercise of the   
powers will not adversely affect the limited liability of Limited Partners.     
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if in the opinion of counsel to the Partnership  
the legal determination is not necessary under Delaware law to maintain the     
limited liability of the Limited Partners, then it shall not be required. A     
legal determination under this paragraph may be made either pursuant to:        

24

P-->EX-427th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
  (i)    an opinion of counsel, the counsel being independent of the
            Partnership and selected on the vote of Limited Partners whose
       Units equal a majority of the total Units held by Limited
Partners; or                                      

(ii)   a declaratory judgment issued by a court of competent    
jurisdiction.                                     

The Investor General Partners may exercise the rights granted to the            
Participants whether or not the Limited Partners can participate in the vote    
if the Investor General Partners represent the requisite percentage of Units    
necessary to take the action.                                                   

4.03(d). Transactions with the Managing General Partner.                        

4.03(d)(1). Transfer of Equal Proportionate Interest. When the Managing         
General Partner or an Affiliate (excluding another Program in which the         
interest of the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates is substantially     
similar to or less than their interest in the Partnership) sells, transfers or  
conveys any natural gas, oil or other mineral interests or property to the      
Partnership, it must, at the same time, sell, transfer or convey to the         
Partnership an equal proportionate interest in all its other property in the    
same Prospect. Notwithstanding, a Prospect shall be deemed to consist of the    
drilling or spacing unit on which the well will be drilled by the Partnership,  
which is the minimum area permitted by state law or local practice on which     
one well may be drilled, if the following conditions are met:                   

(i)    the geological feature to which the well will be drilled 
contains Proved Reserves; and                     

(ii)   the drilling or spacing unit protects against drainage.  

With respect to a natural gas or oil Prospect located in Ohio, Pennsylvania     
and New York on which a well will be drilled by the Partnership to test the     
Clinton/Medina geological formation or the Mississippian and/or Upper Devonian  
Sandstone reservoirs, a Prospect shall be deemed to consist of the drilling     
and spacing unit if it meets the test in the preceding sentence. Additionally,  
for a period of five years after the drilling of the Partnership Well neither   
the Managing General Partner nor its Affiliates may drill any well:             

      (i)    in the Clinton/Medina geological formation within 1,650 feet of
          an existing Partnership Well in Pennsylvania or within 1,000
feet of an existing Partnership Well in Ohio; or  

  (ii)   in the Mississippian/Upper Devonian Sandstone reservoirs in
         Fayette County and Greene County, Pennsylvania within 1,000
           feet of an existing Partnership Well, although existing wells
          may be re-entered by parties other than the Partnership even
though they are not 1,000 feet from each other.   

If the Partnership abandons its interest in a well, then this restriction will  
continue for one year following the abandonment.                                

If the area constituting the Partnership's Prospect is subsequently enlarged    
to encompass any area in which the Managing General Partner or an Affiliate     
(excluding another Program in which the interest of the Managing General        
Partner or its Affiliates is substantially similar to or less than their        
interest in the Partnership) owns a separate property interest and the          
activities of the Partnership were material in establishing the existence of    
Proved Undeveloped Reserves that are attributable to the separate property      
interest, then the separate property interest or a portion thereof must be      
sold, transferred, or conveyed to the Partnership as set forth in this section  
and ss.ss.4.01(a)(4) and 4.03(d)(2).                                            

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Prospects in the Clinton/Medina geological       
formation, the Mississippian and/or Upper Devonian Sandstone reservoirs, or     
any other formation or reservoir shall not be enlarged or contracted if the     
Prospect was limited to the drilling or spacing unit because the well was       
being drilled to Proved Reserves in the geological formation and the drilling   
or spacing unit protected against drainage.                                     

4.03(d)(2). Transfer of Less than the Managing General Partner's and its        
Affiliates' Entire Interest. A sale, transfer or a conveyance to the Partnership
of less than all of the ownership of the Managing General Partner or an         
Affiliate (excluding another Program in which the interest of the Managing      
General Partner or its Affiliates is substantially similar to or less than their
interest in the Partnership) in any Prospect shall not be made unless:          

25

P-->EX-428th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
   (i)    the interest retained by the Managing General Partner or the
Affiliate is a proportionate Working Interest;    

    (ii)   the respective obligations of the Managing General Partner or
           its Affiliates and the Partnership are substantially the same
            after the sale of the interest by the Managing General Partner
or its Affiliates; and                            

   (iii)  the Managing General Partner's interest in revenues does not
     exceed the amount proportionate to its retained Working
Interest.                                         

This section does not prevent the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates    
from subsequently dealing with their retained interest as they may choose with  
unaffiliated parties or Affiliated partnerships.                                

4.03(d)(3). Limitations on Sale of Undeveloped and Developed Leases to the      
Managing General Partner. Other than another Program managed by the Managing    
General Partner and its Affiliates as set forth in ss.ss.4.03(d)(5) and         
4.03(d)(9), the Managing General Partner and its Affiliates shall not Farmout   
or purchase any undeveloped Leases from the Partnership other than at the       
higher of Cost or fair market value.                                            

The Managing General Partner and its Affiliates, other than an Affiliated       
Income Program, may not purchase any producing natural gas or oil property      
from the Partnership unless:                                                    

(i)    the sale is in connection with the liquidation of the    
Partnership; or                                   

     (ii)   the Managing General Partner's well supervision fees under the
             Drilling and Operating Agreement for the well have exceeded the
        net revenues of the well, determined without regard to the
            Managing General Partner's well supervision fees for the well,
for a period of at least three consecutive months.

In both (i) and (ii), the sale must be at fair market value supported by an     
appraisal of an Independent Expert selected by the Managing General Partner.    

4.03(d)(4). Limitations on Activities of the Managing General Partner and its   
Affiliates on Leases Acquired by the Partnership. During a period of five       
years after the Offering Termination Date of the Partnership, if the Managing   
General Partner or any of its Affiliates (excluding another Program in which    
the interest of the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates is               
substantially similar to or less than their interest in the Partnership)        
proposes to acquire an interest from an unaffiliated person in a Prospect in    
which the Partnership possesses an interest or in a Prospect in which the       
Partnership's interest has been terminated without compensation within one      
year preceding the proposed acquisition, then the following conditions shall    
apply:                                                                          

  (i)    if the Managing General Partner or the Affiliate (excluding
           another Program in which the interest of the Managing General
           Partner or its Affiliates is substantially similar to or less
            than their interest in the Partnership) does not currently own
            property in the Prospect separately from the Partnership, then
             neither the Managing General Partner nor the Affiliate shall be
    permitted to purchase an interest in the Prospect; and

  (ii)   if the Managing General Partner or the Affiliate (excluding
           another Program in which the interest of the Managing General
           Partner or its Affiliates is substantially similar to or less
      than their interest in the Partnership) currently owns a
        proportionate interest in the Prospect separately from the
            Partnership, then the interest to be acquired shall be divided
             between the Partnership and the Managing General Partner or the
              Affiliate in the same proportion as is the other property in the
      Prospect. Provided, however, if cash or financing is not
              available to the Partnership to enable it to complete a purchase
              of the additional interest to which it is entitled, then neither
               the Managing General Partner nor the Affiliate shall be permitted
  to purchase any additional interest in the Prospect.

4.03(d)(5). Transfer of Leases Between Affiliated Limited Partnerships. The     
transfer of an undeveloped Lease from the Partnership to an Affiliated Drilling 
Program must be made at fair market value if the undeveloped Lease has been held
for                                                                             

26

P-->EX-429th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
more than two years. Otherwise, if the Managing General Partner deems it to be  
in the best interest of the Partnership, the transfer may be made at Cost.      

An Affiliated Income Program may purchase a producing natural gas and oil       
property from the Partnership at any time at:                                   

(i)    fair market value as supported by an appraisal from an   
     Independent Expert if the property has been held by the
     Partnership for more than six months or there have been
            significant expenditures made in connection with the property;
or                                                

  (ii)   Cost as adjusted for intervening operations if the Managing
        General Partner deems it to be in the best interest of the
Partnership.                                      

However, these prohibitions shall not apply to joint ventures or Farmouts       
among Affiliated partnerships, provided that:                                   

    (i)    the respective obligations and revenue sharing of all parties
to the transaction are substantially the same; and

     (ii)   the compensation arrangement or any other interest or right of
          either the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates is the
      same in each Affiliated partnership or if different, the
           aggregate compensation of the Managing General Partner or the
    Affiliate is reduced to reflect the lower compensation
arrangement.                                      

4.03(d)(6). Sale of All Assets. The sale of all or substantially all of the     
assets of the Partnership, including without limitation, Leases, wells,         
equipment and production therefrom, shall be made only with the consent of      
Participants whose Units equal a majority of the total Units.                   

4.03(d)(7). Services.                                                           

4.03(d)(7)(a). Competitive Rates. The Managing General Partner and any          
Affiliate shall not render to the Partnership any oil field, equipage, or       
other services nor sell or lease to the Partnership any equipment or related    
supplies unless:                                                                

     (i)    the person is engaged, independently of the Partnership and as
            an ordinary and ongoing business, in the business of rendering
           the services or selling or leasing the equipment and supplies
             to a substantial extent to other persons in the natural gas and
       oil industry in addition to the partnerships in which the
           Managing General Partner or an Affiliate has an interest; and

      (ii)   the compensation, price, or rental therefor is competitive with
             the compensation, price, or rental of other persons in the area
         engaged in the business of rendering comparable services or
        selling or leasing comparable equipment and supplies which
    could reasonably be made available to the Partnership.

If the person is not engaged in such a business, then the compensation, price   
or rental shall be the Cost of the services, equipment or supplies to the       
person or the competitive rate which could be obtained in the area, whichever   
is less.                                                                        

4.03(d)(7)(b). If Not Disclosed in the Prospectus or This Agreement Then        
Services by the Managing General Partner Must be Described in a Separate        
Contract and Cancelable. Any services for which the Managing General Partner    
or an Affiliate is to receive compensation other than those described in this   
Agreement or the Prospectus shall be set forth in a written contract which      
precisely describes the services to be rendered and all compensation to be      
paid. These contracts are cancelable without penalty on 60 days written notice  
by Participants whose Units equal a majority of the total Units.                

4.03(d)(8). Loans.                                                              

4.03(d)(8)(a). No Loans from the Partnership. No loans or advances shall be     
made by the Partnership to the Managing General Partner or any Affiliate.       

4.03(d)(8)(b). Loans to the Partnership. Neither the Managing General Partner   
nor any Affiliate shall loan money to the Partnership if the interest to be     
charged exceeds either:                                                         

27

P-->EX-430th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
 (i)    the Managing General Partner's or the Affiliate's interest
cost; or                                          

(ii)   that which would be charged to the Partnership, without  
            reference to the Managing General Partner's or the Affiliate's
         financial abilities or guarantees, by unrelated lenders, on
comparable loans for the same purpose.            

Neither the Managing General Partner nor any Affiliate shall receive points or  
other financing charges or fees, regardless of the amount, although the actual  
amount of the charges incurred from third-party lenders may be reimbursed to    
the Managing General Partner or the Affiliate.                                  

4.03(d)(9). Farmouts. The Managing General Partner shall not enter into a       
Farmout to avoid its paying its share of costs related to drilling an           
undeveloped Lease. The Partnership shall not Farmout an undeveloped Lease or    
well activity to the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates except as set   
forth in ss.4.03(d)(3). Notwithstanding, this restriction shall not apply to    
Farmouts between the Partnership and another partnership managed by the         
Managing General Partner or its Affiliates, either separately or jointly,       
provided that the respective obligations and revenue sharing of all parties to  
the transactions are substantially the same and the compensation arrangement    
or any other interest or right of the Managing General Partner or its           
Affiliates is the same in each partnership, or, if different, the aggregate     
compensation of the Managing General Partner and its Affiliates is reduced to   
reflect the lower compensation agreement.                                       

The Partnership may Farmout an undeveloped lease or well activity only if the   
Managing General Partner, exercising the standard of a prudent operator,        
determines that:                                                                

  (i)    the Partnership lacks the funds to complete the oil and gas
        operations on the Lease or well and cannot obtain suitable
financing;                                        

(ii)   drilling on the Lease or the intended well activity would
         concentrate excessive funds in one location, creating undue
risks to the Partnership;                         

 (iii)  the Leases or well activity have been downgraded by events
   occurring after assignment to the Partnership so that
     development of the Leases or well activity would not be
desirable; or                                     

(iv)   the best interests of the Partnership would be served.   

If the Partnership Farmouts a Lease or well activity, the Managing General      
Partner must retain on behalf of the Partnership the economic interests and     
concessions as a reasonably prudent oil and gas operator would or could retain  
under the circumstances prevailing at the time, consistent with industry        
practices.                                                                      

4.03(d)(10). No Compensating Balances. Neither the Managing General Partner     
nor any Affiliate shall use the Partnership's funds as compensating balances    
for its own benefit.                                                            

4.03(d)(11). Future Production. Neither the Managing General Partner nor any    
Affiliate shall commit the future production of a well developed by the         
Partnership exclusively for its own benefit.                                    

4.03(d)(12). Marketing Arrangements. Subject to ss.4.06(c), all benefits from   
marketing arrangements or other relationships affecting the property of the     
Managing General Partner or its Affiliates and the Partnership shall be fairly  
and equitably apportioned according to the respective interests of each in the  
property. The Managing General Partner shall treat all wells in a geographic    
area equally concerning to whom and at what price the Partnership's natural gas 
and oil will be sold and to whom and at what price the natural gas and oil of   
other natural gas and oil Programs which the Managing General Partner has       
sponsored or will sponsor will be sold. For example, the Managing General       
Partner calculates a weighted average selling price for all the natural gas and 
oil sold in a geographic area by taking all the money received from the sale of 
all the natural gas and oil sold to its customers in a geographic area and      
dividing by the volume of all natural gas and oil sold from the wells in that   
geographic area. The Managing General Partner, in its sole discretion, shall    
determine what constitutes a geographic area.

4.03(d)(13). Advance Payments. Advance payments by the Partnership to the       
Managing General Partner and its Affiliates are prohibited except when advance  
payments are required to secure the tax benefits of prepaid drilling costs and  
for a business purpose.                                                         

4.03(d)(14). No Rebates. No rebates or give-ups may be received by the          
Managing General Partner or any Affiliate nor may the Managing General Partner  
or any Affiliate participate in any reciprocal business arrangements which

4.03(d)(15). Participation in Other Partnerships. If the Partnership            
participates in other partnerships or joint ventures (multi-tier                
arrangements), then the terms of any of these arrangements shall not result in  
the circumvention of any of the requirements or prohibitions contained in this  
Agreement, including the following:                                             

    (i)    there shall be no duplication or increase in organization and
             offering expenses, the Managing General Partner's compensation,
Partnership expenses or other fees and costs;     

    (ii)   there shall be no substantive alteration in the fiduciary and
           contractual relationship between the Managing General Partner
and the Participants; and                         

 (iii)  there shall be no diminishment in the voting rights of the
Participants.                                     

4.03(d)(16). Roll-Up Limitations.                                               

4.03(d)(16)(a). Requirement for Appraisal and Its Assumptions. In connection    
with a proposed Roll-Up, an appraisal of all Partnership assets shall be        
obtained from a competent Independent Expert. If the appraisal will be          
included in a prospectus used to offer securities of a Roll-Up Entity, then     
the appraisal shall be filed with the SEC and the Administrator as an exhibit   
to the registration statement for the offering. Thus, an issuer using the       
appraisal shall be subject to liability for violation of Section 11 of the      
Securities Act of 1933 and comparable provisions under state law for any        
material misrepresentations or material omissions in the appraisal.             

Partnership assets shall be appraised on a consistent basis. The appraisal      
shall be based on all relevant information, including current reserve           
estimates prepared by an independent petroleum consultant, and shall indicate   
the value of the Partnership's assets as of a date immediately before the       
announcement of the proposed Roll-Up transaction. The appraisal shall assume    
an orderly liquidation of the Partnership's assets over a 12-month period.      

The terms of the engagement of the Independent Expert shall clearly state that  
the engagement is for the benefit of the Partnership and the Participants. A    
summary of the independent appraisal, indicating all material assumptions       
underlying the appraisal, shall be included in a report to the Participants in  
connection with a proposed Roll-Up.                                             

4.03(d)(16)(b). Rights of Participants Who Vote Against Proposal. In            
connection with a proposed Roll-Up, Participants who vote "no" on the proposal  
shall be offered the choice of:                                                 

    (i)    accepting the securities of the Roll-Up Entity offered in the
proposed Roll-Up; or                              

(ii)   one of the following:                                    

               (a)   remaining as Participants in the Partnership and preserving
              their Units in the Partnership on the same terms and
conditions as existed previously; or  

              (b)   receiving cash in an amount equal to the Participants' pro
                    rata share of the appraised value of the net assets of the
                Partnership based on their respective number of Units.

4.03(d)(16)(c). No Roll-Up If Diminishment of Voting Rights. The Partnership    
shall not participate in any proposed Roll-Up which, if approved, would result  
in the diminishment of any Participant's voting rights under the Roll-Up        
Entity's chartering agreement.                                                  

29

P-->EX-432nd�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
In no event shall the democracy rights of Participants in the Roll-Up Entity    
be less than those provided for under ss.ss.4.03(c)(1) and 4.03(c)(2) of this   
Agreement. If the Roll-Up Entity is a corporation, then the democracy rights    
of Participants shall correspond to the democracy rights provided for in this   
Agreement to the greatest extent possible.                                      

4.03(d)(16)(d). No Roll-Up If Accumulation of Shares Would be Impeded. The      
Partnership shall not participate in any proposed Roll-Up transaction which     
includes provisions which would operate to materially impede or frustrate the   
accumulation of shares by any purchaser of the securities of the Roll-Up        
Entity, except to the minimum extent necessary to preserve the tax status of    
the Roll-Up Entity.                                                             

The Partnership shall not participate in any proposed Roll-Up transaction       
which would limit the ability of a Participant to exercise the voting rights    
of its securities of the Roll-Up Entity on the basis of the number of Units     
held by that Participant.                                                       

4.03(d)(16)(e). No Roll-Up If Access to Records Would Be Limited. The           
Partnership shall not participate in a Roll-Up in which Participants' rights    
of access to the records of the Roll-Up Entity will be less than those          
provided for under ss.ss.4.03(b)(5), 4.03(b)(6) and 4.03(b)(7) of this          
Agreement.                                                                      

4.03(d)(16)(f). Cost of Roll-Up. The Partnership shall not participate in any   
proposed Roll-Up transaction in which any of the costs of the transaction       
would be borne by the Partnership if Participants whose Units equal 66% of the  
total Units do not vote to approve the proposed Roll-Up.                        

4.03(d)(16)(g). Roll-Up Approval. The Partnership shall not participate in a    
Roll-Up transaction unless the Roll-Up transaction is approved by Participants  
whose Units equal 66% of the total Units.                                       

4.03(d)(17). Disclosure of Binding Agreements. Any agreement or arrangement     
which binds the Partnership must be disclosed in the Prospectus.                

4.03(d)(18). Transactions Must Be Fair and Reasonable. Neither the Managing     
General Partner nor any Affiliate shall sell, transfer, or convey any property  
to or purchase any property from the Partnership, directly or indirectly,       
except:                                                                         

(i)    under transactions that are fair and reasonable; nor     

    (ii)   take any action with respect to the assets or property of the
           Partnership which does not primarily benefit the Partnership.

4.04. Designation, Compensation and Removal of Managing General Partner and     
Removal of Operator.

4.04(a)(2)(c). Administrative Costs. The Managing General Partner shall         
receive an unaccountable, fixed payment reimbursement for its Administrative

reimbursement of $75 per well per month shall be subject to the following:      

 (i)    it shall not be increased in amount during the term of the
Partnership;                                      

(ii)   it shall be proportionately reduced to the extent the    
            Partnership acquires less than 100% of the Working Interest in

(iii)  it shall be the entire payment to reimburse the Managing

Partnership to interstate pipeline systems, local distribution companies and    
end-users in the area and shall receive a gathering fee at a competitive rate   
for gathering and transporting the Partnership's gas. If the Partnership's gas  
production is gathered and transported through the gathering system owned by    
Atlas Pipeline Partners, then the Managing General Partner shall apply its      
gathering fee towards the agreement between Atlas Pipeline Partners and Atlas   
America, Inc., Resource Energy, Inc., and Viking Resources Corporation. If the  
Partnership's gas production is gathered and transferred through the gathering

vote of Participants whose Units equal a majority of the total Units.           

If the Participants vote to remove the Managing General Partner from the        
Partnership, then Participants must elect by an affirmative vote of             
Participants whose Units equal a majority of the total Units either to:         

(i)    terminate, dissolve, and wind up the Partnership; or     

      (ii)   continue as a successor limited partnership under all the terms
      of this Partnership Agreement as provided in ss.7.01(c).

31

P-->EX-434th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
If the Participants elect to continue as a successor limited partnership, then  
the Managing General Partner shall not be removed until a substituted Managing  
General Partner has been selected by an affirmative vote of Participants whose  
Units equal a majority of the total Units and installed as such.                

4.04(a)(3)(b). Valuation of Managing General Partner's Interest in the          
Partnership. If the Managing General Partner is removed, then its interest in   
the Partnership shall be determined by appraisal by a qualified Independent     
Expert. The Independent Expert shall be selected by mutual agreement between    
the removed Managing General Partner and the incoming Managing General          
Partner. The appraisal shall take into account an appropriate discount, to      
reflect the risk of recovery of natural gas and oil reserves, but not less      
than that used in the most recent presentment offer, if any.                    

The cost of the appraisal shall be borne equally by the removed Managing        
General Partner and the Partnership.                                            

4.04(a)(3)(c). Incoming Managing General Partner's Option to Purchase. The      
incoming Managing General Partner shall have the option to purchase 20% of the  
removed Managing General Partner's interest in the Partnership as Managing      
General Partner and not as a Participant for the value determined by the        
Independent Expert.                                                             

4.04(a)(3)(d). Method of Payment. The method of payment for the removed         
Managing General Partner's interest must be fair and protect the solvency and   
liquidity of the Partnership. The method of payment shall be as follows:        

     (i)    when the termination is voluntary, the method of payment shall
      be a non-interest bearing unsecured promissory note with
        principal payable, if at all, from distributions which the
          Managing General Partner otherwise would have received under
            the Partnership Agreement had the Managing General Partner not
been terminated; and                              

 (ii)   when the termination is involuntary, the method of payment
           shall be an interest bearing promissory note coming due in no
         less than five years with equal installments each year. The
      interest rate shall be that charged on comparable loans.

4.04(a)(3)(e). Termination of Contracts. The removed Managing General Partner,  
at the time of its removal shall cause, to the extent it is legally possible,   
its successor to be transferred or assigned all its rights, obligations and     
interests as Managing General Partner of the Partnership in contracts entered   
into by it on behalf of the Partnership. In any event, the removed Managing     
General Partner shall cause its rights, obligations and interests as Managing   
General Partner of the Partnership in any such contract to terminate at the     
time of its removal.                                                            

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the Partnership or the   
successor Managing General Partner shall not:                                   

(i)    be a party to any natural gas supply agreement that the  
           Managing General Partner or its Affiliates enters into with a
third-party;                                      

     (ii)   have any rights pursuant to such natural gas supply agreement;
or                                                

     (iii)  receive any interest in the Managing General Partner's and its
     Affiliates' pipeline or gathering system or compression
facilities.                                       

4.04(a)(3)(f). The Managing General Partner's Right to Voluntarily Withdraw.    
At any time beginning 10 years after the Offering Termination Date and the      
Partnership's primary drilling activities, the Managing General Partner may     
voluntarily withdraw as Managing General Partner on giving 120 days' written    
notice of withdrawal to the Participants. If the Managing General Partner       
withdraws, then the following conditions shall apply:                           

 (i)    the Managing General Partner's interest in the Partnership
             shall be determined as described in ss.4.04(a)(3)(b) above with
respect to removal; and                           

(ii)   the interest shall be distributed to the Managing General
Partner as described in ss.4.04(a)(3)(d)(i) above.

32

P-->EX-435th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
Any successor Managing General Partner shall have the option to purchase 20%    
of the withdrawing Managing General Partner's interest in the Partnership at    
the value determined as described above with respect to removal.                

4.04(a)(3)(g). The Managing General Partner's Right to Withdraw Property        
Interest. The Managing General Partner has the right at any time to withdraw a  
property interest held by the Partnership in the form of a Working Interest in  
the Partnership Wells equal to or less than its respective interest in the      
revenues of the Partnership under the conditions set forth in ss.6.03. If the   
Managing General Partner withdraws an interest, then the Managing General       
Partner shall:                                                                  

(i)    pay the expenses of withdrawing; and                     

      (ii)   fully indemnify the Partnership against any additional expenses
         which may result from a partial withdrawal of its interests
         including insuring that a greater amount of Direct Costs or
        Administrative Costs is not allocated to the Participants.

4.04(a)(4). Removal of Operator. The Operator may be removed and a new          
Operator may be substituted at any time on 60 days advance written notice to    
the outgoing Operator by the Managing General Partner acting on behalf of the   
Partnership on the affirmative vote of Participants whose Units equal a         
majority of the total Units.                                                    

The Operator shall not be removed until a substituted Operator has been         
selected by an affirmative vote of Participants whose Units equal a majority    
of the total Units and installed as such.                                       

4.05.   Indemnification and Exoneration.                                        

4.05(a)(1). Standards for the Managing General Partner Not Incurring Liability  
to the Partnership or Participants. The Managing General Partner, the           
Operator, and their Affiliates shall not have any liability whatsoever to the   
Partnership or to any Participant for any loss suffered by the Partnership or   
Participants which arises out of any action or inaction of the Managing         
General Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates if:

was in the best interest of the Partnership;      

(ii)   the Managing General Partner, the Operator, and their    
         Affiliates were acting on behalf of, or performing services
for, the Partnership; and                         

(iii)  the course of conduct did not constitute negligence or   
          misconduct of the Managing General Partner, the Operator, or
their Affiliates.                                 

4.05(a)(2). Standards for Managing General Partner Indemnification. The         
Managing General Partner, the Operator, and their Affiliates shall be           
indemnified by the Partnership against any losses, judgments, liabilities,      
expenses, and amounts paid in settlement of any claims sustained by them in     
connection with the Partnership, provided that:                                 

(i)    the Managing General Partner, the Operator, and their    
            Affiliates determined in good faith that the course of conduct

the Partnership;                                  

(ii)   the Managing General Partner, the Operator, and their    
         Affiliates were acting on behalf of, or performing services
for, the Partnership; and                         

(iii)  the course of conduct was not the result of negligence or
          misconduct of the Managing General Partner, the Operator, or
their Affiliates.                                 

Provided, however, payments arising from such indemnification or agreement to   
hold harmless are recoverable only out of the following:                        

(i)    tangible net assets;                                     

33

P-->EX-436th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
(ii)   revenues from operations; and                            

(iii)  any insurance proceeds.                                  

4.05(a)(3). Standards for Securities Law Indemnification. Notwithstanding       
anything to the contrary contained in the above, the Managing General Partner,  
the Operator, and their Affiliates and any person acting as a broker/dealer     
shall not be indemnified for any losses, liabilities or expenses arising from   
or out of an alleged violation of federal or state securities laws by such      
party unless:                                                                   

     (i)    there has been a successful adjudication on the merits of each
         count involving alleged securities law violations as to the
particular indemnitee;                            

     (ii)   the claims have been dismissed with prejudice on the merits by
    a court of competent jurisdiction as to the particular
indemnitee; or                                    

     (iii)  a court of competent jurisdiction approves a settlement of the
   claims against a particular indemnitee and finds that
            indemnification of the settlement and the related costs should
be made, and the court considering the request for
          indemnification has been advised of the position of the SEC,
             the Massachusetts Securities Division, and any state securities
      regulatory authority in which plaintiffs claim they were
offered or sold Units with respect to the issue of
indemnification for violation of securities laws. 

4.05(a)(4). Standards for Advancement of Funds to the Managing General Partner  
and Insurance. The advancement of Partnership funds to the Managing General     
Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates for legal expenses and other costs   
incurred as a result of any legal action for which indemnification is being     
sought is permissible only if the Partnership has adequate funds available and  
the following conditions are satisfied:                                         

    (i)    the legal action relates to acts or omissions with respect to
    the performance of duties or services on behalf of the
Partnership;                                      

  (ii)   the legal action is initiated by a third-party who is not a
            Participant, or the legal action is initiated by a Participant
             and a court of competent jurisdiction specifically approves the
advancement; and                                  

  (iii)  the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates undertake to
            repay the advanced funds to the Partnership, together with the
          applicable legal rate of interest thereon, in cases in which
        such party is found not to be entitled to indemnification.

The Partnership shall not bear the cost of that portion of insurance which      
insures the Managing General Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates for     
any liability for which they could not be indemnified pursuant to               
ss.ss.4.05(a)(1) and 4.05(a)(2).                                                

4.05(b). Liability of Partners. Under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited      
Partnership Act, the Investor General Partners are liable jointly and severally 
for all liabilities and obligations of the Partnership. Notwithstanding the     
foregoing, as among themselves, the Investor General Partners agree that each   
shall be solely and individually responsible only for his pro rata share of the 
liabilities and obligations of the Partnership based on his respective number of
Units.                                                                          

In addition, the Managing General Partner agrees to use its corporate assets    
to indemnify each of the Investor General Partners against all Partnership      
related liabilities which exceed the Investor General Partner's interest in     
the undistributed net assets of the Partnership and insurance proceeds, if      
any. Further, the Managing General Partner agrees to indemnify each Investor    
General Partner against any personal liability as a result of the unauthorized  
acts of another Investor General Partner.                                       

34

P-->EX-437th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
If the Managing General Partner provides indemnification, then each Investor    
General Partner who has been indemnified shall transfer and subrogate his       
rights for contribution from or against any other Investor General Partner to   
the Managing General Partner.                                                   

4.05(c). Order of Payment of Claims. Claims shall be paid as follows:           

(i)    first, out of any insurance proceeds;                    

(ii)   second, out of Partnership assets and revenues; and      

(iii)  last, by the Managing General Partner as provided in     
ss.ss.3.05(b)(2) and (3) and 4.05(b).             

No Limited Partner shall be required to reimburse the Managing General          
Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates or the Investor General Partners     
for any liability in excess of his agreed Capital Contribution, except:         

(i)    for a liability resulting from the Limited Partner's     
      unauthorized participation in Partnership management; or

(ii)   from some other breach by the Limited Partner of this    
Agreement.                                        

4.05(d). Authorized Transactions Are Not Deemed to Be a Breach. No transaction  
entered into or action taken by the Partnership or the Managing General         
Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates, which is authorized by this         
Agreement shall be deemed a breach of any obligation owed by the Managing       
General Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates to the Partnership or the    
Participants.                                                                   

4.06. Other Activities.                                                         

4.06(a). The Managing General Partner May Pursue Other Natural Gas and Oil      
Activities for Its Own Account. The Managing General Partner, the Operator,     
and their Affiliates are now engaged, and will engage in the future, for their  
own account and for the account of others, including other investors, in all    
aspects of the natural gas and oil business. This includes without limitation,  
the evaluation, acquisition, and sale of producing and nonproducing Leases,     
and the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and other minerals.  

The Managing General Partner is required to devote only so much of its time as  
is necessary to manage the affairs of the Partnership. Except as expressly      
provided to the contrary in this Agreement, and subject to fiduciary duties,    
the Managing General Partner, the Operator, and their Affiliates may do the     
following:                                                                      

      (i)    continue their activities, or initiate further such activities,
          individually, jointly with others, or as a part of any other
             limited or general partnership, tax partnership, joint venture,
           or other entity or activity to which they are or may become a
             party, in any locale and in the same fields, areas of operation
           or prospects in which the Partnership may likewise be active;

(ii)   reserve partial interests in Leases being assigned to the
            Partnership or any other interests not expressly prohibited by
this Agreement;                                   

      (iii)  deal with the Partnership as independent parties or through any
other entity in which they may be interested;     

 (iv)   conduct business with the Partnership as set forth in this
Agreement; and                                    

     (v)    participate in such other investor operations, as investors or
otherwise.                                        

The Managing General Partner and its Affiliates shall not be required to        
permit the Partnership or the Participants to participate in any of the         
operations in which the Managing General Partner and its Affiliates may be      
interested or share in any profits or other benefits from the operations.       
However, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Managing General   
Partner and its Affiliates may pursue business opportunities that are           
consistent with the Partnership's investment objectives for their own account   
only after they have determined that the opportunity either:                    

35

P-->EX-438th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
   (i)    cannot be pursued by the Partnership because of insufficient
funds; or                                         

   (ii)   it is not appropriate for the Partnership under the existing
circumstances.                                    

4.06(b). Managing General Partner May Manage Multiple Partnerships. The         
Managing General Partner or its Affiliates may manage multiple Programs         
simultaneously.                                                                 

4.06(c). Partnership Has No Interest in Natural Gas Contracts or Pipelines and  
Gathering Systems. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the   
Partnership shall not:                                                          

(i)    be a party to any natural gas supply agreement that the  
         Managing General Partner, the Operator, or their Affiliates
          enter into with a third-party or have any rights pursuant to
such natural gas supply agreement; or             

  (ii)   receive any interest in the Managing General Partner's, the
            Operator's, and their Affiliates' pipeline or gathering system
or compression facilities.                        

ARTICLE V 
PARTICIPATION IN COSTS AND REVENUES,
CAPITAL ACCOUNTS, ELECTIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS 

5.01. Participation in Costs and Revenues. Except as otherwise provided in      
this Agreement, costs and revenues shall be charged and credited to the         
Managing General Partner and the Participants as set forth in this section and  
its subsections.                                                                

5.01(a). Costs. Costs shall be charged as set forth below.                      

5.01(a)(1). Organization and Offering Costs. Organization and Offering Costs    
shall be charged 100% to the Managing General Partner. For purposes of sharing  
in revenues under ss.5.01(b)(4), the Managing General Partner shall be credited 
with Organization and Offering Costs paid by it and for services provided by it 
as Organization Costs up to and including 15% of the Partnership's subscription 
proceeds. Any Organization and Offering Costs paid and/or provided in services  
by the Managing General Partner in excess of this amount shall not be credited  
towards the Managing General Partner's required Capital Contribution or revenue 
share as set forth in ss.5.01(b)(4). The Managing General Partner's credit for  
services provided to the Partnership as Organization Costs shall be determined  
based on generally accepted accounting principles.                              

5.01(a)(2). Intangible Drilling Costs. Intangible Drilling Costs shall be       
charged 100% to the Participants.                                               

5.01(a)(3). Tangible Costs. Tangible Costs shall be charged 66% to the          
Managing General Partner and 34% to the Participants. However, if the total     
Tangible Costs for all of the Partnership's wells that would be charged to the  
Participants exceeds an amount equal to 10% of the Partnership's subscription   
proceeds, then the excess shall be charged to the Managing General Partner.     

5.01(a)(4). Operating Costs, Direct Costs, Administrative Costs and All Other   
Costs. Operating Costs, Direct Costs, Administrative Costs, and all other       
Partnership costs not specifically allocated shall be charged to the parties    
in the same ratio as the related production revenues are being credited.        

5.01(a)(5). Allocation of Intangible Drilling Costs and Tangible Costs at       
Partnership Closings. Intangible Drilling Costs and the Participants' share of  
Tangible Costs of a well or wells to be drilled and completed with the          
proceeds of a Partnership closing shall be charged 100% to the Participants     
who are admitted to the Partnership in that closing and shall not be            
reallocated to take into account other Partnership closings.                    

Although the proceeds of each Partnership closing will be used to pay the       
costs of drilling different wells, not less than 90% of each Participant's      
subscription proceeds shall be applied to Intangible Drilling Costs and not     
more than 10% of each Participant's subscription proceeds shall be applied to   
Tangible Costs regardless of when he subscribes.                                

36

P-->EX-439th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
5.01(a)(6). Lease Costs. The Leases shall be contributed to the Partnership by  
the Managing General Partner as set forth in ss.4.01(a)(4).                     

5.01(b). Revenues. Revenues shall be credited as set forth below.               

5.01(b)(1). Allocation of Revenues on Disposition of Property. If the parties'  
Capital Accounts are adjusted to reflect the simulated depletion of a natural   
gas or oil property of the Partnership, then the portion of the total amount    
realized by the Partnership on the taxable disposition of the property that     
represents recovery of its simulated tax basis in the property shall be         
allocated to the parties in the same proportion as the aggregate adjusted tax   
basis of the property was allocated to the parties or their predecessors in     
interest. If the parties' Capital Accounts are adjusted to reflect the actual   
depletion of a natural gas or oil property of the Partnership, then the         
portion of the total amount realized by the Partnership on the taxable          
disposition of the property that equals the parties' aggregate remaining        
adjusted tax basis in the property shall be allocated to the parties in         
proportion to their respective remaining adjusted tax bases in the property.    
Thereafter, any excess shall be allocated to the Managing General Partner in    
an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the Lease    
at the time it was contributed to the Partnership and its simulated or actual   
adjusted tax basis at that time. Finally, any excess shall be credited as       
provided in ss.5.01(b)(4), below.                                               

In the event of a sale of developed natural gas and oil properties with         
equipment on the properties, the Managing General Partner may make any          
reasonable allocation of proceeds between the equipment and the Leases.         

5.01(b)(2). Interest. Interest earned on each Participant's subscription        
proceeds before the Offering Termination Date under ss.3.05(b)(1) shall be      
credited to the accounts of the respective subscribers who paid the             
subscription proceeds to the Partnership. The interest shall be paid to the     
Participant not later than the Partnership's first cash distribution from       
operations.                                                                     

After the Offering Termination Date and until proceeds from the offering are    
invested in the Partnership's natural gas and oil operations, any interest      
income from temporary investments shall be allocated pro rata to the            
Participants providing the subscription proceeds.                               

All other interest income, including interest earned on the deposit of          
production revenues, shall be credited as provided in ss.5.01(b)(4), below.     

5.01(b)(3). Sale or Disposition of Equipment. Proceeds from the sale or         
disposition of equipment shall be credited to the parties charged with the      
costs of the equipment in the ratio in which the costs were charged.            

5.01(b)(4). Other Revenues. Subject to ss.5.01(b)(4)(a), the Managing General   
Partner and the Participants shall share in all other Partnership revenues in   
the same percentage as their respective Capital Contribution bears to the total 
Partnership Capital Contributions, except that the Managing General Partner     
shall receive an additional 7% of Partnership revenues. However, the Managing   
General Partner's total revenue share may not exceed 35% of Partnership         
revenues. For example, if the Managing General Partner contributes 25% of the   
total Partnership Capital Contributions and the Participants contribute 75% of  
the total Partnership Capital Contributions, then the Managing General Partner  
shall receive 32% of the Partnership revenues and the Participants shall receive
68% of the Partnership revenues. On the other hand, if the Managing General     
Partner contributes 30% of the total Partnership Capital Contributions and the  
Participants contribute 70% of the total Partnership Capital Contributions, then
the Managing General Partner shall receive 35% of the Partnership revenues, not 
37%, because its revenue share cannot exceed 35% of Partnership revenues, and   
the Participants shall receive 65% of Partnership revenues.                     

5.01(b)(4)(a). Subordination. The Managing General Partner shall subordinate    
up to 50% of its share of Partnership Net Production Revenues to the receipt    
by Participants of cash distributions from the Partnership equal to $1,000 per  
Unit (which is 10% per Unit) regardless of their actual subscription price of   
the Units, in each of the first five 12-month periods beginning with the        
Partnership's first cash distributions from operations. In this regard:         

   (i)    the 60-month subordination period shall begin with the first
           cash distribution from operations to the Participants, but no
      subordination distributions to the Participants shall be
             required until the Partnership's first cash distribution to the
         Participants after substantially all Partnership wells have
          been drilled, completed, and placed in production in a sales
line;                                             

37

P-->EX-440th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
(ii)   subsequent subordination distributions, if any, shall be 
             determined and made at the time of each subsequent distribution
of revenues to the Participants; and              

   (iii)  the Managing General Partner shall not subordinate more than
            50% of its share of Partnership Net Production Revenues in any
subordination period.                             

The subordination shall be determined by:                                       

     (i)    carrying forward to subsequent 12-month periods the amount, if
          any, by which cumulative cash distributions to Participants,
  including any subordination payments, are less than:

          (a)     $1,000 per Unit (10% per Unit) in the first 12-month
period;                           

           (b)     $2,000 per Unit (20% per Unit) in the second 12-month
period;                           

          (c)     $3,000 per Unit (30% per Unit) in the third 12-month
period; or                        

           (d)     $4,000 per Unit (40% per Unit) in the fourth 12-month
          period (no carry forward is required if such
                  distributions are less than $5,000 per Unit (50% per
                     Unit) in the fifth 12-month period because the Managing
                      General Partner's subordination obligation terminates on
               the expiration of the fifth 12-month period); and

(ii)   reimbursing the Managing General Partner for any previous
  subordination payments to the extent cumulative cash
        distributions to Participants, including any subordination
payments, would exceed:                           

          (a)     $1,000 per Unit (10% per Unit) in the first 12-month
period;                           

           (b)     $2,000 per Unit (20% per Unit) in the second 12-month
period;                           

          (c)     $3,000 per Unit (30% per Unit) in the third 12-month
period;                           

           (d)     $4,000 per Unit (40% per Unit) in the fourth 12-month
period; or                        

          (e)     $5,000 per Unit (50% per Unit) in the fifth 12-month
period.                           

The Managing General Partner's subordination obligation shall be further        
subject to the following conditions:                                            

   (i)    the subordination obligation may be prorated in the Managing
           General Partner's discretion (e.g. in the case of a quarterly
          distribution, the Managing General Partner will not have any
           subordination obligation if the distributions to Participants
           equal $250 per Unit (25% of $1,000 per Unit per year) or more
       assuming there is no subordination owed for any preceding
period);                                          

   (ii)   the Managing General Partner shall not be required to return
       Partnership distributions previously received by it, even
though a subordination obligation arises after the
distributions;                                    

(iii)  subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, only
           Partnership revenues in the current distribution period shall
           be debited or credited to the Managing General Partner as may
            be necessary to provide, to the extent possible, subordination
         distributions to the Participants and reimbursements to the
Managing General Partner;                         

      (iv)   no subordination payments to the Participants or reimbursements
     to the Managing General Partner shall be made after the
        expiration of the fifth 12-month subordination period; and

38

P-->EX-441st�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
     (v)    subordination payments to the Participants shall be subject to
             any lien or priority required by the Managing General Partner's
       lenders pursuant to agreements previously entered into or
          subsequently entered into or renewed by the Managing General
Partner.                                          

5.01(b)(5). Commingling of Revenues From All Partnership Wells. The revenues    
from all Partnership wells will be commingled, so regardless of when a          
Participant subscribes he will share in the revenues from all wells on the      
same basis as the other Participants.                                           

5.01(c). Allocations.                                                           

5.01(c)(1). Allocations among Participants. Except as provided otherwise in     
this Agreement, costs (other than Intangible Drilling Costs and Tangible        
Costs) and revenues charged or credited to the Participants as a group, which   
includes all revenue credited to the Participants under ss.5.01(b)(4), shall    
be allocated among the Participants, including the Managing General Partner to  
the extent of any optional subscription under ss.3.03(b)(2), in the ratio of    
their respective Units based on $10,000 per Unit regardless of the actual       
subscription price for a Participant's Units.                                   

Intangible Drilling Costs and Tangible Costs charged to the Participants as a   
group shall be allocated among the Participants, including the Managing         
General Partner to the extent of any optional subscription under                
ss.3.03(b)(2), in the ratio of the subscription price designated on their       
respective Subscription Agreements rather than the number of their respective   
Units.                                                                          

5.01(c)(2). Costs and Revenues Not Directly Allocable to a Partnership Well.    
Costs and revenues not directly allocable to a particular Partnership Well or   
additional operation shall be allocated among the Partnership Wells or          
additional operations in any manner the Managing General Partner in its         
reasonable discretion, shall select, and shall then be charged or credited in   
the same manner as costs or revenues directly applicable to the Partnership     
Well or additional operation are being charged or credited.                     

5.01(c)(3). Managing General Partner's Discretion in Making Allocations For     
Federal Income Tax Purposes. In determining the proper method of allocating     
charges or credits among the parties, or in making any other allocations under  
this Agreement, the Managing General Partner may adopt any method of allocation 
which it, in its reasonable discretion, selects, if, in its sole discretion     
based on advice from its legal counsel or accountants, a revision to the        
allocations is required for the allocations to be recognized for federal income 
tax purposes either because of the promulgation of Treasury Regulations or other
developments in the tax law. Any new allocation provisions shall be provided by 
an amendment to this Agreement and shall be made in a manner that would result  
in the most favorable aggregate consequences to the Participants as nearly as   
possible consistent with the original allocations described in this Agreement.  

5.02. Capital Accounts and Allocations Thereto.                                 

5.02(a). Capital Accounts for Each Party to the Agreement. A single, separate   
Capital Account shall be established for each party, regardless of the number   
of interests owned by the party, the class of the interests and the time or     
manner in which the interests were acquired.                                    

5.02(b). Charges and Credits.

the Capital Account of each party shall be determined and maintained in         
accordance with Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv) and shall be increased by:     

 (i)    the amount of money contributed by him to the Partnership;

    (ii)   the fair market value of property contributed by him, without
          regard to ss.7701(g) of the Code, to the Partnership, net of
      liabilities secured by the contributed property that the
          Partnership is considered to assume or take subject to under
ss.752 of the Code; and                           

39

P-->EX-442nd�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
  (iii)  allocations to him of Partnership income and gain, or items
           thereof, including income and gain exempt from tax and income
            and gain described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(g), but
          excluding income and gain described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-
l(b)(4)(i);                                       

and shall be decreased by:                                                      

 (iv)   the amount of money distributed to him by the Partnership;

    (v)    the fair market value of property distributed to him, without
          regard to ss.7701(g) of the Code, by the Partnership, net of

         considered to assume or take subject to under ss.752 of the
Code;                                             

  (vi)   allocations to him of Partnership expenditures described in
ss.705(a)(2)(B) of the Code; and                  

     (vii)  allocations to him of Partnership loss and deduction, or items
            thereof, including loss and deduction described in Treas. Reg.
            ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(g), but excluding items described in (vi)
             above, and loss or deduction described in Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-
l(b)(4)(i) or (iii).                              

5.02(b)(2). Exception. If Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv) fails to provide     
guidance, Capital Account adjustments shall be made in a manner that:           

 (i)    maintains equality between the aggregate governing Capital
           Accounts of the parties and the amount of Partnership capital
           reflected on the Partnership's balance sheet, as computed for
book purposes;                                    

    (ii)   is consistent with the underlying economic arrangement of the
parties; and                                      

(iii)  is based, wherever practicable, on federal tax accounting
principles.                                       

5.02(c). Payments to the Managing General Partner. The Capital Account of the   
Managing General Partner shall be reduced by payments to it pursuant to         
ss.4.04(a)(2) only to the extent of the Managing General Partner's              
distributive share of any Partnership deduction, loss, or other downward        
Capital Account adjustment resulting from the payments.                         

5.02(d). Discretion of Managing General Partner in the Method of Maintaining    
Capital Accounts. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, the   
method of maintaining Capital Accounts may be changed from time to time, in     
the discretion of the Managing General Partner, to take into consideration      
ss.704 and other provisions of the Code and the related rules, regulations and  
interpretations as may exist from time to time.                                 

5.02(e). Revaluations of Property. In the discretion of the Managing General    
Partner the Capital Accounts of the parties may be increased or decreased to    
reflect a revaluation of Partnership property, including intangible assets      
such as goodwill, on a property-by-property basis except as otherwise           
permitted under ss.704(c) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, on the    
Partnership's books, in accordance with Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(f).    

5.02(f). Amount of Book Items. In cases where ss.704(c) of the Code or          
ss.5.02(e) applies, Capital Accounts shall be adjusted in accordance with       
Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-l(b)(2)(iv)(g) for allocations of depreciation,            
depletion, amortization and gain and loss, as computed for book purposes, with  
respect to the property.                                                        

5.03. Allocation of Income, Deductions and Credits.                             

5.03(a). In General.                                                            

5.03(a)(1). Deductions Are Allocated to Party Charged with Expenditure. To the  
extent permitted by law and except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,     
all deductions and credits, including, but not limited to, intangible drilling  
and development costs and depreciation, shall be allocated to the party who     
has been charged with the expenditure giving rise to the deductions and         
credits; and to the extent permitted by law, these parties shall be entitled    
to the deductions and credits in computing taxable income or tax liabilities    
to the exclusion of any other party. Also, any Partnership deductions that      
would be                                                                        
40

P-->EX-443rd�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
nonrecourse deductions if they were not attributable to a loan made             
or guaranteed by the Managing General Partner or its Affiliates shall be        
allocated to the Managing General Partner to the extent required by law.        

5.03(a)(2). Income and Gain Allocated in Accordance With Revenues. Except as    
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all items of income and gain, including   
gain on disposition of assets, shall be allocated in accordance with the        
related revenue allocations set forth in ss.5.01(b) and its subsections.        

5.03(b). Tax Basis of Each Property. Subject to ss.704(c) of the Code, the tax  
basis of each oil and gas property for computation of cost depletion and gain   
or loss on disposition shall be allocated and reallocated when necessary based  
on the capital interest in the Partnership as to the property and the capital   
interest in the Partnership for this purpose as to each property shall be       
considered to be owned by the parties in the ratio in which the expenditure     
giving rise to the tax basis of the property has been charged as of the end of  
the year.                                                                       

5.03(c). Gain or Loss on Oil and Gas Properties. Each party shall separately    
compute its gain or loss on the disposition of each natural gas and oil         
property in accordance with the provisions of ss.613A(c)(7)D) of the Code, and  
the calculation of the gain or loss shall consider the party's adjusted basis   
in his property interest computed as provided in ss.5.03(b) and the party's     
allocable share of the amount realized from the disposition of the property.    

5.03(d). Gain on Depreciable Property. Gain from each sale or other             
disposition of depreciable property shall be allocated to each party whose      
share of the proceeds from the sale or other disposition exceeds its            
contribution to the adjusted basis of the property in the ratio that the        
excess bears to the sum of the excesses of all parties having an excess.        

5.03(e). Loss on Depreciable Property. Loss from each sale, abandonment or      
other disposition of depreciable property shall be allocated to each party      
whose contribution to the adjusted basis of the property exceeds its share of   
the proceeds from the sale, abandonment or other disposition in the proportion  
that the excess bears to the sum of the excesses of all parties having an       
excess.                                                                         

5.03(f). Allocation If Recapture Treated As Ordinary Income. Any recapture      
treated as an increase in ordinary income by reason of ss.ss.1245, 1250, or 1254
of the Code shall be allocated to the parties in the amounts in which the       
recaptured items were previously allocated to them; provided that to the extent 
recapture allocated to any party is in excess of the party's gain from the      
disposition of the property, the excess shall be allocated to the other parties 
but only to the extent of the other parties' gain from the disposition of the   
property.                                                                       

5.03(g). Tax Credits. As of the date of the Prospectus, tax credits are not     
available to the Partnership. If this changes in the future, however, and if a  
Partnership expenditure, whether or not deductible, that gives rise to a tax    
credit in a Partnership taxable year also gives rise to valid allocations of    
Partnership loss or deduction, or other downward Capital Account adjustments,   
for the year, then the parties' interests in the Partnership with respect to    
the credit, or the cost giving rise thereto, shall be in the same proportion    
as the parties' respective distributive shares of the loss or deduction, and    
adjustments. Identical principles shall apply in determining the parties'       
interests in the Partnership with respect to tax credits that arise from        
receipts of the Partnership, whether or not taxable.                            

5.03(h). Deficit Capital Accounts and Qualified Income Offset. Notwithstanding  
any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, an allocation of loss or      
deduction which would result in a party having a deficit Capital Account        
balance as of the end of the taxable year to which the allocation relates, if   
charged to the party, to the extent the Participant is not required to restore  
the deficit to the Partnership, taking into account:                            

  (i)    adjustments that, as of the end of the year, reasonably are
    expected to be made to the party's Capital Account for
            depletion allowances with respect to the Partnership's natural
gas and oil properties;                           

   (ii)   allocations of loss and deduction that, as of the end of the
         year, reasonably are expected to be made to the party under
    ss.ss.704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code and Treas. Reg.
ss.1.751-1(b)(2)(ii); and                         

41

P-->EX-444th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
    (iii)  distributions that, as of the end of the year, reasonably are
        expected to be made to the party to the extent they exceed
           offsetting increases to the party's Capital Account, assuming
        for this purpose that the fair market value of Partnership
         property equals its adjusted tax basis, that reasonably are
          expected to occur during or prior to the Partnership taxable
            years in which the distributions reasonably are expected to be
made;                                             

shall be charged to the Managing General Partner. Further, the Managing         
General Partner shall be credited with an additional amount of Partnership      
income or gain equal to the amount of the loss or deduction as quickly as       
possible to the extent such chargeback does not cause or increase deficit       
balances in the parties' Capital Accounts which are not required to be          
restored to the Partnership.                                                    

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Agreement to the contrary, if a party    
unexpectedly receives an adjustment, allocation, or distribution described in   
(i), (ii), or (iii) above, or any other distribution, which causes or           
increases a deficit balance in the party's Capital Account which is not         
required to be restored to the Partnership, the party shall be allocated items  
of income and gain, consisting of a pro rata portion of each item of            
Partnership income, including gross income, and gain for the year, in an        
amount and manner sufficient to eliminate the deficit balance as quickly as     
possible.                                                                       

5.03(i). Minimum Gain Chargeback. To the extent there is a net decrease during  
a Partnership taxable year in the minimum gain attributable to a Partner        
nonrecourse debt, then any Partner with a share of the minimum gain             
attributable to the debt at the beginning of the year shall be allocated items  
of Partnership income and gain in accordance with Treas. Reg. ss.1.704-2(i).    

5.03(j). Partners' Allocable Shares. Except as otherwise provided in this       
Agreement, each party's allocable share of Partnership income, gain, loss,      
deductions and credits shall be determined by the use of any method prescribed  
or permitted by the Secretary of the Treasury by regulations or other           
guidelines and selected by the Managing General Partner which takes into        
account the varying interests of the parties in the Partnership during the      
taxable year. In the absence of such regulations or guidelines, except as       
otherwise provided in this Agreement, the allocable share shall be based on     
actual income, gain, loss, deductions and credits economically accrued each     
day during the taxable year in proportion to each party's varying interest in   
the Partnership on each day during the taxable year.                            

5.04. Elections.                                                                

5.04(a). Election to Deduct Intangible Costs. The Partnership's federal income  
tax return shall be made in accordance with an election under the option        
granted by the Code to deduct intangible drilling and development costs.        

5.04(b). No Election Out of Subchapter K. No election shall be made by the      
Partnership, any Partner, or the Operator for the Partnership to be excluded    
from the application of the partnership provisions of Subchapter K of the       
Code.                                                                           

5.04(c). Contingent Income. If it is determined that any taxable income         
results to any party by reason of its entitlement to a share of profits or      
revenues of the Partnership before the profit or revenue has been realized by   
the Partnership, the resulting deduction as well as any resulting gain, shall   
not enter into Partnership net income or loss but shall be separately           
allocated to the party.                                                         

5.04(d). ss.754 Election. In the event of the transfer of an interest in the    
Partnership, or on the death of an individual party hereto, or in the event of  
the distribution of property to any party, the Managing General Partner may     
choose for the Partnership to file an election in accordance with the           
applicable Treasury Regulations to cause the basis of the Partnership's assets  
to be adjusted for federal income tax purposes as provided by ss.ss.734 and     
743 of the Code.                                                                

5.05. Distributions.                                                            

5.05(a). In General.                                                            

5.05(a)(1). Quarterly Review of Accounts. The Managing General Partner shall    
review the accounts of the Partnership at least quarterly to determine whether  
cash distributions are appropriate and the amount to be distributed, if any.    

42

P-->EX-445th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
5.05(a)(2). Distributions. The Partnership shall distribute funds to the        
Managing General Partner and the Participants allocated to their accounts       
which the Managing General Partner deems unnecessary to retain by the           
Partnership.                                                                    

5.05(a)(3). No Borrowings. In no event, however, shall funds be advanced or     
borrowed for distributions if the amount of the distributions would exceed the  
Partnership's accrued and received revenues for the previous four quarters,     
less paid and accrued Operating Costs with respect to the revenues. The         
determination of revenues and costs shall be made in accordance with generally  
accepted accounting principles, consistently applied.                           

5.05(a)(4). Distributions to the Managing General Partner. Cash distributions   
from the Partnership to the Managing General Partner shall only be made as      
follows:                                                                        

(a)    in conjunction with distributions to Participants; and   

(b)    out of funds properly allocated to the Managing General  
Partner's account.                                

5.05(a)(5). Reserve. At any time after one year from the date each Partnership  
Well is placed into production, the Managing General Partner shall have the     
right to deduct each month from the Partnership's proceeds of the sale of the   
production from the well up to $200 for the purpose of establishing a fund to   
cover the estimated costs of plugging and abandoning the well. All of these     
funds shall be deposited in a separate interest bearing account for the         
benefit of the Partnership, and the total amount so retained and deposited      
shall not exceed the Managing General Partner's reasonable estimate of the      
costs.                                                                          

5.05(b). Distribution of Uncommitted Subscription Proceeds. Any net subscription
proceeds not expended or committed for expenditure, as evidenced by a written   
agreement, by the Partnership within 12 months of the Offering Termination Date,
except necessary operating capital, shall be distributed to the Participants in 
the ratio that the subscription price designated on each Participant's          
Subscription Agreement bears to the total subscription prices designated on all 
of the Participants' Subscription Agreements, as a return of capital. The       
Managing General Partner shall reimburse the Participants for the selling or    
other offering expenses allocable to the return of capital.                     

For purposes of this subsection, "committed for expenditure" shall mean         
contracted for, actually earmarked for or allocated by the Managing General     
Partner to the Partnership's drilling operations, and "necessary operating      
capital" shall mean those funds which, in the opinion of the Managing General   
Partner, should remain on hand to assure continuing operation of the            
Partnership.                                                                    

5.05(c). Distributions on Winding Up. On the winding up of the Partnership      
distributions shall be made as provided in ss.7.02.                             

5.05(d). Interest and Return of Capital. No party shall under any               
circumstances be entitled to any interest on amounts retained by the            
Partnership. Each Participant shall look only to his share of distributions,    
if any, from the Partnership for a return of his Capital Contribution.

6.01(b)(1). Automatic Conversion. After all of the Partnership Wells have

6.01(b)(2). Investor General Partners Shall Have Contingent Liability. On

affect the allocation to any Participant of any item of Partnership income,     
gain, loss, deduction or credit or other item of special tax significance       
other than Partnership liabilities, if any. Further, the conversion shall not   
affect any Participant's interest in the Partnership's natural gas and oil

foregoing, the Managing General Partner shall notify all Participants at least  
30 days before the effective date of any adverse material change in the

materially reduced, then the Investor General Partners shall have the right to  
convert their Units into Limited Partner Units before the reduction by giving   
written notice to the Managing General Partner.

   (i)    only whole Units may be assigned unless the Participant owns

    (ii)   the costs and expenses associated with the assignment must be

6.02(a)(1). Tax Law Restrictions. Subject to transfers permitted by ss.6.04     
and transfers by operation of law, no sale, assignment, exchange, or transfer

ss.6.04 and transfers by operation of law, no Unit shall be sold, assigned,

Partnership, would result in the violation of any applicable federal or state   
securities laws.

6.02(a)(3)(a). Procedure to Become Substitute Participant. Subject to           
ss.ss.6.02(a)(1) and 6.02(a)(2), an assignee of a Participant's Unit shall      
become a substituted Participant entitled to all the rights of a Participant    
if, and only if:                                                                

(i)    the assignor gives the assignee the right;               

  (ii)   the assignee pays to the Partnership all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the substitution; and 

      (iii)  the assignee executes and delivers the instruments necessary to
            establish that a legal transfer has taken place and to confirm
           the agreement of the assignee to be bound by all of the terms
of this Agreement.                                

6.02(a)(3)(b). Rights of Substitute Participant. A substitute Participant is    
entitled to all of the rights attributable to full ownership of the assigned    
Units including the right to vote.                                              

6.02(b).       Effect of Transfer.                                              

6.02(b)(1). Amendment of Records. The Partnership shall amend its records at    
least once each calendar quarter to effect the substitution of substituted      
Participants.                                                                   

Any transfer permitted under this Agreement when the assignee does not become   
a substituted Participant shall be effective as follows:                        

    (i)    midnight of the last day of the calendar month in which it is
made; or                                          

   (ii)   at the Managing General Partner's election, 7:00 A.M. of the
following day.                                    

6.02(b)(2). Transfer Does Not Relieve Transferor of Certain Costs. No           
transfer, including a transfer of less than all of a Participant's Units or     
the transfer of Units to more than one party, shall relieve the transferor of   
its responsibility for its proportionate part of any expenses, obligations and  
liabilities under this Agreement related to the Units so transferred, whether   
arising before or after the transfer.                                           

6.02(b)(3). Transfer Does Not Require An Accounting. No transfer of a Unit      
shall require an accounting by the Managing General Partner. Also, no transfer  
shall grant rights under this Agreement, including the exercise of any          
elections, as between the transferring parties and the remaining parties to     
this Agreement to more than one party unanimously designated by the             
transferees and, if he should have retained an interest under this Agreement,   
the transferor.                                                                 

6.02(b)(4). Notice. Until the Managing General Partner receives a proper        
notice of designation acceptable to it, the Managing General Partner shall      
continue to account only to the person to whom it was furnishing notices        
before the time pursuant to ss.8.01 and its subsections. This party shall       
continue to exercise all rights applicable to the Units previously owned by     
the transferor.

Interests. The Managing General Partner shall have the authority without the    
consent of the Participants and without affecting the allocation of costs and

otherwise encumber, on any terms it chooses for its own general purposes        
either:                                                                         

(i)    its Partnership interest; or                             

      (ii)   an undivided interest in the assets of the Partnership equal to
         or less than its respective interest in the revenues of the
Partnership.                                      

45  

P-->EX-448th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
All repayments of these borrowings and costs, interest or other charges         
related to the borrowings shall be borne and paid separately by the Managing    
General Partner. In no event shall the repayments, costs, interest, or other    
charges related to the borrowing be charged to the account of the               
Participants.                                                                   

In addition, subject to a required participation of not less than 1% in the     
Partnership as Managing General Partner, the Managing General Partner may       
withdraw a property interest held by the Partnership in the form of a Working   
Interest in the Partnership Wells equal to or less than its respective          
interest in the revenues of the Partnership if:                                 

      (i)    the withdrawal is necessary to satisfy the bona fide request of
its creditors; or                                 

     (ii)   the withdrawal is approved by Participants whose Units equal a
majority of the total Units.                      

6.04. Presentment.                                                              

6.04(a). In General. Participants shall have the right to present their         
interests to the Managing General Partner for purchase subject to the           
conditions and limitations set forth in this section. A Participant, however,   
is not obligated to present his Units for purchase.                             

The Managing General Partner shall not be obligated to purchase more than 5%    
of the Units in any calendar year and this 5% limit may not be waived. The      
Managing General Partner shall not purchase less than one Unit unless the       
lesser amount represents the Participant's entire interest in the Partnership,  
however, the Managing General Partner may waive this limitation.                

A Participant may present his Units in writing to the Managing General Partner  
every year beginning with the fifth calendar year after the Offering            
Termination Date subject to the following conditions:                           

  (i)    the presentment must be made within 120 days of the reserve
report set forth in ss.4.03(b)(3);                

      (ii)   in accordance with Treas. Reg. ss.1.7704-1(f), the purchase may
   not be made until at least 60 calendar days after the
    Participant notifies the Partnership in writing of the
            Participant's intention to exercise the presentment right; and

(iii)  the purchase shall not be considered effective until the 
         presentment price has been paid in cash to the Participant.

6.04(b). Requirement for Independent Petroleum Consultant. The amount of the    
presentment price attributable to Partnership reserves shall be determined      
based on the last reserve report of the Partnership prepared by the Managing    
General Partner and reviewed by an Independent Expert. The Managing General     
Partner shall estimate the present worth of future net revenues attributable    
to the Partnership's interest in the Proved Reserves. In making this estimate,  
the Managing General Partner shall use the following terms:                     

(i)    a discount rate equal to 10%;                            

(ii)   a constant price for the oil; and                        

(iii)  base the price of natural gas on the existing natural gas
contracts at the time of the purchase.            

The calculation of the presentment price shall be as set forth in ss.6.04(c).   

6.04(c). Calculation of Presentment Price. The presentment price shall be       
based on the Participant's share of the net assets and liabilities of the       
Partnership and allocated pro rata to each Participant in the ratio that his    
number of Units bears to the total number of Units. The presentment price       
shall include the sum of the following Partnership items:                       

46

P-->EX-449th�Page�of�52TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
(i)    an amount based on 70% of the present worth of future net
          revenues from the Proved Reserves determined as described in
ss.6.04(b);                                       

(ii)   cash on hand;                                            

 (iii)  prepaid expenses and accounts receivable less a reasonable
amount for doubtful accounts; and                 

(iv)   the estimated market value of all assets, not separately 
     specified above, determined in accordance with standard
industry valuation procedures.                    

There shall be deducted from the foregoing sum the following items:             

(i)    an amount equal to all debts, obligations, and other     
liabilities, including accrued expenses; and      

     (ii)   any distributions made to the Participants between the date of
      the request and the actual payment. However, if any cash
          distributed was derived from the sale, after the presentment
             request, of natural gas, oil or other mineral production, or of
            a producing property owned by the Partnership, for purposes of
     determining the reduction of the presentment price, the
             distributions shall be discounted at the same rate used to take
             into account the risk factors employed to determine the present
worth of the Partnership's Proved Reserves.       

6.04(d). Further Adjustment May Be Allowed. The presentment price may be        
further adjusted by the Managing General Partner for estimated changes therein  
from the date of the report to the date of payment of the presentment price to  
the Participants because of the following:                                      

(i)     the production or sales of, or additions to, reserves and lease and     
  well equipment, sale or abandonment of Leases, and similar matters
occurring before the request for purchase; and                  

(ii)    any of the following occurring before payment of the presentment price  
to the selling Participants:                                    

(a)     changes in well performance;              

           (b)     increases or decreases in the market price of natural
gas, oil or other minerals;       

          (c)     revision of regulations relating to the importing of
hydrocarbons;                     

            (d)     changes in income, ad valorem, and other tax laws such
                     as material variations in the provisions for depletion;
and                               

(e)     similar matters.                          

6.04(e). Selection by Lot. If less than all Units presented at any time are to  
be purchased, then the Participants whose Units are to be purchased will be     
selected by lot.                                                                

The Managing General Partner's obligation to purchase Units presented may be    
discharged for its benefit by a third-party or an Affiliate. The Units of the   
selling Participant will be transferred to the party who pays for it. A         
selling Participant will be required to deliver an executed assignment of his   
Units, together with any other documentation as the Managing General Partner    
may reasonably request.                                                         

6.04(f). No Obligation of the Managing General Partner to Establish a Reserve.  
The Managing General Partner shall have no obligation to establish any reserve  
to satisfy the presentment obligations under this section.                      

6.04(g). Suspension of Presentment Feature. The Managing General Partner may    
suspend this presentment feature by so notifying Participants at any time if    
it:                                                                             

47

(i)  does not have sufficient cash flow; or                           

(ii) is unable to borrow funds for this purpose on terms it deems     
reasonable.                                                 

In addition, the presentment feature may be conditioned, in the Managing        
General Partner's sole discretion, on the Managing General Partner's receipt    
of an opinion of counsel that the transfers will not cause the Partnership to   
be treated as a "publicly traded partnership" under the Code.                   

The Managing General Partner shall hold the purchased Units for its own         
account and not for resale.

(i)    a Final Terminating Event; or

7.01(c). Continuance of Partnership Except on Final Terminating Event. Other    
than the occurrence of a Final Terminating Event, the Partnership or any

      (i)    the Managing General Partner offers the individual Participants
          the election of receiving in-kind property distributions and
          the Participants accept the offer after being advised of the
risks associated with direct ownership; or        

   (ii)   there are alternative arrangements in place which assure the
          Participants that they will not, at any time, be responsible
         for the operation or disposition of Partnership properties.

If the Managing General Partner has not received a Participant's consent        
within 30 days after the Managing General Partner mailed the request for        
consent, then it shall be presumed that the Participant has refused his         
consent.

from an independent third-party, who is not an Affiliate of the Managing        
General Partner or to itself or its Affiliates, including an Affiliated Income  
Program, at fair market value as determined by an Independent Expert selected   
by the Managing General Partner.

Get Quote Apply Online








For international travel, Atlas Travel® Insurance provides customizable coverage for travelers looking to cover specific needs while abroad.
International travel can represent financial risk. The benefits of many standard medical insurance policies do not apply beyond the borders of your home country. An Atlas Travel® Insurance
                                        plan can be the difference between a trip ruined by unexpected illness or injury, versus a trip with access to quality care and financial help if the unexpected strikes.
HCC has developed two Atlas Travel® plans that offer a complete package of international benefits available 24 hours a day. Atlas America® provides coverage for non-U.S. citizens traveling outside their home country while Atlas International provides coverage for US citizens traveling outside their home country.
Important things you should know about Atlas Visitors Insurance
There are many different types of insurance policies that are around today, but one of the best ones you can try out is the Atlas America Visitor Insurance policy. The medical insurance policy is available to visitors in the United States, as well as all foreign tourists who are traveling to the United States for business or for leisure. There is massive demand for this travel insurance package, because it is available for new immigrants in the United States, as well as international students, and overseas travelers as well.

Does Atlas Travel® provide any coverage while I am in my home country?
Atlas Travel® does offer medical expense coverage in your home country in the following situations:

                                                Benefit Period –Atlas Travel® will cover eligible medical expenses in the member’s home country for 90 days after the beginning of treatment so long as the related illness or injury began while the certificate was still in effect and treatment began while the member was outside their home country.

                                                Incidental Home Country Coverage – For U.S. citizens, medical expenses are only covered during incidental trips home totaling no more than 15 days per three-month period of coverage. Incidental visit time must be used within the three-month period earned, and the member must continue his or her international trip in order to be eligible for this benefit. Medical expenses for non-U.S. citizens will be covered up to a maximum of 30 days for any three-month period. Medical expenses incurred in your home country will not be covered if your purpose for returning to your home country is to obtain treatment of an illness or injury that began while traveling. 
Will Atlas Travel® cover me on trips of a year or longer?
For non-U.S. citizens or residents whose travel does not include the U.S. or U.S. territories, the maximum coverage duration is 365 days. Additionally, coverage may be renewed up to 2 additional coverage periods. Coverage renewal requires satisfaction of a new deductible and coinsurance. Renewals may be filed through the Client Zone.
                                                For all other travelers, the maximum duration is 364 days, and coverage is not renewable. 
How do I cancel my Atlas Travel® coverage?
You may submit a written cancellation request to HCCMIS prior to the effective date of coverage for a full refund. If HCCMIS receives the cancellation request following the effective date of coverage, only the unused portion of premium will be refunded. A $25 cancellation fee will apply.
Will Atlas Travel® cover multiple trips? 
No. Atlas Travel® coverage is purchased for a duration you specify and applies to a single trip only. For coverage that applies to multiple trips, our Atlas MultiTrip™ product may work for you. 
Are there any countries not covered in my Atlas Travel® plan? 
Yes. Certain travel restrictions declared by the U.S. State Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and certain OFAC sanctions, affect Atlas Travel® coverage.
