FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]
SunEdison companies[edit]

SunEdison, Inc.




SunEdison's solar materials group produces granular polysilicon, silicon-crystal ingots, silicon wafers, and specifies the production of solar cells and solar modules. It produces granular polysilicon in purities usable in the solar and semiconductor industries. The granular polysilicon is produced in Pasadena, Texas, and, through a joint venture with Samsung and SunEdison Semiconductor, in Ulsan, Korea. The granular silicon is used for SunEdison's own silicon-crystal manufacturing, and for sales to third-party solar and semiconductor crystal-manufacturing companies. The division also has a plant in Portland, Oregon acquired from Solaicx in 2010, which produces silicon-crystal ingots using the "continuous crystal growth" technology, enabling the production of low-cost wafers for high-efficiency solar cells. The ingots are sliced into wafers in Malaysia. SunEdison and its subsidiaries and joint-venture partners also manufacture the solar cells used in its modules. Its solar modules are assembled by contract manufacturers in Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea, and China which use SunEdison technology, meet SunEdison's strict specifications, and use SunEdison's quality control systems.

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]
SunEdison companies[edit]

SunEdison, Inc.




SunEdison's solar materials group produces granular polysilicon, silicon-crystal ingots, silicon wafers, and specifies the production of solar cells and solar modules. It produces granular polysilicon in purities usable in the solar and semiconductor industries. The granular polysilicon is produced in Pasadena, Texas, and, through a joint venture with Samsung and SunEdison Semiconductor, in Ulsan, Korea. The granular silicon is used for SunEdison's own silicon-crystal manufacturing, and for sales to third-party solar and semiconductor crystal-manufacturing companies. The division also has a plant in Portland, Oregon acquired from Solaicx in 2010, which produces silicon-crystal ingots using the "continuous crystal growth" technology, enabling the production of low-cost wafers for high-efficiency solar cells. The ingots are sliced into wafers in Malaysia. SunEdison and its subsidiaries and joint-venture partners also manufacture the solar cells used in its modules. Its solar modules are assembled by contract manufacturers in Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea, and China which use SunEdison technology, meet SunEdison's strict specifications, and use SunEdison's quality control systems.

66% reduction in cost of wind energy
Wind Power

Change is in the air thanks to significant declines in the cost of wind energy. Recent advances in design mean that today’s wind turbines are converting a higher amount of wind into wind energy. And that has reduced the cost of wind energy by an impressive 66 percent since 2009.*
 
This has led to significant growth in wind capacity across America and the world. For example, fully one-quarter of all new electric-generating capacity added in the US in 2014 came from wind power, bringing the nation’s total installed wind capacity to almost 66 GW. That’s enough energy to power over 17 million homes.*
 
At SunEdison we’re doing our part to lead this important shift to clean, affordable renewable energy, not just in the US but also around the world. The world of energy is on the cusp of major change. People everywhere are seeking an alternative to conventional fossil fuels. Our commitment to solar and wind energy means we are ready to meet those changing needs, whichever way the wind blows.

Go big and stay home
Wind Power
In the sprawling deserts of Utah you will find the state’s largest wind farm. SunEdison’s Milford Wind project generates a staggering 306 MW of clean power. Since its completion in 2011, this facility has generated close to 3 million megawatt hours of clean, renewable electricity. To produce the same amount of energy, a coal-fired plant would have had to burn 1.5 million tons of coal.
 
Pictured here is SunEdison project manager Bill Dent, who is about to scale the inside of one of the 150-foot-tall turbines. There are 168 of them onsite. That’s why Bill and his team of almost 30 full-time employees have made Milford and the surrounding area their home. That way, with the help of SunEdison’s Remote Operations Centers, they can monitor and maintain the facility 24 hours a day, all year round.
 
Because when you build something big enough to supply energy for 60,000 homes, right in your own backyard, you want to make sure it keeps working just the way it was designed to.

Old ideas, new technology
Wind Power
For thousands of years, human ingenuity has created technologies to harness the power of the wind. But to meet the growing energy needs of a rapidly expanding global population, traditional methods need a little boost from modern technology.
 
At SunEdison we’re committed to bringing the latest technology to the world of renewable energy. That’s why our wind farms utilize the most advanced turbines, capable of transforming even a light breeze into clean electricity.
 
The old windmill pictured here stands only a little ways away from one of our wind farms, the 306 MW project near Milford, Utah. And it serves as a reminder that sometimes the simplest ideas are the best.

Clean energy on a grand scale
Solar Solutions
This 25 MW utility-scale solar project, built by SunEdison, sits in the sprawling sundrenched Avra Valley northwest of Tucson, Arizona. It generates enough clean energy to power 3,500 homes and will do so for decades to come. And each year that it operates it will save approximately 30 million gallons of water that would otherwise have been needed for fossil fuel generated electricity. In addition, the CO2 reductions achieved by the Avra Valley project are equivalent to taking over 9,000 cars off the road.
 
This is only one of dozens of utility scale projects SunEdison has built or operates around the world, which together generate over 6 gigawatts of energy.

400 years of community spirit
Solar Solutions
In the early 1600s, when the Pilgrims settled the town of Bourne, Massachusetts, they were looking to create a community of likeminded individuals. Today, that spirit of community is alive and well. Its latest expression can be found in the town’s innovative “community solar” project, part of a growing trend toward shared renewable energy.
 
Rather than installing individual solar systems on homes and businesses, a larger system is built. People in the community can own or lease a portion of the system (similar to a community garden, where individuals work a plot of land in a larger garden). Not only are larger systems highly cost effective, community solar enables those who might not otherwise be able to enjoy the benefits of solar to do so – for example, apartment dwellers, renters, or people whose homes don’t get enough sunlight.
 
SunEdison is proud to have partnered with the residents of Bourne to develop this pioneering approach to solar energy, and to do so in the same spirit of community that the Pilgrims would have recognized.

$60 million in Utility bill savings
Solar Solutions
Affordable housing demands affordable energy. That’s why 16 public housing authorities across Massachusetts have partnered with SunEdison to purchase solar energy solutions that will deliver an estimated $60 million in savings over the next 20 years.
 
But the benefits are not just economic. CO2 emissions will be reduced by 1 million tons - that’s equivalent to taking some 200,000 cars off the road!
 
All of which means the citizens of Massachusetts can breathe a whole lot easier, knowing that public housing energy costs will be stable and predictable for decades to come, thanks to clean and reliable solar energy.

Zero white space, higher efficiency
Transformative Technology
When it comes to solar panel efficiency, every square millimeter counts. That’s why SunEdison has developed a zero white space (ZWS) high efficiency solar module. By eliminating the unused areas between solar cells, we’ve boosted each panel’s power output by up to 15%.
 
A solar panel that used to produce 350 watts of peak energy can now produce 400. And greater output means greater efficiency. The result is that this new technology can reduce total system cost by up to 8%.
 
Not only is ZWS technology smart and efficient, it looks good too. It turns out that eliminating the unnecessary white space results in a sleek, seamless black surface, perfect for integrating into residential roofs. Who knew?
share







Advanced polysilicon technology at the lowest cost
Transformative Technology
Solar energy is at a tipping point. It’s well on its way to becoming the lowest cost energy solution—not just in comparison to other renewables, but the cost winner over fossil fuels as well.
 
At SunEdison we’re working to bring about this change by developing leading edge technology that will produce the lowest cost polysilicon in the world. Polysilicon is the basic building block of solar cells, and with this step-change in technology, we’re well on the way to producing a 400 watt solar panel at a cost of $0.40 per watt.
 
Our proprietary technology, now in operation at our joint venture facility in Ulsan, Korea, produces ultra pure polysilicon 10 times more efficiently than conventional technologies, using 90% less energy. Low-cost, clean solar energy will transform the way all of us use energy. And it has the power to transform our planet as well.

When catching the wind, bigger is better.
Transformative Technology

Wind turbine technology is climbing to new heights—quite literally. The average power output of newly installed wind turbines in the US has risen 172% in the past 15 years.*
 
This increased power output has been achieved, in part, by building up. The average hub height of new turbines has grown by almost 50%, now reaching over 269 feet. At the same time, the average rotor diameter has more than doubled. Add it all up and wind turbine blades are reaching higher than ever before.*
 
And if you’ve ever climbed to the top of a tall peak, you’ll know the winds get stronger the higher you go.  For wind turbines this means the taller they are, the more wind there is to capture and transform into clean renewable energy.

From Net Zero to infinity
The Future Of Energy
“Net Zero” refers to homes that generate as much energy as they consume. And the energy they generate typically comes from clean solar power. That means the amount of energy they need to draw from conventional sources is exactly zero.
 
SunEdison’s patented hybrid solar system has allowed users to transform their homes into self-sufficient Net Zero buildings. Our system not only generates electricity but also provides solar water heating, solar home heating and solar home cooling – all under one roof.
 
This is only one of many innovative systems we’re developing to take advantage of the virtually infinite power of the sun. In the future, more and more homes will be Net Zero, freeing homeowners from their dependence on centralized power and from the uncertainties of energy pricing.
share







The future is now
The Future Of Energy
The world of solar energy has reached a remarkable moment of transformation, thanks to three converging trends. First, costs have plummeted. And we can confidently predict they will fall even further in the future. We believe that solar will soon become the most cost effective way to produce electricity. In fact, in some parts of the world, it already is.
 
Secondly, the performance of solar panels has risen dramatically – up by 50% in just the last 8 years. And finally, the ability to store the energy produced by solar systems is improving every day, thanks to innovations driven by the automotive industry and electric cars.
 
Taken together, these changes mean that soon more of us will be using the abundant power of the sun to run our homes and our cars. It gives a whole new meaning to the idea that the world revolves around the sun.
share







Growing together
The Future Of Energy
Solar energy is rapidly growing to satisfy more and more of our energy needs. And as the industry grows so is the demand for skilled workers. That’s why SunEdison and GRID Alternatives have launched a US based initiative called RISE, to train new workers and ensure a more inclusive workforce.
 
This initiative provides training for women and those in underserved communities. But the benefits don’t stop there. In addition to providing hands-on training this program also makes solar accessible to low-income families, allowing them to lower their energy costs.
 
As our industry grows, our hope is that everyone will rise with it, especially those who need a little extra help.
share







From 0 to 100 megawatts in 6 months
The Future Of Energy
As the demand for solar energy grows so does the need for rapid deployment. At SunEdison we take special pride in being able to bring large-scale solar projects online quickly and efficiently.
 
Consider our Amanecer Solar CAP plant located in the Atacama Desert in Chile. This sprawling project consists of 310,000 solar photovoltaic (“PV”) panels spread over 250 acres, and generates 100 MW of power. It took less than 6 months to build. By way of comparison, the average coal-fired plant would take 5 years or more to construct.
 
As the pace at which we transform our energy supply to renewable resources speeds up, increasingly the race will go to the swift. And at SunEdison we aim to be at the head of the pack.

Malaysian Airports, INC.Look to the Sky
With 39 airports scattered across thecountry, Malaysian Airports Inc. is looking to the sky to help relieve high energy costs.

Malaysian Airports Look to the Sky
Global Impact
It was natural that when Malaysian Airports needed a way to relieve costly energy bills they turned to the sky, or rather, the sun. And with some creative engineering from SunEdison, the country’s first airport solar system was created at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
 
It was no easy task. With much of the available land dedicated to parking, there was little room for a solar system.
 
A solar parking canopy, which uses solar panels to create covered parking, turned out to be the perfect solution. Today visitors to the airport can park their car in the shade of a canopy that is silently making reliable, economical solar energy. Now that’s what we call practical innovation.

Middle East sees a future rich in solar.
Global Impact
When you think about oil and fossil fuels, the Middle East probably comes to mind. But now even this oil-centric region is looking to SunEdison and a solar future.
 
In Jordan we’re constructing a 23.8 MW solar power plant that will sell electricity to the Jordanian National Electric Power Company (NEPCO). And in Saudi Arabia, where they’ve announced their intention to become a world leader in solar energy, we’re making our advanced silicon technology available to help make this happen.
 
At a conference in May 2015, the Saudi oil minister shared his vision for the future. He said that one day “…instead of exporting fossil fuels, we will be exporting gigawatts of (solar) electric power.”
 
Wow. Solar power is indeed transforming the world of energy.

South Africa
Global Impact
How do you provide a rapidly growing population with affordable energy when you have an antiquated and unreliable power system? You turn to SunEdison and solar power.
 
Our solar power plants generate energy that is cost competitive with fossil fuels. We can bring a new utility scale solar power plant on-line in under six months, whereas a conventional fossil fuel fired power plant typically takes years to build. And as an added benefit, our solar power plants are strategically located to strengthen the utility grid, making the entire system more reliable.
 
With 457 MW of solar power operational or planned in South Africa, we’re set to generate enough clean energy to power an estimated 175,000 homes. And we’re just getting started.
share







India
Global Impact
In July 2015 we signed an agreement with Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, one of the largest utilities in India, to provide 180 megawatts of solar power to the people of New Delhi. That’s enough solar to power over 300,000 Indian homes.
 
“Good things happen when you bring two of India’s largest energy brands together,” said Pashupathy Gopalan, SunEdison president of Asia-Pacific and Sub-Sahara Africa. “The people of new Delhi will benefit from clean, reliable and affordable energy as a result of this project, which makes a direct and powerful contribution towards India’s goal of generating 100 gigawatts of solar power by 2022.”
 
Agreed.

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]

SunEdison, Inc. is a global renewable energy company headquartered in the U.S. In addition to developing, building, owning, and operating solar power plants and wind energy plants, it also manufactures high purity polysilicon, monocrystalline silicon ingots, silicon wafers, solar modules, solar energy systems, and solar module racking systems. Originally a silicon-wafer manufacturer established in 1959 as the Monsanto Electronic Materials Company, a former business unit of Monsanto Company, Monsanto sold the company in 1989. Prior to May 30, 2013, the company was known as MEMC Electronic Materials; the name change to SunEdison reflects the company's focus on solar energy.[2] SunEdison's corporate headquarters are in Maryland Heights, Missouri, and the company's operational and solar headquarters are in Belmont, California with offices throughout the world.
Established in the early stages of the semiconductor electronics industry in 1959, MEMC was for the next half century a major and pioneering manufacturer of silicon wafers, the most basic element of semiconductor-chip manufacturing. The company entered the solar market in a major way beginning in 2006, with longterm contracts to manufacture and sell solar wafers to several large Asian solar-energy companies. Contracts with other solar-energy companies followed, as did joint-venture projects on solar power plants. With the acquisition of the large, successful, and pioneering solar-energy systems company SunEdison LLC in late 2009 and the smaller solar-power companies Axio and Fotowatio in 2011, MEMC focused increasingly on the burgeoning solar-energy industry to offset the cyclical downturns in the semiconductor market. The company now develops, finances, and maintains solar power systems and plants for a widespread commercial, public-sector, and power-plant customer base, and its name change in 2013 to SunEdison, Inc. reflects its main focus. It is one of the leading solar-power companies worldwide, and with its acquisition of wind-energy company First Wind in 2014, SunEdison is the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3] SunEdison's subsidiaries TerraForm Power and TerraForm Global own and operate renewable-energy projects around the globe.[4] In 2015, SunEdison sold off its subsidiary SunEdison Semiconductor, which manufactures silicon wafers for the electronics industry. The divestiture marked the completion of SunEdison, Inc.'s transition from a semiconductor-wafer company to a dedicated renewable-energy corporation.
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[5][6][7]

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
The establishment of Monsanto Electronic Materials Company (MEMC), a silicon wafer–manufacturing division to serve the emerging electronics industry, was announced on August 6, 1959, as an arm of the U.S.-based multinational corporation Monsanto.[8] In February 1960 MEMC started production of 19mm silicon ingots at its location in St. Peters, Missouri, 30 miles west of Monsanto's headquarters in St. Louis.[9] As one of the first companies to produce semiconductor wafers, MEMC was a pioneer in the field, and some of its innovations became industry standards into the 21st century.[10] MEMC used the Czochralski process (CZ process) of silicon crystal production,[11] and developed the Chemical Mechanical Polishing (CMP) process of wafer finishing.[10][12][13] In 1966 MEMC installed its first reactors for the production of epitaxial wafers,[14][15] and developed zero-dislocation crystal growing, which made large-diameter silicon crystals possible.[10][16]
Expansion[edit]
In the early 1970s, MEMC opened a production plant in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and sent its St. Peters–produced 2.25-inch ingots there for slicing and polishing.[10][17] In 1979, MEMC became the first company to manufacture 125mm (5-inch) wafers; in 1981 the first to produce 150mm (6-inch) wafers; and, in partnership with IBM, in 1984 the first to produce 200mm (8-inch) wafers.[15][18][19][20] In 1986 MEMC opened its production and R&D facility in Utsunomiya, Japan, to serve the Japanese semiconductor market, becoming the first non-Japanese wafer maker with manufacturing and research facilities in Japan.[21][22]
Change of ownership[edit]
MEMC experienced heavy price-pressure from Japanese competition during the mid 1980s.[10] Despite its success and increasing revenues, MEMC had to account for losses for a few years, leading to the decision of Monsanto, which was refocusing on chemicals, agriculture, and biotechnology products, to sell the electronic materials division.[10][23][24] In 1989 the German company Hüls AG, the chemicals arm of the German conglomerate VEBA, acquired Monsanto Electronic Materials and combined it with Hüls' previous acquisition Dynamite Nobel Silicon (DNS) to form MEMC Electronic Materials.[10][25][26][27] DNS already operated silicon wafer plants in Merano and Novara, Italy and integrated them within the new MEMC Electronic Materials.[28] Hüls supported the new subsidiary with $50 million, for research and development and for manufacturing expansion.[10][29] In 1991 MEMC developed the first process using granular polysilicon, which provided cost and productivity advantages over "chunk" polysilicon.[10][30] Four years later MEMC acquired Albemarle Corporation's granular polysilicon production facility in Pasadena, Texas, which had been producing granular polysilicon since 1987.[10][31]
MEMC's stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange with an initial public offering in 1995.[10][15] The IPO raised over $400 million, which went to finance an aggressive growth plan and repay some of the debt to its parent company, and Hüls/VEBA retained a majority interest in the company.[10][27][32]
The cyclical downturn in the semiconductor business in the late 1990s hit MEMC hard.[10][27][33] In 1998 the company reported a loss of $316 million on revenues of $759 million.[10] In June 2000 VEBA AG, still holding 72% of MEMC, was merged with VIAG to form the new E.ON AG.[10][34] E.ON wanted to focus on its core business of electric utilities, and assigned Merrill Lynch to sell MEMC.[10][34][35] Merrill was unable to find a buyer until MEMC announced that it was on the verge of illiquidity in the middle of 2001.[36] Finally in October 2001 E.ON was able to agree on a deal with the private equity company Texas Pacific Group (TPG), which purchased E.ON's stake in MEMC for a symbolic dollar and offered MEMC $150 million in credit lines.[35][36][37][38] TPG restructured MEMC's debt, increased its stake in the company to 90%, and cut one third of its workforce.[10][39][40]
MEMC returned to profitability following the appointment of Nabeel Gareeb, who was CEO of MEMC from April 2002 to November 2008.[10][39][41][42] MEMC's market share rose again and by 2003 it reported positive earning figures.[39][43] MEMC's sales topped $1 billion in 2004, and it was number three in market share.[10][44] Through a secondary offering, TPG reduced its share of MEMC in 2005 to 34%, and by the end of 2007, to zero.[39][44]
Solar market entry[edit]




SunEdison Solar Testing Facility


In 2006 MEMC announced its large-scale entry into the burgeoning solar wafer market, via longterm agreements to supply China-based Suntech Power and Taiwan-based Gintech Energy with solar-grade silicon wafers.[45][46][47] Similar contracts followed with Germany-based Conergy in 2007,[39] and Taiwan-based Tainergy Tech in 2008.[48] The company cultivated short-term solar wafer customers as well.[39][49] By 2007, MEMC held approximately 14% of the solar wafer market.[19] Having returned MEMC to a foundation of profitability and having helped it enter the solar market, CEO Nabeel Gareeb resigned in November 2008.[41][50] Ahmad Chatila was appointed President and CEO in February 2009.[51]
In July 2009 MEMC and Q-Cells, which specialized in construction and operation of photovoltaic plants, formed a joint venture to build Strasskirchen Solar Park, a 50 MW photovoltaic plant in Bavaria, Germany, with MEMC supplying the solar wafers and Q-Cells converting them into solar cells.[52][53] Both partners invested $100 million each, in return for a 50%-each ownership of the project.[52] As planned, the plant was sold to an investment firm, Nordcapital, after operations started at the beginning of 2010.[54]
Acquisition of SunEdison[edit]
In November 2009 MEMC acquired the privately owned company SunEdison LLC, North America's largest solar energy services provider.[55] Founded by Jigar Shah,[56] SunEdison had been developing, financing, building, operating, and monitoring large-scale photovoltaic plants for commercial customers, including many national retail outlets, government agencies, and utilities, since 2003.[57][58][59] The company had pioneered solar-as-a-service, and the solar power purchase agreement (PPA) for no-money-down customer financing.[56][60][61] With the acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC became a developer of solar power projects and North America's largest solar energy services provider.[62] CEO Ahmad Chatila announced that "MEMC will now participate in the actual development of solar power plants and commercialization of clean energy, in addition to supplying the solar and semiconductor industries with our traditional silicon wafer products."[63] SunEdison was purchased for $200 million, 70% in cash and 30% in MEMC stock, plus retention payments, transaction expenses, and the assumption of net debt.[55][62][64]
Following its acquisition of SunEdison, MEMC also began to focus on developing and acquiring advanced technologies used in the production of low-cost, high-performance solar panels. It acquired the California-based solar tech company Solaicx in mid 2010.[65] The acquisition included Solaicx's high-volume proprietary "continuous crystal growth" manufacturing technology, which produces low-cost monocrystalline silicon ingots for high-efficiency solar cells.[66][67][68][69]
In February 2011 Samsung Fine Chemicals and MEMC announced a 50/50 joint venture to build a polysilicon production plant in Ulsan, South Korea.[70] The plant was to have an initial capacity of 10,000 metric tons per annum.[70] As of late 2014 the joint venture, called SMP, is 85% owned by SunEdison (50% by SunEdison, Inc. and 35% by SunEdison Semiconductor)[71] and 15% by Samsung, and the plant has a capacity of 13,500 metric tons per annum.[72][73][74] By October 2014, the plant began producing the world’s first high-pressure fluidized bed reactor (HP-FBR) polysilicon, enabling sizeable reductions in the cost of solar energy.[75][76][77]
In 2011 MEMC also extended its solar-energy business. In June 2011, it acquired another North American solar-power project developer, Axio Power.[78][79][80] Axio Power, founded in 2007, developed, financed, and constructed large-scale solar projects, and had more than 500 MW of utility-scale photovoltaic power projects in Canada and the western U.S.[78][79] In July 2011, MEMC established a joint venture with Korea-based Jusung Engineering, to combine its proprietary Solaicx CCZ monocrystalline wafers with Jusung's high-efficiency cell manufacturing equipment to provide low-cost, high-efficiency solar cells.[81] In September 2011, MEMC acquired Fotowatio Renewable Ventures Inc., the U.S. unit of Fotowatio Renewable Ventures, a developer, operator and owner of solar power plants.[82][83] The FRV purchase added up to 1.4 GW of solar projects in the U.S. to MEMC's portfolio.[84]
In December 2011 MEMC undertook restructuring measures in reaction to a cyclical downturn in its semiconductor business and a slump in the whole supply chain of photovoltaic modules. The company announced a headcount reduction of 1,300 employees (18% of the workforce), plus capacity reduction and productivity increase for polysilicon and wafers.[85][86]
In 2012 MEMC developed its Silvantis line of multi-crystalline 290-watt solar modules. With 1,000-volt UL certification, the modules created considerable overall energy-production and systems savings on solar projects due to the ability to be more efficiently wired.[87]
Name change[edit]
On May 30, 2013, MEMC Electronic Materials changed its name to SunEdison, Inc., and also changed its stock-market ticker from "WFR" to "SUNE", reflecting the company's focus on solar energy.[2][88] In May 2014, SunEdison formally separated its electronics-wafer business from its solar-wafer and solar-energy business. SunEdison Semiconductor, Ltd. spun off in an IPO on the NASDAQ under the ticker "SEMI", with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[89] The IPO generated $94 million, used to fund the company's growth.[90]
In July 2014, SunEdison created a yieldco subsidiary, called TerraForm Power, Inc., with SunEdison, Inc. maintaining a majority stake as the largest shareholder.[91][92] TerraForm began publicly trading in an IPO under the ticker "TERP".[93][94][95] This IPO of the power-generation subsidiary spin-off raised roughly $500 million.[90] SunEdison launched a second yieldco subsidiary, TerraForm Global, in 2015, to manage renewable-energy projects in emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India.[96][97] This second yieldco trades on the NASDAQ under the ticker "GLBL".[97]
In October 2014 SunEdison announced the development of "zero white space" solar modules, which eliminate wasted space on the solar module surface.[98] That month it also announced the implementation of "high-pressure fluidized bed reactor" (HP-FBR) technology, producing high-purity polysilicon up to 10 times more efficiently and with 90% less energy used than non-FBR technologies.[99]
In November 2014, with its subsidiary TerraForm Power, SunEdison purchased First Wind, one of the largest wind power developers in the United States, for $2.4 billion.[3][100][101] The acquisition added wind energy to SunEdison's capacity, and made it the leading renewable energy development company in the world.[3][102]
In 2015, MIT Technology Review named SunEdison #6, and the top energy company, in its annual "50 Smartest Companies" list. The review characterized SunEdison as "Aggressively expanding its renewable energy products and building a business to provide electricity to the developing world."[103]
In June 2015, SunEdison, Inc. announced its full divestiture from its semiconductor business, the publicly traded company SunEdison Semiconductor.[104] The completion of the sell-off finalized SunEdison's transition into a dedicated renewable-energy company.[105][106]
Bankruptcy[edit]
Following years of major expansion and the announcement of the intent – which eventually fell through – to acquire the residential-rooftop solar company Vivint Solar in 2015, SunEdison's stock plummeted and its more than $11 billion in debt caused it to face bankruptcy in April 2016.[107][108][109][110][111] It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 21, 2016.[112][113] To continue its operations and pay staff, the company received $300 million in bankruptcy debt financing.[114] It will continue operations during bankruptcy.[115][116] The debt financing money came from first-lien and second-lien lenders. The bankruptcy court must approve the money.[117]
When it filed for bankruptcy, the company asked the court for an independent examiner to audit the company’s recent financial transactions. SunEdison requested that the examiner’s work start immediately and finish within 60 days, and that the maximum budget be $1 million. Reuters noted that, comparatively, the 2015 independent examination in the bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment Corp. took one year and cost $40 million.[117]
During the summer of 2015, SunEdison was worth almost $10 billion,[118] and in July 2015 shares traded upward of $33.44.[117] On the day of the bankruptcy filing, the company’s trading price on the New York Stock Exchange was 34 cents per share.[117]
According to the Wall Street Journal: “SunEdison used a combination of financial engineering and cheap debt to buy up renewable-power projects around the world before the market turned sour last summer and investors soured on its business model.”[118] During the three years preceding the bankruptcy filing, SunEdison invested $18 billion in acquisitions. During that time, the company also raised $24 billion in debt and equity.[118]
As of late April 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice is conducting an investigation into the company regarding its financial practices. Internally, SunEdison’s board completed its own investigation, concluding that the company’s leaders were “overly optimistic” but did not make “material misstatements” or commit any fraud.[114]
SunEdison companies[edit]

SunEdison, Inc.




SunEdison's solar materials group produces granular polysilicon, silicon-crystal ingots, silicon wafers, and specifies the production of solar cells and solar modules. It produces granular polysilicon in purities usable in the solar and semiconductor industries. The granular polysilicon is produced in Pasadena, Texas, and, through a joint venture with Samsung and SunEdison Semiconductor, in Ulsan, Korea. The granular silicon is used for SunEdison's own silicon-crystal manufacturing, and for sales to third-party solar and semiconductor crystal-manufacturing companies. The division also has a plant in Portland, Oregon acquired from Solaicx in 2010, which produces silicon-crystal ingots using the "continuous crystal growth" technology, enabling the production of low-cost wafers for high-efficiency solar cells. The ingots are sliced into wafers in Malaysia. SunEdison and its subsidiaries and joint-venture partners also manufacture the solar cells used in its modules. Its solar modules are assembled by contract manufacturers in Malaysia, Mexico, Taiwan, Korea, and China which use SunEdison technology, meet SunEdison's strict specifications, and use SunEdison's quality control systems.
