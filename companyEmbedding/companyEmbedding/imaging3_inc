The Dominion Volumetric Imaging Scanner (DVIS) is a proprietary and patented breakthrough mobile fluoroscopy technology that produces high quality 3D images in Continuous 3D Scan mode and Single 3D SafeScan mode as well as high quality 2D images in Continuous 2D Scan mode. It is the only product in existence that can produce a combination of 2D, 3D, and CT imagery in a single device. The unique engineering design accomplishes these capabilities while dramatically reducing exposure to radiation, and providing a small, mobile footprint for easy transport, all at a cost of about one third of existing CT devices.

Announces 2015 Outlook and UpdatesAccesswireFebruary 6, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareBURBANK, CA / ACCESSWIRE / February 6, 2015 / Imaging3(TM), Inc. (IMGGQ) announces today that it has entered into an agreement with the accountants and advisors of the firm Rose, Snyder & Jacobs LLP, with the goal of bringing Imaging3's SEC financial reports current and obtaining a trading symbol through FINRA so that it can reemerge as a publicly traded company. Dane Medley, Chairman/CEO of Imaging3, commented, "While we cannot assure that Imaging3 will be successful in reemerging as a public company, the engagement of a new outside accounting firm represents an important step in our path to reemergence."Imaging3 also announces that its Board of Directors ratified the proposed acquisition and stock purchase of a California-based privately owned rental company that caters to the Medical and B2B marketplace. The transaction has been agreed to verbally by both parties and is currently expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2015. Imaging3 will announce the name of the company as soon as it is permitted to do so under the parties' nondisclosure agreement. Medley commented, "We are working to develop share value for the company with a new business model and are pursuing several strategic acquisitions and other business transactions in 2015. Our objective is to continue adding value towards our core competencies while enhancing and broadening our product and service offerings.Imaging3 has recently become the exclusive EnvisionTEC dealer for California for professional grade 3D printers and FDA approved medical bio plotters. EnvisionTEC is becoming a world leader in 3D printer manufacturing specializing in rapid prototyping and equipment, across a variety of markets. Imaging3 will be launching a new marketing campaign in the near future, with more details on this exciting new opportunity. Mr. Medley commented "EnvisionTEC has an excellent track record and is growing its dealer base across the US. We are excited to be partnered with an up and coming leader in the 3D market space."Imaging3 is also completing software upgrades on the Dominion VI scanner, with a goal of resubmitting Imaging3's 510(k) application to the Food and Drug Administration later this year. This process will be managed by an outside consulting firm to help expedite the FDA process. Medley stated, "We are excited at the developments and enhancements made to date as we progress towards reaching our goal of obtaining FDA approval."Inaging3's Board of Directors has also accepted the resignation of Raul Carrega as a director of Imaging3. Medley commented, "Raul has been an asset to Imaging3 over the years and we wish him the best in his future endeavors. The Board is considering options for appointing a replacement."Imaging3 will continue to provide ongoing updates in the form of filings and press releases, all of which can be found on our website, www.imaging3.com, under the news tab at the top of the page.About Imaging3Imaging3, Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a medical imaging device that produces 3D medical diagnostic images of virtually any part of the human body in real-time.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.

Imaging3 Engages Med-Device Consulting, Inc. to Assist on 510(k) Application with the FDA
Jun 12, 2017
OTC Disclosure & News Service

                            
                                - 
BURBANK, Calif., June  12, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Imaging3, Inc. (OTCQB:IGNG) announced today that on June 5, 2017 the Company hired Med-Device Consulting, Inc. to facilitate the 510(k) application to the FDA in order to obtain approval for its Dominion VI imaging device with patented SmartScan™ 3D technology.
Med-Device Consulting provides a wide range of personalized regulatory and medical quality-assurance consulting services. They have helped numerous medical device companies worldwide with 510(k) submissions, with quality-assurance and regulatory systems, with CE-mark preparation, and with ISO certification.  Med-Device represents client organizations throughout the nuanced process of engaging with the FDA, coordinates with the FDA on behalf of sponsors at meetings and via regular correspondence with the FDA during the entire lifecycle of a product, and provides support in all aspects of marketing applications, including review and editing, safety descriptions, and statistical analysis plans. They are replacing Biologics as the company’s primary regulatory liaison. President Dane Medley stated: “As part of our regulatory success strategy, we have been extremely discriminating in our selection of vendors. The engagement of Med-Device Consulting is one such example; and the hiring of CriTech Research to validate the massive software component of our Dominion VI imaging device was another. With professionals like that providing guidance each step of the way, we are optimistic we will have a successful interaction with the FDA.” Special consultant Scott Pancoast added, “Imaging3 continues to make progress, both financially and operationally.  The addition of Med-Device to the team positions the company well for eventual FDA approval and commercial success.” About Med-Device Consulting, Inc.The mission of Med-Device Consulting, Inc. is to assist companies in meeting their strategic objectives by providing highly specialized expertise and assistance on a project, temporary or on-going basis. Find out more by visiting: http://www.m-dci.us About Imaging3 Inc.Imaging3, Inc., founded in 1993, has developed a patented medical imaging technology, called SmartScan™, that will produce 3D x-ray images, virtually in real time. The SmartScan technology will allow healthcare professionals to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures more quickly and accurately, resulting in higher throughput for the clinicians and fewer safety risks for the patient. In addition, Imaging3’s technology exposes patients to significantly less harmful radiation than current imaging technologies such as CT scans, which the company believes will allow scans to be used in more pediatric applications than are currently prescribed. The technology also allows for greater portability, easier installation, and a significantly reduced cost burden for the healthcare system overall. Imaging3 is planning to submit a 510K application to the FDA during 2017 in order to gain approval to commercialize the SmartScan technology. Visit the company’s website at http://www.imaging3.com for detailed information about the Company’s technology.
