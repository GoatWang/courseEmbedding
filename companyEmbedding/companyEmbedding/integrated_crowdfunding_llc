In addition to certain guarantees provided by law, LegalZoom guarantees your satisfaction with our services and support. Because our company was created by experienced attorneys, we strive to be the best legal document service on the web. If you are not satisfied with our services, please contact us immediately and we will correct the situation, provide a refund or offer credit that can be used for future LegalZoom orders.
LegalZoom Satisfaction Guarantee Details:

If you're not satisfied, simply call us toll-free at (800) 773-0888 during our normal business hours. All requests made under this guarantee must be made within 60 days of purchase. We will process your request within 5 business days after we've received all of the documents and materials sent to you. Unfortunately, we can't refund or credit any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order. We also cannot refund any money paid by you directly to third parties, such as payments made by you directly to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products.
If you want to exchange the product you ordered for a different one, you must request this exchange and complete your replacement order within 60 days of purchase. The purchase price of the original item, less any money paid to government entities, such as filing fees or taxes, or to other third parties with a role in processing your order, will be credited to your LegalZoom account. Any payments made directly by you to attorneys affiliated with our legal plans or attorney-assisted products are not eligible for exchange or credit. Any price difference between the original order and the replacement order or, if a replacement order is not completed within 60 days of purchase, the full original purchase price (in each case less any money paid to government entities or other third parties) will be credited to the original form of payment. If you paid for your original order by check, LegalZoom will mail a check for the applicable amount to your billing address.
Please note that we cannot guarantee the results or outcome of your particular procedure. For instance, the government may reject a trademark application for legal reasons beyond the scope of LegalZoom's service. In some cases, a government backlog can lead to long delays before your process is complete. Similarly, LegalZoom does not guarantee the results or outcomes of the services rendered by our legal plan attorneys or attorney-assisted products. Problems like these are beyond our control and are not covered by this guarantee.
Since we're dedicating time and effort to your legal document preparation, our guarantee only covers satisfaction issues caused by LegalZoom - not changes to your situation or your state of mind.

Get Tips to Rock Your Crowdfunding Rewards Program!














































































Back To Top




 

 











Crowdfunding Rewards







	Crowdfunding campaign rewards are some of the most important aspects of your campaign, because they bring in the money! But even beyond that, they solidify the bond between the campaign and the backers, and keep them emotionally invested in your idea.

	It’s no secret that the more involved people feel in a project, the more likely they are to care about it. Create something personal that only backers will receive to make the rewards feel exclusive to the crowdfunding community.

	Give them a chance to be part of the inception of your idea. When your idea gains traction, backers will feel proud that they contributed to it, and you’ll gain both an advocate and someone who can bring more supporters, too.

	Rewards are super powerful, but you’ve got to be careful with how you handle them, too. If your rewards aren’t appealing, readers will lose attention; but if you have rewards that are too expensive (or if you overwhelm them with too many), even if they’re all interesting, you’ll likely lose your audience. So how do you come up with effective, profitable, and affordable rewards?

	The big secret: just put yourself in their shoes. Remember that they’re receiving and choosing the rewards, not you. You’ve got to consider that the crowd isn’t a group of angel investors, nor is it your family. It’s just someone with a little bit of money to burn who’s browsing through the internet looking to spend it on something cool, not break their bank. What do you think they do outside looking at your campaign? Try to use that as a guide for their interests, and for what else they might enjoy seeing. So if you can give them something compelling and interesting to spend it on, you’ve probably got yourself a backer!

	Be careful when it comes to physical rewards like t-shirts; the cost can add up pretty quickly. Rewards don’t have to be tangible! They can be as simple as a social media shoutout or thank you card

	If you do choose to use physical rewards, ensure that you’ve done all the necessary calculations to make sure you’ve put them at the right price point. Also, going back to researching your audience, make sure that whatever swag you create is something you know your backers will use, something more personal to them based on their interests. They’ll like it more, they’ll use it more, and they’ll be more proud of their contribution.

	If your idea is a tangible product, offering a prototype or a presale of your product is obviously a great idea, because you should already have all the resources necessary to produce those--no outsourcing necessary! You shouldn’t end up in the red from selling your own product, and you’ll gain some valuable publicity and feedback once people are using it.

	In terms of crowdfunding, rewards are the most important part of a crowdfunding campaign; they have the power to take your campaign from 0 to 60. Use them wisely!

Crowdfunding 101
by Bilal Kaiser, August 2012





At its core, the Internet has created centralized communities of like-minded individuals who bond over mutual interests. These interests can be general or very specific in their scope—that's all good news for a new era of risk-takers who want their pet projects to finally see the light of day. What follows is an introduction to the ins and outs of this brave new world. Crowdfunding: What it is It used to be, if you wanted to get money to make your creative, entrepreneurial or start-up idea a reality, you had to find investors, set up lots of meetings, file the proper paperwork and go through lengthy (and costly) processes before ever earning a dollar. And all of that was before you put in the countless hours of hard work to ensure your project's success. Today, through the magic of the Internet, social media has changed the way projects are funded, and in turn, successfully completed. It's called crowdfunding and it may be the ideal solution for that indie movie you always wanted to make. Similar to the concept of crowdsourcing, where organizations divvy up a project and components are completed by a group of people—some of whom may never meet—crowdfunding pulls together funds by those believing in the power of a particular project. Creative Funding: Kickstarter One very popular platform that allows creative individuals and innovative groups to tap into the Internet for funding is Kickstarter. The company's premise is simple: creative ideas get posted on the site with a set goal for funds, and anyone can contribute to the project via credit card. Once the goal is reached, the site charges a 5 percent processing fee. Kickstarter has been used to fund student art projects, indie films, music festivals and even public radio stories. In addition to giving users a way to collect funds, the site makes it easy for visitors to discover interesting projects they might want to support. These projects can range from a high-end, custom iPhone dock idea to the dramatic/musical retelling of Franz Kafka's famous short story "The Metamorphosis.” The former recently surpassed its budget goal of $75,000 on Kickstarter—and made more than a million in revenue. Projects in Kickstarter are created on an all-or-nothing basis. Meaning, if a project reaches 100 percent of its budget goal, supporters' credit cards are billed simultaneously. If a project doesn't reach its budget goal, no one's credit card is billed. Supporters aren't investing in the true sense of the word, since no one receives a return on their money. However, project creators do offer rewards to their supporters as a way of thanking them. Some examples of this includes copies of the project being made available to the supporter, limited editions of the project and a custom experience related to the project itself. Anything Funding: Indiegogo Another crowdfunding platform is Indiegogo. While Kickstarter is limited to creative projects, Indiegogo allows anyone to collect money for anything—and we mean anything. From prefunding for a photography book to medical bills for a sick relative, Indiegogo opens its site to any and all causes. Processing fees for successful projects are similar to Kickstarter—around 4 percent. There are other similar sites available to interested parties as well, but Kickstarter and Indiegogo offer not only a reputable platform and large network of visitors, they're also incredibly easy to use. Both sites offer step-by-step instructions and boast a wide array of concepts and projects available for investment. The Internet revolution continues, but unlike ever before, commerce and creativity are connecting on a whole other level. If you're ready to see what the Internet can do for you, give these sites a try and see what happens. Maybe that LLC you've always dreamed of owning and operating is now one step closer to reality. Even if that reality begins in the virtual world.

Quick Pitch

Spellbinding Home Entertainement
Grimani Systems elegant technology solutions are designed specifically for luxury home cinemas, and truly convey the artistic vision of the musicians and filmmakers of the ultra high-definition era.
Our debut product, the CinemaOne Audio Ensemble, delivers exceptional sound quality and audience coverage thanks to the groundbreaking Conic Section Array™ loudspeaker waveguide. Watch for the Grimani Systems CinemaOne 4K Ultra High-Definition Video Package for private home theaters, coming in 2016.
See grimanisystems.com 











Product/Service Details


CinemaOne
With a combined 60 years of experience building in excess of 1000 recording and playback environments, Grimani Systems has created the CinemaOne Audio Ensemble, a turnkey solution capable of delivering a flawless representation of the artist’s original intention.
Front and center of our achievement is the Conic Section Array™waveguide (CSA), the loudspeaker’s driving technology.
The Grimani Systems CinemaOne audio package has 13 speakers, more than 16,000 watts of power, 25 channels of amplification, and 10 sophisticated DSP units feeding each of those 25 amplifier channels separately. Everything is networked and programmable. 











Traction & Accomplishments

Fast Forward!
We developed the whole CinemaOne Audio Ensemble in less than a year, and launched it at the industry's largest convention, called CEDIA Expo 2014. In October of 2015 Grimani Systems demonstrated its system at the CEDIA Expo 2015 held in Dallas, Texas. We received several industry write-ups including a Top 10 news events list published by CE Pro magazine, and Best Sound from Home Theater Review. Response from industry insiders has been extremely enthusiastic, including overtures to partner with several companies to develop complete turn-key private cinemas. Furthermore, CinemaOne is up for a Best New Product award at the September 2016 CEDIA Expo.

CEPro: Audio Experts Lauch Grimani Systems
We have completed the first dealer showroom in San Rafael, CA, the heart of Marin County, a very upscale area just north of San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge. We have orders from dealers in Los Angeles, India, and Singapore, and we have several systems in the specification stages.
Response has been overhwlemingly positive!
 











How We're Different

New-School Technology Through and Through
Front and center of our achievement is the Conic Section Array™waveguide, the loudspeaker’s driving technology. Unlike conventional loudspeakers that use "cones and domes" for the middle and high frequencies, we developed a groundbreaking waveguide technology to diffuse the sound waves into the room. The result is a more lifelike sound quality with virtually unlimitted dynamics, and with more consistent performance throughout the room.
Our systems are all fully digitally interconnected, and are networked through IP technology. The systems regularly send status information to Cloud-based data center for tracking of performance. We communicate with the units through a web browser interface, and we can verify and maintain systems by remote. Our client's systems are always up and ready to deliver the ultimate home cinema experience!
