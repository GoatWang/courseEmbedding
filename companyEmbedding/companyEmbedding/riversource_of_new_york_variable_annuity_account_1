Variable Annuities with FlexChoice


.







Lifetime Income with Fewer Compromises
Market volatility and today’s long retirements make income you can’t outlive an essential part of your portfolio.
A variable annuity with the optional FlexChoice rider lets you turn a portion of your savings into guaranteed income that lasts for life. You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two
			See why FlexChoice is a lifetime income option married couples may love.

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

Prospectuses for the investment portfolios offered by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company are available from your financial professional. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract’s features, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The investment objectives, risks, and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial variable annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions, and terms for keeping them in force. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in this product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value, even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. All contract and rider guarantees, including optional benefits and annuity payout rates, are subject to the claims paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Please contact your financial professional for complete details.
Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution tax that is generally imposed on interest, dividends, and annuity income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges.
Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. Clients should confer with their qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Annuities




Building a brighter future begins with knowing what you’ll have in retirement. Annuities can help you grow and protect what you’ve saved.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

On Feb. 1, 2005, American Express Company (American Express) announced plans    
to pursue a spin off to American Express shareholders of its American Express   
Financial Advisors unit. On Aug. 1, 2005 several of the companies offering the  
products and services of the American Express Financial Advisors unit changed   
their names in anticipation of their separation from American Express.          
American Express Financial Corporation changed its name to Ameriprise           
Financial, Inc. (Ameriprise Financial). Ameriprise Financial is the parent      
company of the Ameriprise Financial family of companies, including IDS Life     
Insurance Company (IDS Life). IDS Life is the parent company of American        
Centurion Life Assurance Company, the issuer of the annuity contract described  
in the prospectus. American Express Financial Advisors Inc., the distributor    
of the annuity contract described in the prospectus, changed its name to        
Ameriprise Financial Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise    
Financial.                                                                      

As part of a corporate reorganization, Ameriprise Financial also introduced the 
RiverSource(SM) brand. The RiverSource brand represents Ameriprise Financial's  
products. Accordingly, on Oct. 1, 2005, the RiverSource brand replaced "American
Express" and "AXP" in the name of the American Express(R) Variable Portfolio    
Funds and certain funds changed their names as indicated in the following table.
In addition, the fee table has been restated to reflect current fees.           

Total annual operating expenses for the AXP(R) Variable Portfolio funds         

(Before fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, if applicable, as a

(1) The fund's expense figures are based on actual expenses for the fiscal year 
ended Aug. 31, 2004 adjusted to reflect current fees.                   

RiverSource also is used for certain subsidiaries of Ameriprise Financial that  
provide services in connection with the annuity contract. On Oct. 1, 2005,      
RiverSource Investments, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial,
replaced Ameriprise Financial as the investment adviser of the RiverSource      
Variable Portfolio Funds. The full transition to the RiverSource name will be   
substantially completed in the fourth quarter 2005, and will be subsequently    
communicated to contract owners, as appropriate.                                

The separation of the American Express Financial Advisors unit from American    
Express was completed on Sept. 30, 2005. Ameriprise Financial and its           
subsidiaries are no longer affiliated with American Express. Ameriprise         
Financial is now an independent company trading under the ticker symbol AMP with
a board of directors and management that are separate from American Express.

Item 27. Number of Contract owners                                              

    As of March 31, 2005, there were 3 certificate owners of qualified
        certificates and 116 certificate owners of non-qualified certificates.

Item 28. Indemnification                                                        

The amended and restated By-Laws of the depositor provide that the depositor    
will indemnify, to the fullest extent now or hereafter provided for or permitted
by law, each person involved in, or made or threatened to be made a party to,   
any action, suit, claim or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, including any 
investigative, administrative, legislative, or other proceeding, and including  
any action by or in the right of the depositor or any other corporation, or any 
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise   
(any such entity, other than the depositor, being hereinafter referred to as an 
"Enterprise"), and including appeals therein (any such action or process being  
hereinafter referred to as a "Proceeding"), by reason of the fact that such     
person, such person's testator or intestate (i) is or was a director or officer 
of the depositor, or (ii) is or was serving, at the request of the depositor, as
a director, officer, or in any other capacity, or any other Enterprise, against 
any and all judgments, amounts paid in settlement, and expenses, including      
attorney's fees, actually and reasonably incurred as a result of or in          
connection with any Proceeding, except as provided below.                       

No indemnification will be made to or on behalf of any such person if a judgment
or other final adjudication adverse to such person establishes that such        
person's acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and      
deliberate dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated,  
or that such person personally gained in fact a financial profit or other       
advantage to which such person was not legally entitled. In addition, no        
indemnification will be made with respect to any Proceeding initiated by any    
such person against the depositor, or a director or officer of the depositor,   
other than to enforce the terms of this indemnification provision, unless such  
Proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors of the depositor. Further,  
no indemnification will be made with respect to any settlement or compromise of 
any Proceeding unless and until the depositor has consented to such settlement  
or compromise.                                                                  

The depositor may, from time to time, with the approval of the Board of         
Directors, and to the extent authorized, grant rights to indemnification, and to
the advancement of expenses, to any employee or agent of the depositor or to any
person serving at the request of the depositor as a director or officer, or in  
any other capacity, of any other Enterprise, to the fullest extent of the       
provisions with respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of   
directors and officers of the depositor.                                        

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 (the "Act") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons
of the depositor or the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or     
otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as        
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the     
registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling   
person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or       
proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in      
connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in 
the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such         
indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will 
be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Variable annuities are insurance products that are complex, long-term investment vehicles that are subject to market risk, including the potential loss of principal invested.
A fund underlying your contract in which a subaccount invests may have a name, portfolio manager, objectives, strategies and characteristics that are the same or substantially similar to those of a publicly-traded retail mutual fund. Despite these similarities, an underlying fund is not the same as any publicly traded retail mutual fund. Each underlying fund will have its own unique portfolio holdings, fees, operating expenses and operating results. The results of each underlying fund may differ significantly from any publicly-traded retail mutual fund.

Variable Annuities with FlexChoice


.







Lifetime Income with Fewer Compromises
Market volatility and today’s long retirements make income you can’t outlive an essential part of your portfolio.
A variable annuity with the optional FlexChoice rider lets you turn a portion of your savings into guaranteed income that lasts for life. You’ll also benefit from market gains while being protected if the market drops. All that plus real-life flexibility to adapt however life unfolds — especially if you’re married. 






At-A-Glance:
 Variable Annuities 



One of the only investments that offer income for life — no matter how long you live.
Have the potential to grow tax-deferred with the market.
Optional living and death benefits offer added protection.


















Income Built for Two
			See why FlexChoice is a lifetime income option married couples may love.

Benefits
           Make your portfolio more balanced and durable with guaranteed lifetime income that can grow.
        



Income


Flexibility


On Your Terms













Income You Can Count On








Earn 5% Growth Per Year
During the first decade, your future income goes up by compounding 5% each year, even if the market goes down or stays flat (as long as you don’t withdraw anything).
Lock in Market Gains
Each year until age 91, if your account value is higher than your Benefit Base due to market performance, you get an Automatic Step-Up that increases future payments.
5% or 6% Withdrawals at Age 65
You can start taking 5% or 6% withdrawals at age 65 depending on your choice of two options.






 

















 

















Unique Flexibility for Married Couples








For However Life Unfolds
Many guaranteed income products make married couples lock in big decisions up front. But with FlexChoice, you don’t have to decide if you want income for one or two lives unless your account value runs out.
More Income Sooner
Unlike many retirement income products, with FlexChoice the amount of income you can withdraw is based on the age of the older owner. That can mean getting a higher withdrawal rate years sooner than if you had to wait for a younger spouse to “catch up.”
Income Built for Two
If a spouse passes away, the surviving spouse continues to receive the same income payments they’ve come to rely on with no interruption.






More about 
 Spousal Flexibility 


Wondering about the cost to cover two people? There’s no extra charge to cover a spouse, and married couples even enjoy the same initial withdrawal rate as single account holders.

Make Decisions When It is Right for You








Turn Withdrawals On and Off
You can start and stop withdrawals at any time after 59½. Waiting to take withdrawals can increase the amount you’re able to withdraw later.
Choose How Much You Get
The income you receive is based on factors you control. They include the age at which you start taking withdrawals, whether you want a steady amount of income or more early on, and if you decide to cover one or two people (only after your account value runs out).
Cancel if You Change Your Mind
In some cases, you may no longer need lifetime income. That’s ok — you have alternatives if your needs change.

1 Guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
2 Shield Level Selector annuities do not invest directly in any index.
3 Product guarantees are subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are solely the responsibility of the issuing insurance company. Annuities and life insurance are issued by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company, Charlotte, NC 28277 and in New York, only by Brighthouse Life Insurance Company of NY, New York, NY 10017 and not by MetLife.
If you're buying an annuity to fund a qualified retirement plan or IRA, you should do so for the annuity's features and benefits other than tax deferral. That's because tax deferral is not an additional benefit of the annuity. References throughout this material to tax advantage, such as tax deferral and tax-free transfers, are subject to this consideration. In addition, non-qualified annuity contracts owned by corporations do not receive tax deferral on earnings. 

Prospectuses for variable annuities issued by a Brighthouse Financial insurance company, and for the investment portfolios offered thereunder, are available from Brighthouse Financial. The contract prospectus contains information about the contract's features, risks, charges and expenses. The investment objectives, risks and policies of the investment options, as well as other information about the investment options, are described in their respective prospectuses. Please read the prospectuses and consider this information carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any of the variable investment options in a variable annuity product will meet their stated goals or objectives. The account value is subject to market fluctuations and investment risk so that, when withdrawn, it may be worth more or less than its original value even when an optional protection benefit rider is elected. Product availability and features may vary by state. Please refer to the contract prospectus for more complete details regarding the living and death benefits.

Annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Brighthouse Financial annuities have limitations, exclusions, charges, termination provisions and terms for keeping them in force. All contract guarantees, including optional living and death benefit riders and annuity payout rates, are backed by the claims-paying ability and financial strength of issuing insurance company. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which an annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency where an annuity is purchased, or any affiliates to those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability and financial strength of the issuing insurance company. Similarity, the issuing insurance company and the underwriter do not back the financial strength of the broker/dealer or its affiliates. Please contact your financial professional for complete details. 

Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and if made before age 59½, may be subject to a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some broker/dealers and financial professionals may refer to the 10% federal income tax penalty as an "additional tax" or "additional income tax" or use the terms interchangeably when discussing withdrawals taken prior to age 59½. Distributions of taxable amounts from a non-qualified annuity may also be subject to the 3.8% Unearned Income Medicare Contribution Tax on Net Investment Income if your modified adjusted gross income exceeds the applicable threshold amount. Withdrawals will reduce the living and death benefits and account value. Withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. 

Any discussion of taxes is for general informational purposes only, does not purport to be complete or cover every situation, and should not be construed as legal, tax, or accounting advice. You should confer with your qualified legal, tax, and accounting advisors as appropriate.

Life Insurance




There’s more to life insurance than taking care of loved ones if you pass away. 

Life insurance can also be an essential part of a financial plan. In addition to helping to protect loved ones financially with a death benefit, some products can grow money on a tax-advantaged basis that can be used during one’s lifetime. The ability to meet more than one need makes life insurance a product that adds valuable flexibility to any portfolio.

Talk to your financial professional if you think life insurance might be right for you.















                                Our easy-to-use tool can help guide you to start the conversation around life insurance with your financial professional. 
 

















Types of Life Insurance





Permanent Life Insurance
Provides coverage that lasts a lifetime and can build cash value that can be used while living. 



Term Life Insurance
Provides coverage for a specific length of time and provides the most payout for the money, but does not build cash value.

















Permanent Life Insurance
Permanent life insurance is designed to provide coverage for life. Many permanent life insurance products also have a feature called cash value. This cash value can grow over time through interest credits, market returns, or dividends, providing money that can be used for a variety of needs.  

Permanent life insurance products include: Universal Life, Indexed Universal Life, Whole Life, and Variable Universal Life.







Premier Accumulator Universal Life
Can grow cash value quickly and allows faster access to your money when you need it.
Learn More 
.


















Term Life Insurance
Term life insurance covers you for a fixed number of years, such as 1, 5, 10, 20, or 30 and pays a death benefit if you pass away during the covered time period. Most term insurance policies offer a level premium, death benefit, and the ability to convert to a permanent policy if your needs change. You can also choose coverage for current needs and add optional riders for future needs.







Guaranteed Level Term
Available in coverage amounts of $1 million or more, with premiums guaranteed to stay the same throughout the level premium period.

History[edit]

More Information about Annuities





What exactly is an Annuity?

                        An annuity is an investment product that provides safe, tax-deferred growth of your
                        retirement nest egg. Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly
                        income when
                        you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include:
                        fixed,
                        variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial
                        professional to
                        help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.
                    








Is an Annuity Right for You?

                        Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for
                        guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment.
                        They are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225
                        billion in annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!
                    








What are your Next Steps?

                        The first thing to do is to see if an annuity fits your specific profile and financial
                        situation. This "fit" is based on the amount of retirement savings you currently have, how old
                        you are, and the State you live in. Simply fill in the information above and our system will
                        generate a free, tailor-made Annuity Report that will include annuity rate quotes from A+ rated
                        companies in your area.

11 Annuity Tips You Should Know









































11 Tips You Absolutely Must Know About Annuities  




Tip #11: There are different types of annuities.  Some are designed for accumulation and growth; while others are designed to maximize retirement income. Fixed annuities provide a safe alternative to bank CD’s. It’s very important to select the right type of annuity for your situation.

Tip #10: If you purchase a traditional fixed annuity, find a company that has a history of providing competitive renewal rates. This is important because the interest rate you earn is only guaranteed for a portion of the term. Some companies have a history of paying better renewal rates than others. The rates for CD-type annuities remain the same for the term. 







Tip #8: If you purchase an immediate annuity with a “life with cash refund or life with installment refund”, the listed beneficiaries will receive 100% of the remaining dollars.  Annuities avoid probate, so select the right beneficiary!




Tip #9:
  Rates that look too good to be true, usually are. Make sure to check the companies rating before purchasing and look for stable, highly rated companies. You also want to diversify. Don't invest all of your savings with 1 company. 







Tip #5: Income annuities (SPIA’s) usually provide the highest contractually guaranteed payout of any type of annuity if you need “income now”. SPIA's also have no fees.

Tip #7: Insurance agents usually get paid more the longer the money is locked up.  Many states have banned annuities with terms over 10 years.  You should do the same. 




Tip #6: You might have seen annuity ads where an annuity earned 12-15% with no risk. These come from "uncapped" index annuities. These returns are possible when market indexes go up considerably. Keep in mind these returns are not normal. 




Bonus Tip :  Let us help you. Request our free annuity report and we will send you what we feel are the best annuities available on the market today. Our free report compares 1,420 annuities from America's two largest annuity databases to find the highest guaranteed returns.

Tip #4:  Be careful of the fees on variable annuities.  Variable annuities have many different layers of fees. Get an itemized breakdown of all of the fees.  If your variable annuity earns 7-9% gross and you pay 3-4% in fees, you may be better off in fixed products.




Tip #3: Shop around. Don't buy any annuity until you compare the rates, benefits and fees of all of the products available.   Rates vary considerably! The top 5 year fixed annuity is now paying 220% more interest than the bottom in our database. 




Tip #2:  Index annuities - 1. Does it have a cap?  2. In plain english, how is the gain calculated?  If you are looking at index annuities with an income rider, we can compare 150+ products and show you which products guarantee the most income in our free report. 











Tip #1:
 Longevity annuities (DIA's) allow you to take a lump sum and turn it into "income later". The US treasury department and IRS have endorsed this type of annuity in recent years and made them more accessible in 401(k) plans.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
