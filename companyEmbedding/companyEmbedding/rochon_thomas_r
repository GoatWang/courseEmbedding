How and why do cultural transformations, such as those affecting race and gender relations, take place? How does one value win acceptance in society when there are conflicting values competing for attention? InCulture Moves, Thomas Rochon addresses this complex process and develops a theory to explain both how values originate and how they spread. In particular, he analyzes the crucial role that small communities of critical thinkers play in developing new ideas and inspiring their dissemination through larger social movements. Rochon develops this theory by drawing from such sources as survey research, content analysis of the mass media, and historical accounts. He focuses mainly on contemporary issues in the United States--such as feminism, civil rights, and environmentalism--but also discusses cases ranging from the French Revolution to the abolition of slavery. He explores the cultural niches--typically universities and research institutes--where new ideas and values evolve and then traces how these ideas play out in society through movements that may have little formal structure. Attention in the media, he argues, is often a deciding move in the contest over public opinion. This book will fundamentally revise how we understand the process of social change and what the prospects are for particular culture moves in the future.Product IdentifiersISBN-100691070334ISBN-139780691070339Key DetailsAuthorThomas R.

Thomas R. Rochon

Thomas
R. Rochon has served as a
Director of the Company since 2009 and as a Director of Tompkins Trust Company
since January 2009. In July, 2008, Dr. Rochon was appointed President of Ithaca
College. Prior to his appointment, he served from 2003 to July, 2008 as the
Executive Vice President and Chief Academic Officer for the University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota, following a career as professor of political science on
the faculties of Princeton University and Claremont Graduate University.  From 2000 to 2003, he was the Executive
Director of the Graduate Record Examinations program at the Educational Testing
Service (ETS). He is on the board of directors of New York Campus Compact, an
association of colleges and universities committed to community service, and
also serves on the Executive Committee of the Council of Independent Colleges
and Universities, the association of private institutions of higher education
in New York State.  He is also actively
involved with several local charitable organizations.  We believe Dr. Rochon’s qualifications to sit
on our Board of Directors include his many years of management experience,
including as the President of Ithaca College, as well as an understanding of
the challenges faced by an organization which operates in a heavily regulated
sector.

A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

 Some periods in history are marked by stability in cultural values; at other times, values undergo rapid change. How and why do cultural transformations, such as those affecting race and gender relations, take place? How does one value win acceptance in society when there are conflicting values competing for attention? In Culture Moves, Thomas Rochon addresses this complex process and develops a theory to explain both how values originate and how they spread. In particular, he analyzes the crucial role that small communities of critical thinkers play in developing new ideas and inspiring their dissemination through larger social movements. Rochon develops this theory by drawing from such sources as survey research, content analysis of the mass media, and historical accounts. He focuses mainly on contemporary issues in the United States--such as feminism, civil rights, and environmentalism--but also discusses cases ranging from the French Revolution to the abolition of slavery. He explores the cultural niches--typically universities and research institutes--where new ideas and values evolve and then traces how these ideas play out in society through movements that may have little formal structure. Attention in the media, he argues, is often a deciding move in the contest over public opinion. This book will fundamentally revise how we understand the process of social change and what the prospects are for particular culture moves in the future.

Review


One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 1998"Rochon has written an important book that is a very welcome contribution to the scholarly discourse on movements and culture, particularly because it focuses on the cultural effects of movement activities. . . . This book is a 'must' for scholars in the field of cultural studies."--American Journal of Sociology"This well-documented and well-illustrated book presents a new theoretical framework that increases understanding of the processes of cultural change and makes a significant contribution to the literature. Highly recommended."--E-Streams

It evaluates large cultural changes such as our change in perception of smoking, women's roles and rights, and civil rights. It also looks at prohibition and views on alcohol as an attempted culture move that did not succeed.  The book lays out a well thought out and persuasive model for what is required to accomplish changes in culture.  I am interested in environmental issues, especially climate change and the methods used to deny the well established science by people who do not want to change.  I found that the book was very useful in organizing my own thoughts on climate change from the vantage point of a cultural change to accept the impact that mankind's activities are having on the earth we live on (or the current widespread denial that human activity can have a global impact that we should be concerned with). I think the book will help anyone looking at other shifts in culture.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseSee all verified purchase reviews (newest first)Write a customer reviewSearch customer reviewsSearch

 The crusade against nuclear weapons in Great Britain, West Germany, France, and the Netherlands in the early 1980s dwarfed all previous protest movements in Western Europe in the postwar period. What produced the demonstrations against NATO's decision in December 1979 to base 572 cruise and Pershing II missiles in five West European countries? What generated the widespread support that the demonstrators enjoyed? Contrary to the frequent claim that such political movements are a symptom of governmental crisis in the advanced industrial democracies, Thomas Rochon develops the idea that they arise from a creative impulse and perform crucial functions of innovative criticism. He concludes that the West European peace movement has ignited a public debate in which reduction or elimination of certain categories of nuclear weapons is taken seriously for the first time.Among the topics examined are the sources of support for the peace movement in public opinion, the types of people who joined or supported the movement, and proposals they offered for a nonnuclear defense policy. The author discusses the organization of the movement and its choice of tactics, its impact on politics, and the links between it and other institutions such as churches, trade unions, and political parties.Originally published in 1988.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.

Thomas R. Rochon

Thomas
R. Rochon has served as a
Director of the Company since 2009 and as a Director of Tompkins Trust Company
since January 2009. In July, 2008, Dr. Rochon was appointed President of Ithaca
College. Prior to his appointment, he served from 2003 to July, 2008 as the
Executive Vice President and Chief Academic Officer for the University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota, following a career as professor of political science on
the faculties of Princeton University and Claremont Graduate University.  From 2000 to 2003, he was the Executive
Director of the Graduate Record Examinations program at the Educational Testing
Service (ETS). He is on the board of directors of New York Campus Compact, an
association of colleges and universities committed to community service, and
also serves on the Executive Committee of the Council of Independent Colleges
and Universities, the association of private institutions of higher education
in New York State.  He is also actively
involved with several local charitable organizations.  We believe Dr. Rochon’s qualifications to sit
on our Board of Directors include his many years of management experience,
including as the President of Ithaca College, as well as an understanding of
the challenges faced by an organization which operates in a heavily regulated
sector.

Former Presidents
 










President Shirley M. Collado's career has been shaped by a commitment to collaboration, innovation, and the value of full participation. These commitments have emerged as common threads throughout her career as a clinical psychologist, faculty member, not-for-profit manager, and higher education administrator. She joins the Ithaca College community at an exciting time in the institution’s history: 2017 marks the college’s 125th anniversary, and a yearlong celebration will honor its roots, distinctiveness in U.S. higher education, and special relationships that have connected students, alumni, faculty, staff, and families through the years. 
Collado began her tenure as Ithaca College's ninth president on July 1, 2017. She will be inaugurated on November 4, 2017, as part of the Weekend on South Hill, a three-day celebration of the college’s 125th anniversary.  
“I am proud to welcome Shirley Collado to Ithaca College as our next president,” says Thomas Grape ’80, chairman of the board of trustees. “The breadth and caliber of her experience in student and faculty development, her strength in large-scale strategic planning, her commitment to shared governance, and her track record of bringing people together to solve problems and get results make her the perfect leader to shape the next chapter of this college’s history.”

Description

                    Some periods in history are marked by stability in cultural values; at other times, values undergo rapid change. How and why do cultural transformations, such as those affecting race and gender relations, take place? How does one value win acceptance in society when there are conflicting values competing for attention? In Culture Moves, Thomas Rochon addresses this complex process and develops a theory to explain both how values originate and how they spread. In particular, he analyzes the crucial role that small communities of critical thinkers play in developing new ideas and inspiring their dissemination through larger social movements. Rochon develops this theory by drawing from such sources as survey research, content analysis of the mass media, and historical accounts. He focuses mainly on contemporary issues in the United States--such as feminism, civil rights, and environmentalism--but also discusses cases ranging from the French Revolution to the abolition of slavery.
He explores the cultural niches--typically universities and research institutes--where new ideas and values evolve and then traces how these ideas play out in society through movements that may have little formal structure. Attention in the media, he argues, is often a deciding move in the contest over public opinion. This book will fundamentally revise how we understand the process of social change and what the prospects are for particular culture moves in the future.show more

This book is a 'must' for scholars in the field of cultural studies."--American Journal of Sociology "This well-documented and well-illustrated book presents a new theoretical framework that increases understanding of the processes of cultural change and makes a significant contribution to the literature.

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
