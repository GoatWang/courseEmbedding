How It Works for Buyers


How it Works Video | How it Works for Sellers | Lease Glossary

STEP 1.

									The first step is to search through the vehicles available on Swapalease.com via the Vehicle Search.  You can search by Year, Make, Model, 
									Payment, Location, and/or Months Remaining.  
									Click here to use the Vehicle Search 


									The search process highlights the
									important terms of each lease, such as monthly payment, miles allowed, and months
									remaining.  You can click on each vehicle listing for more detailed information.
									

									You can ask questions about the vehicle
									by anonymously emailing the seller via the "More Info" option.  More specific
									questions can be asked upon registering as a buyer (see below).
									

									If you do not find a vehicle that meets
									your needs, use the "Notify Me" feature and we will notify you by email when a vehicle
									matching your preferences becomes available.
								

STEP 2.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest, the next step is to register as a Buyer with Swapalease. You can register directly from the 
									vehicle listing page, or from the homepage.  You will be asked to provide some basic information that will later be used for 
									credit approval and lease transfer.
									

Click here to Register as a Buyer with Swapalease


									After registering, you will gain access to the contact information for sellers on the site.
									

									The cost for Buyer Registration are minimal, and includes access to seller contact information, 
									unlimited customer support from Swapalease.com, a buyer "mailbox," and all internal processing through the transfer process. Your 
									registration can be used for an unlimited number of vehicles. 
								

STEP 3.

									Once you find a vehicle of interest and you have contacted the Seller, the next step is to initiate the transfer. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check, which will determine whether you are eligible to assume the lease. 
									


									If you want to learn more about your credit history, click here
									
									

									During this time, you and the Seller should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as 
									whether shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary. 
									

To find out more about Shipping, Inspections and other Services, click here


									Seller contact information is stored in your Buyer "mailbox". 
								

STEP 4.

									Once your credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									the Seller and the leasing company. 
									Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the necessary information, sign the 
									documents, and take possession of the vehicle. 
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and taking possession of the keys to your new vehicle, the process is complete! 
									

									Any Questions?
									

									Feel free to call us now at (866) 792 7669 or e-mail us at support@Swapalease.com

									Thereafter, your vehicle listing is "active" and available to millions of Buyers who visit Swapalease every year.
								

STEP 2.

									You can monitor the activity on your Swapalease ad at any time in the Account Management area by logging in as a Registered User from the 
									homepage.
									

									The Account Management section allows you to monitor the number of "hits" on your ad, extend or edit the vehicle listing, and contact 
									serious buyers.
									
									You will also have access to both SwapGarage, which will assist in enhancing your vehicle listing and optimizing your vehicle's exposure 
									to Buyers, and SwapAdvisor, which will answer any specific questions that you have about selling your vehicle.
									
									In addition, you will be provided with a "mailbox" to which buyer inquiries about your vehicle will be forwarded.
								

STEP 3.

									When a serious buyer registers with Swapalease, you will be notified by email. Included in the email is the buyer's name, phone and 
									email address. It is important to check your Swapalease mailbox on a regular basis. You may also hear from interested buyers via 
									telephone. Once you find an interested Buyer, the next step is to initiate the transfer using your Account Management area. The transfer 
									initiation process includes a credit check for the potential Buyer, which will determine whether the Buyer is eligible to assume your lease.
									

									During this time, you and the Buyer should also discuss the transfer details. It is important to consider the details, such as whether 
									shipping and/or vehicle inspections will be required and if any buyer incentives will be necessary.
								

STEP 4.

									Once the Buyer's credit has been approved and you have agreed to make a transfer, Swapalease will guide you through the process with 
									your leasing company. Swapalease guides you through the entire lease transfer process. You simply provide the information, sign the 
									documents and pay applicable leasing company fees**, and turn over the vehicle.
									

									Upon signing off on the paperwork and handing over the keys to your vehicle, the process is complete!

Collection Account be registered in the name of the Initial Secured
Party, payable to the order of the Initial Secured Party or
specially endorsed to the Initial Secured Party except to the
extent the foregoing have been specially endorsed to the Securities
Intermediary or in blank.


 


Section 2.02. Grant of Security
Interest . The Initial Secured Party Grants to the Indenture
Trustee on the 2015-B Closing Date, as Indenture Trustee for the
benefit of the 2015-B Secured Parties, all of the Initial Secured
Party’s right, title and interest in, to and under, whether
now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising in, the
2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account. The Grant of the 2015-B
Exchange Note Collection Account includes all rights, powers and
options (but none of the obligations) of the Initial Secured Party
as holder of the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account, including
the immediate and continuing right to claim for, collect, receive
and give receipt for all monies included in the 2015-B Exchange
Note Collection Account, to give and receive notices and other
communications, to make waivers or other agreements, to exercise
all rights and options, to bring Proceedings in the name of the
Initial Secured Party or otherwise, and generally to do and receive
anything that any Initial Secured Party is or may be entitled to do
or receive under the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account or
with respect to the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection
Account.


 


The foregoing Grant is made in trust
to secure (i) the payment of principal of and interest on, and any
other amounts owing in respect of, the 2015-B Exchange Note as
provided in the 2015-B Exchange Note Supplement and (ii) compliance
by the Initial Secured Party with the provisions of the 2015-B
Exchange Note Supplement for the benefit of the 2015-B Secured
Parties.


 


The Indenture Trustee acknowledges
such Grant, accepts the trusts under this Agreement and agrees to
perform the duties required in this Agreement and the 2015-B
Exchange Note Supplement.

 


3






The Initial Secured Party hereby
authorizes the Indenture Trustee to file a Record or Records (as
such term is defined in the applicable UCC), including financing
statements or continuation statements, and amendments thereto, in
all jurisdictions and with all filing offices as are necessary or
advisable to perfect, and continue the perfection of, the security
interest Granted to the Indenture Trustee; provided, that the
Indenture Trustee will have no obligation to make any such filings.
Such financing statements may describe the 2015-B Exchange Note
Collection Account in any manner as the Indenture Trustee may
determine is necessary, advisable or prudent to ensure the
perfection of the security interest Granted to the Indenture
Trustee under this Agreement; provided, that the Indenture Trustee
will have no obligation to make any such determination.


 


Section 2.03. “Financial
Assets” Election . The Securities Intermediary hereby
agrees that each item of property (whether investment property,
financial asset, security, instrument or cash) credited to the
2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account shall be treated as a
“Financial Asset” set forth in Section 8-102(a)(9) of
the UCC.


 


Section 2.04. Entitlement
Orders . If at any time the Securities Intermediary shall
receive any Entitlement Order from the Assignee-Secured Party with
respect to the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account, the
Securities Intermediary shall comply with such Entitlement Order
without further consent by the Initial Secured Party or any other
Person. If at any time the Assignee-Secured Party notifies the
Securities Intermediary in writing that the Lien of the Indenture
has been released and the 2015-B Exchange Note has been paid in
full, the Securities Intermediary shall thereafter comply with
Entitlement Orders with respect to the 2015-B Exchange Note
Collection Account from the Initial Secured Party without further
consent by any other Person. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, if at any time the Securities
Intermediary receives conflicting orders or instructions from the
Assignee-Secured Party and the Initial Secured Party, the
Securities Intermediary will follow the orders or instructions of
the Assignee-Secured Party and not the Initial Secured
Party.


 


Section 2.05. Subordination of
Lien; Waiver of Set-Off . In the event that the Securities
Intermediary has or subsequently obtains by agreement, operation of
law or otherwise a security interest in the 2015-B Exchange Note
Collection Account or any Security Entitlement credited thereto,
the Securities Intermediary hereby agrees that such security
interest shall be subordinate to the security interests of the
Assignee-Secured Party and the Initial Secured Party. The Financial
Assets and other items deposited to the 2015-B Exchange Note
Collection Account will not be subject to deduction, set-off,
banker’s lien or any other right in favor of any Person or
entity other than the Assignee-Secured Party and, subject to the
provisions hereof, the Initial Secured Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Securities Intermediary may set off against amounts
on deposit in the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account (i) all
amounts due to it in respect of its customary fees and expenses for
the routine maintenance and operation of the 2015-B Exchange Note
Collection Account, and (ii) the face amount of any checks which
have been credited to the 2015-B Exchange Note Collection Account
but are subsequently returned unpaid because of uncollected or
insufficient funds.

 

Section 2.06. Notice of Adverse
Claims . Except for the claims and interests of the Initial
Secured Party and the Assignee-Secured Party in the 2015-B Exchange
Note Collection Account, the

Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms 4 Classes of Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B
    





October 03, 2016 04:14 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As part of its ongoing surveillance, Fitch Ratings has affirmed four 
      classes of outstanding notes issued by Mercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 
      (MBALT) 2015-B (2015-B).
    

      A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations of the notes reflect the increase in credit enhancement 
      and collateral performance since closing. 2015-B has exhibited low 
      credit and residual losses to date, and performance has been within 
      Fitch's expectations to date. The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's 
      expectation that the notes will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover 
      stressed loss levels consistent with the current ratings.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in 
      vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current 
      expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage 
      could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the 
      decline in coverage.
    

      Despite the transaction's growth in credit enhancement to date, the 
      residual portion of the transaction continues to become a larger 
      percentage of the securitization value. As a result, the transaction 
      continues to be sensitive to fluctuations in residual values. A material 
      deterioration in vehicle values could potentially have a negative impact 
      on the outstanding ratings.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in 
      relation to this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      MBALT 2015-B:
    

      --Class A-2A notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable
    

      --Class A-2B notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable
    

      --Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable
    

      --Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the notes will remain sufficiently enhanced to cover stressed loss levels consistent with the current ratings.RATING SENSITIVITIESUnanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults or deterioration in vehicle values could produce loss levels higher than the current expectations and impact available loss coverage. Lower loss coverage could impact ratings and Rating Outlooks, depending on the extent of the decline in coverage.Despite the transaction's growth in credit enhancement to date, the residual portion of the transaction continues to become a larger percentage of the securitization value. As a result, the transaction continues to be sensitive to fluctuations in residual values. A material deterioration in vehicle values could potentially have a negative impact on the outstanding ratings.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Form ABS Due Diligence-15E was not provided to, or reviewed by, Fitch in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:MBALT 2015-B:--Class A-2A notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-2B notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-3 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable--Class A-4 notes at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Interest Rate Stresses in Structured Finance Transactions and Covered Bonds (pub. 17 May 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879815Criteria for Rating U.S. Auto Lease ABS (pub. 24 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/879019Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for U.S. Auto Loan ABS (pub. 21 Mar 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/878723Related ResearchMercedes-Benz Auto Lease Trust 2015-B - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/872665Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1012586Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1012586Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/jsp/creditdesk/PolicyRegulation.faces?context=2&detail=31ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?" That's the opening line of "Mercedes-Benz," a song most famously recorded by singer Janis Joplin in the early 1970s. The tune gently poked fun at materialism and our desire for the finer things in life. It's fitting that the renowned German marque figures prominently in the lyric. Mercedes-Benz has long been known for crafting vehicles that emphasize luxury and refinement. For many, its vehicles are sleek symbols of status, success and good taste.
In January of 1886, Karl Benz unveiled the world's first automobile, a three-wheeled vehicle dubbed the Benz Patent Motor Car. A few months later, Gottlieb Daimler and his chief engineer Wilhelm Maybach rolled out a four-wheeled vehicle powered by his Daimler engine. The first Mercedes was crafted in 1901, shortly after Daimler's death. Built by Maybach, the car was commissioned by Emil Jellinek, one of Daimler's primary distributors, and was ultimately named after Jellinek's daughter, Mercedes.
In 1926, the companies founded by Daimler and Benz merged to form Daimler-Benz AG, and the Mercedes-Benz brand was born. The company's insignia was a three-pointed star wreathed in a laurel; the star was dreamed up by Daimler years earlier, and its three points signified the fact that his engines were used in vehicles that traveled land, air and sea.
Right from the start, the Mercedes-Benz name was synonymous with automotive excellence. One of the automaker's earliest vehicles, the 1931 Mercedes-Benz 170, distinguished itself as the world's first production car to offer a technology that was nothing short of extraordinary for the day: four-wheel independent suspension. The '30s and '40s saw Mercedes establishing itself as the brand of choice for car buyers seeking the ultimate in luxury, thanks to coveted cruisers like the 380 and 540K.
The 1950s witnessed the introduction of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL "Gullwing," a sports car that has been described as being the world's first supercar. With its dramatic styling and race-bred technology, the 300 SL reigns today as a classic coveted by collectors worldwide. The decade also saw Daimler-Benz making strides in the area of safety technology. The company's Mercedes-Benz 220 sedans were the first vehicles to incorporate its patented "crumple zone" body design, created to absorb impact in the event of a crash.
In 1963, the company cemented its reputation as the home of automotive luxury with the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 600. The elegant, luxurious sedan was also available as a limousine and featured an ahead-of-its-time air suspension system and a V8 engine that boasted 300 horsepower. The decade also saw the launch of the Mercedes-Benz 300 SEL 6.3. This full-size sedan went from zero to 60 in under seven seconds, distinguishing itself as the quickest luxury car is its day.
The 1970s saw the birth of the brand's storied S-Class line of vehicles, opulent sedans and coupes that coddled passengers with powerful engines and a long list of luxury features. The decade also saw Mercedes continuing on the cutting edge of safety technology, by being the first to offer antilock brakes in its vehicles.
Daimler-Benz's safety advancements continued in the 1980s. Its cars were the first to offer airbags and traction control. The manufacturer also raised the bar in terms of ride comfort and handling when it introduced multilink rear suspension. The technology debuted on the compact Mercedes-Benz 190 E, and it remains a vital component of the company's chassis engineering to this day.
Mercedes-Benz vehicles got an extra dose of power and performance in the 1990s, thanks to the manufacturer's partnership with AMG, a performance and tuning shop that was eventually purchased by the company to help produce ultra-high-performance versions of some of its vehicles. The first AMG model offered in the U.S. was the sporty C36 AMG in 1995; since then, Mercedes has gone on to offer an AMG-tuned version of almost all of its vehicles.
The company's current lineup is the most comprehensive in its history. With a variety of sedans, coupes, SUVs and roadsters filling Mercedes showrooms, it seems like the only thing missing is a pickup truck. Surely, the fact that Janis Joplin's song holds as much relevance today as it did four decades ago is a strong indicator that the brand's premier status is still very much intact.

Car Rental Deals


Renting a car offers several unique advantages when compared to taking your own vehicle on a potentially distant journey. First, you will not place additional miles on your car; a concern if it is still under warranty or if you are hoping to avoid additional wear and tear.  Most rental services provide truly state-of-the-art choices. From heated leather seats of GPS technology and everything in between, you will be truly enjoying the lap of luxury during your journey. There is also a wide spectrum of vehicles to rent on a daily basis.  Whether you are travelling solo or you have to accommodate the needs of up to seven companions, the chances are high that there is a vehicle suited for your discrete requirements. Let's look at some top tips and tricks to keep in mind during the rental process.
How to Find the Best Deal
You might already be aware that there are literally hundreds of different car rental firms throughout the United States. Much like any other business, not all are created equally. There are even some which you should avoid entirely. To keep things simple, we will now list a handful of questions that should be asked before committing to any type of contract. These are:

What is the price of the rental car per day?
Is any type of insurance covered within this price and if not, can it be purchased separately?
What types of vehicles are offered?
Is there a mileage limit during your rental agreement?
How can you contact customer service in the event of an emergency?
Will you be required to fill up the tank with petrol before the vehicle is returned to the lot?

It is also wise to point out that the largest firms tend to provide the best service options. Some brand names to consider are Hertz, Enterprise, Budget, Sixt and Avis. Be sure to speak with a representative to make sure that any questions are thoroughly answered beforehand. 
View deals on Car Rental now!
Choosing a Vehicle
The type of vehicle will depend upon several factors. These include:

How many passengers will be travelling with you.
The expected weather conditions.
The distance needed to be travelled.
City driving versus cross-country treks.

The range of cars can vary between miniature and compact cars to full-sized vans and sport utility vehicles. For example, a luxury sedan may be the best option if a small family is going on a trip over the weekend. Compact cars are better when navigating city traffic. An SUV or a van is ideal for those who may be attending a business seminar with a group of colleagues.
Another obvious concern is the price. Luxury vehicles such as a Cadillac will naturally cost more. This should then be combined with the fuel efficiency of the unit in question. Compact cars tend to boast a higher mileage while large units such as sport utility vehicles can require a significant amount of petrol.  This could very well eat into a limited budget.
Booking in Advance?
Advanced booking is the best way to save a significant amount of money.  Most of the larger firms allow you to make a reservation online weeks in advance.  Not only is this more economical, but the chances are high that you will be presented with a larger number of vehicles and “extras”.  A final benefit here is that this type of reservation is often associated with additional discounts of between ten and fifteen per cent.
Picking Up and Returning the Car
Always ask the rules and regulations associated with picking up and dropping off the car.  Some companies will require you to fill up the tank of petrol in order to avoid additional surcharges.  Also, ask if you are able to drop the car off at satellite locations or they instead require you to return it to the original rental destination.  Some firms ask that you clean the interior of the vehicle while others offer this as a complimentary service within the contract.
This is a comprehensive guide meant to streamline the entire car rental process.  It is still advisable to speak with multiple providers in order to secure the best deal possible.  In this manner, you can be assured that any upcoming trip will be pleasant and free from any unexpected surprises.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
