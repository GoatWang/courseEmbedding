Expert conversations

At Sentry, we’ve built our reputation on listening and providing assistance to all of our business customers. It’s in our DNA. And has been for more than 110 years.



                            Give us a call—let’s talk
                        















Dedicated service

Every company needs insurance protection for when things go wrong. But if you’re like us, you know there’s a bigger picture. We’re here to help you find the right coverage, manage claims, and develop a proactive safety culture to minimize risks.



                            Let us be your guide

Let’s face it. Insurance is not a one-size-fits-all solution. At least not here at Sentry. We get to know you and your business, offering innovative solutions that make sense for you.



                            Together, we can make it happen

    Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compound total returns net of fees (except for figures of one year or less, which are simple total returns) including changes in security value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any security holder that would have reduced returns. For Series I, Series O and Series O8, the stated rates of returns do not take into account the management fees and dealer/ advisor service fees payable directly by Series I, O and O8 securityholders that would have reduced returns. The performance of Series I, O and O8 would be lower if such fees were deducted from the holdings.  Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.

    Commissions, trailing commissions, management fees and expenses all may be associated with mutual fund investments. Please read the prospectus before investing. The indicated rates of return are the historical annual compound total returns net of fees (except for figures of one year or less, which are simple total returns) including changes in security value and reinvestment of all distributions and do not take into account sales, redemption, distribution or optional charges or income taxes payable by any security holder that would have reduced returns. For Series I, Series O and Series O8, the stated rates of returns do not take into account the management fees and dealer/ advisor service fees payable directly by Series I, O and O8 securityholders that would have reduced returns. The performance of Series I, O and O8 would be lower if such fees were deducted from the holdings.  Mutual funds are not guaranteed, their values change frequently and past performance may not be repeated.
