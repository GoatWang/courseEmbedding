The final race of the 148th Belmont Stakes is right around the corner, and we’ve gathered all the pertinent info about the Mount Everest of horse races. Here are 5 things you need to know about the huge equine event!
Are you ready for the third and most important Belmont Stakes event? The race of the year is happening tomorrow, June 11, which means there’s still plenty of time for you to learn all about it. Read on to find out about the race details, including the entertainment lineup, how to watch it, which horses are competing and more!

1. Tomorrow’s race is the final jewel in Thoroughbred horse racing’s American Triple Crown series.
The 148th running of the Belmont Stakes is 1 1⁄2-mile (2,400 m) long, and is sometimes referred to as “The Test of the Champion” or “The Run for the Carnations”. It’s held annually at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, and is one of the top attended racing events.
2. You can watch it live on TV!
The race will be broadcast by NBC beginning at 5:00 PM EDT, and you can check out pre-race coverage on NBCSN starting at 3:00 PM. Be sure to head to HollywoodLife.com to watch via livestream!
3. There’s no Triple Crown at stake this year.
Derby winner Nyquist lost in the Preakness due to illness — so sad! That means that no one horse will have won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes this year.
4. Rock band Daughtry will perform after the race.
Fortunately for people who aren’t too interested in the race but like to attend for the festivities, they’ll get to enjoy a performance by Daughtry! Attendees will also get to see a trackside performance from the popular Broadway musical BEAUTIFUL on Belmont Stakes Day.
5. 13 horses are competing in the race, with Exaggerator standing out as the favorite.
Governor Malibu, Destin, Cherry Wine, Suddenbreakingnews, Stradivari, Gettysburg, Seeking the Soul, Forever d’Oro, Trojan Nation, Lani, Exaggerator, Brody’s Cause and Creator have been preparing their whole horsey lives for tomorrow’s race!
Be sure to come to HollywoodLife.com tomorrow for full coverage of the Belmont Stakes!

 Stream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE
HollywoodLifers, will you be tuning into the race tomorrow? What are you most excited for?

Review


Of all of the fantastic horses this century has witnessed, it must have been a most difficult task to narrow down which of those were among the very best one hundred. However, the (Blood-Horse) magazine staff accepted the challenge to select the century's best.  Have you ever wondered where to find the race record of Dahlia (ranked 50th) for instance? Where can you find the pedigree for Sunday Silence (ranked 31st)? What great racehorse of the 1910s was sired by the farm's teaser stallion? By the way - the answer to that is Roamer (ranked 99th).  Opinion on "the greatest" will vary considerably, and a case can be made for almost any that are preferred. But within the covers of this book, you are sure to find the one that YOU think was "the greatest". And on his/her page you will also find a four-generation pedigree, tabulated race record, photographs, and a compelling narrative written by the talented editors of the Blood-Horse. You might even learn something you had not previously known, like I did while reading aboutRoamer's parentage.  We, the editorial staff of Thoroughbred Champions (the web site), give our most heart-felt accolades to Thoroughbred Champions (the book). -- ThoroughbredChampions.com, December, 1999

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGreat introduction to the sportByS. L. Shapiro Jr.on January 11, 2005Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseAfter having my interest in horse racing sparked a few years back by a Reader's Digest story on the Seabiscuit-War Admiral match race, I began looking for resources to learn more about the sport.  That's when I found this wonderful book.  I haven't seen enough races in my lifetime to dispute the order of selection, but what I can say is that if you want to learn about the greatest American racehorses of the last century, this is the place to start.  I have spent a lot of time on the internet and in libraries researching various horses, but I find myself going back to Thoroughbred Champions time and again.  My only wish is that somebody in Europe had done a similar book featuring the likes of Seabird 2, Ribot, Mill Reef, Nijinsky 2,Brigadier Gerard, Dancing Brave, Shergar, Hyperion, etc.  I don't gamble; I'm mainly interested in the achievements and stories of great horses and I find stories such as those contained in this book a wonderful way to enjoy the sport.  If the Seabiscuit movie or the Smarty Jones craze have piqued your interest in these wonderful athletes, then you'll want to get this book and learn about some of the finest racehorses ever to cross under the wire.  *** Since writing this review, Stephen Arnott was kind enough to recommend a book by Julian Wilson regarding European horses.  I've found the book and it's called "The Great Race Horses."  It's a perfect companion book to this one.  If you can't find it on Amazon, you might have luck, as I did, finding it at amazon.com.uk.  If you love to read about race horses, it is well worth getting.  Some of the greatest race horses ever never raced in America (the criteria for inclusion in Thoroughbred Champions).  As a race horse fan, I consider both of these books indispensible to my library.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsI love horses AND Thoroughbred racingByMichele Leylandon August 2, 2014Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI love horses AND Thoroughbred racing, and reading; this is one of my favorite books of ANY book I've ever read.  Not just full of facts and background info, but bits of trivia and tales about each of the 100 horses the book showcases.  Many pictures throughout, and bloodlines of each horse.  I re-read it every year around Kentucky Derby time.  If you love Thoroughbreds, you need to own this book.  I never tire of it and learn a new tidbit each time I peruse it.  Endlessly entertaining.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsA cherished addition to my collectionByTeddie Ann Reillyon January 31, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseSeveral years ago my beloved doctor lent me his copy to read as we were both into Thoroughbreds.

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 stars100 Great HorsesByAnimal Loveron November 5, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseThis is a fantastic book which highlights the top 100 racehorses of the 20th Century as complied by seven experts. Unfortunately some people may disagree on the final order as one expert did not even include Secretariat in his top ten. Secretariat is one if not the greatest racehorse of all time. We are a bit amazed that the fantastic Nijinski ll is not included even though he was the last winner of the English Triple Crown in 1970 and then retired to stud at Claiborne where he was an amazing sire, himself a son of Northern Dancer.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByPamela Hendersonon December 19, 2016Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseLoved the book, insight into their stories, the owners, everyone associated with them--fascinating book, thoroughly enjoyed it and learned a lot about these wonderful horses.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsFive StarsByC.Jacksonon January 15, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseVery well written and informative.

Portable Secure Storage




					Do you plan on storing:									


Guns / Ammunition



Valuables, documents and jewelry

Before answering the next question, please consider that a Security Cabinet or Safe can be a lifetime investment, consider how your gun collection may grow over time. Additionally, if you plan on securing ammo and other valuables,  the rule of thumb is to select a cabinet or safe that would accommodate double your anticipated long gun count. For example, if you foresee securing 10 long guns and want to use large portion of the cabinet or safe to store ammo and valuables, we would suggest at least a 20 gun cabinet or safe.How many Long guns / MSRs do you plan on storing ?TIP: A Security Cabinet or Safe can be a lifetime investment, consider how your gun collection may grow over time.
