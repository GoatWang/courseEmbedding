        Editorial: Proposed SunCoke Energy plant more likely than ever
    



Nov 3, 2014
 (…)




























































The proposed SunCoke Energy coke plant keeps getting closer and closer to moving from the talking and planning stage to the start of actual construction. While the project has not moved as quickly as many had hoped, Greenup County Judge-Executive Bobby Carpenter is right when he says the waiting “will be well worth it when we do get them here.”Note Carpenter’s use of the word “when” instead of “if.” Plans for South Shore coke plant have advanced so far it would be a major surprise — and an even bigger disappointment — if it is not built.In the latest step aimed at turning the proposed plant into a reality, SunCoke Energy South Shore LLC, of Lisle, Ill., is seeking approval for construction of a 90-megawatt plant in conjunction with the proposed coke plant to be built on about 250 acres along the Ohio River near South Shore. The company proposes building an electrical generation plant powered by efficient use of compounds left behind in the coke-making process. Approval of its construction would be a crucial step forward to Greenup County’s economic development, said Ashland Alliance President Tim Gibbs.
“It’s an important project,” said Gibbs, in response to the announcement Wednesday that the Kentucky State Board on Electric Generation and Transmission Siting has received an application requesting a construction certificate for the electric generating plant and an associated electric transmission line in northern Greenup County.“It’s a significant investment in Greenup and there will be some jobs involved as well,” Gibbs said, adding the proposed coke plant and power generation system offer significant advancements from traditional coke-making processes. “It’s so much more efficient. It’s more of a closed-loop system than we’ve seen in the past.”People in this region do not have to look far to get a good idea of what the new coke plant will be like. It will be modeled after the existing SunCoke Energy plant in Haverhill, Ohio, and that plant cannot be compared to the old AK Steel Coke Plant in Ashland coke and the old coke plant in New Boston, Ohio. Those two plants fouled the air for generations and were tolerated only because they provided good-paying industrial jobs.A modern shopping center that includes Walmart now stands on the site of the old New Boston plant, but it took years of cleanup to prepare that land for new development. Meanwhile, the AK Coke plant has been demolished and the property mostly cleared but environmental problems still must be eliminated before new construction can take place on the more than 100 acres on the site.When you hear of construction of a new coke plant on the shores of the Ohio River, don’t think of the old coke plants in New Boston and Ashland. The SunCoke Energy plant in South Shore will not be a duplicate of the Haverhill plant. Instead, it will include improvements added since the completion of that plant.






Hundreds of motorists drive past the Haverhill plant just off U.S. 52 without even noticing it. That certainly was not the case of the old plants in New Boston and Ashland: One sniff of the air and you knew where you were.Carpenter said SunCoke Energy “is just a number-one type of company,” with a proven environmental record. The county judge added the SunCoke project has been in the works for several years and will bring “good, high-paying jobs” to the region.SunCoke Energy South Shore LLC, a subsidiary of SunCoke Energy Inc., will produce coke used in steelmaking. Coke production involves heating coal to drive off volatile compounds, leaving behind a material that is pure carbon. The proposed SunCoke plant would capture and burn the volatile compounds to produce steam, which would drive a turbine to generate electricity.Connection to the electric grid would be via a 138-kilovolt transmission line to an American Electric Power Co. substation about a mile away in New Boston. The electricity would be sold on the open, wholesale market. The deadline to file requests for intervention, a formal evidentiary hearing or a local public hearing in the SunCoke Energy case, is Nov. 24. More information about the public participation process is available on the Siting Board website.Although we may be proven wrong, we can’t imagine the proposed plant being controversial. In many ways, it will simply help replace the ancient coke plants in Ashland and New Boston with a much, much cleaner and more efficient way to convert coal into coke. That’s a good thing.

        How do you feel about the proposed 911 fee in Boyd County?



The Boyd County 911 center needs help with funding. The center had relied on landline charges, but since residents are dropping landlines and switching to cell phones only, the center is facing a budget shortfall. At first, the fiscal court planned to attach a $48 per parcel fee. But some residents who own multiple parcels of property felt the fee was unfair and spoke out against it.
The county appointed a committee to try to find alternative ways to fund the center in the new year.

 SunCoke Proposes Plant In Greenup 
 Thu, 10/30/2014 - 1:28pm 
 Comments 
 by The Associated Press  

 



SunCoke Energy South Shore LLC has filed an application with Kentucky officials to build an electric generating plant in conjunction with a coke plant on about 250 acres along the Ohio River.The Independent reports the proposed plant in northeastern Kentucky would use the coke-making process to generate up to 90 megawatts of electricity that would be sold on the open, wholesale market.The Kentucky State Board on Electric Generation and Transmission Siting has begun reviewing the application to consider issues such as noise and economic impacts.The Kentucky Department for Environment Protection will also consider the application in separate proceedings to look at matters such as air emissions and water quality.Ashland Alliance President Tim Gibbs told the newspaper that the plant would benefit Greenup County's economic development."It's an important project," said Gibbs. "It's a significant investment in Greenup and there will be some jobs involved as well."He said the proposed plant would have more advanced methods than traditional coke-making processes, which involves heating coal to remove volatile compounds leaving behind only carbon.The plant would capture and burn the volatile compounds to make steam, which would move a turbine and create electricity."It's so much more efficient. It's more of a closed-loop system than we've seen in the past," Gibbs said.Lisle, Illinois -based SunCoke Energy South Shore LLC is a subsidiary of SunCoke Energy Inc., which produces coke for use in steelmaking.Persons or groups that want a public hearing on the proposed plant have until Nov. 24 to file a request with the state.
