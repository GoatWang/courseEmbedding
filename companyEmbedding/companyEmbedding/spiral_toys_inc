Description




Spiral Toys, Inc., formerly Rocap Marketing Inc., operates through its subsidiary, Spiral Toys LLC (Spiral). Spiral develops entertainment products that include both physical toys, as well as digital media. Spiral's mobile-connected entertainment platform connects physical items to mobile devices through wireless technologies. The Company specializes in connected technologies in entertainment products. The Company's products include Wiggy Piggy, TubeFriends, Lingos, StorytimePets, Battlekins and PillowTalker. The Lingos application allows parents and children alike to create their own stories and original scenes with a customizable, object-based layout. Storytime Pets is an augmented reality (AR) platform that allows children to use Apple and Android devices to read pages of a physical book. The StoryTime Pet reads the story back to the child as the mobile device recognizes the page of the book. Battlekins allows the player physically control the outcome of the game.

About Us


Spiral
Brings a bit of magic to familiar toys and creates entirely new kinds of fun. So far, we’ve made teddy bears that can have a conversation and turned stuffed animals into a way for children to communicate with parents and grandparents far away.
Soon, Spiral technology will be delivering new toys and entertainment devices that do things you may have never thought possible.


[/full_width_section]








What Is Spiral?

We live in a world where nearly everyone is carrying around a smartphone or tablet in their pocket, purse or backpack. By connecting these powerful mobile devices to toys and entertainment devices, we can create new ways to have fun that we could have never imagined just a few years ago.
The challenge is that connecting toys and entertainment devices to mobile devices and to the cloud is complicated, difficult and expensive. That’s where Spiral comes in.


Spiral makes it easy. Our service connects toys and entertainment devices with mobile devices and lets them easily communicate, interact, share and update content.
More than just a platform or a service, Spiral helps to create experiences. We’re not only experts in the hardware and software that makes these connections possible, we’re experts in creating brand-new experiences that deliver completely new kinds of fun.
Spiral works with companies and inventors to make their products come alive.

 


The Components of Spiral
 

A Platform
That lets entertainment device manufacturers easily make their products smart and mobile-connected.


An Ecosystem
For apps, digital content and an unlimited library of updates and new content for those mobile-connected devices.


A Team
That works with inventors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers to develop fun, successful mobile-connected entertainment devices.




Greetings!
First, let me start by saying thank you for your continued interest in Spiral Toys. We are an innovative toy company with some great tech and a lot of heart, but our success wouldn’t be possible without you—our customers, investors, partners and friends. We are thrilled to report that Spiral Toys is forging ahead to meet or exceed every goal we’ve set in the past several months. This success is a testament to the value of our products as they help bridge the distance between loved ones, provide connectivity across continents and allow us all to redefine what it means to be a digital community in the real world. Our innovative toys and apps are the result of years of industry experience, tons of market research and a company culture that values exploration and creative thinking above all else.
We look forward to continuing on the same exploratory course, building a bright future in perfect harmony with the ever-changing world. And we look forward to rolling out new technologies that promise to grow human connections across the globe.
At Spiral, community and connectedness are woven into the core of every invention and business transaction we make, and every human encounter we share.
A RETAIL ECOSYSTEM THAT BUILDS COMMUNITY
Spiral Toys touches the lives of kids and tweens in meaningful, personal ways. We do this by creating app experiences that bridge the divide between the physical and digital worlds and tap into the powers of community and feeling, friendship and fun. Spiral’s products are definitely meeting an essential need on a human level, but also an economic one.
The CloudPets™, for example, use Bluetooth Low Energy technology, and are manufactured in partnership with the toy company Jay@Play. Spiral collects initial revenue from each physical toy, and then continues to generate returns through the sale of great new apps and content to those same customers in the digital space.
We’re also developing the Vinyl brand, which will work in a similar way. The product embeds near field technology into physical stickers, with the result being an innovative new way for kids to share games, photos, music, videos and other fun digital content with one another. The “tagging” feature will enable kids to personalize each Vinyl and incorporate it into their social identity. Vinyl will create an entirely new way to use social platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to expand the reach of connected communities beyond the digital realm.
Spiral’s creation of new and engaging entertainment apps and social platforms designed to interface with physical items is resulting in an altogether new and amazing retail ecosystem—one that leverages retail sales and maximizes marketing efforts. It is the perfect blend of the physical and virtual worlds—and a recipe for a whole lot of fun.
SPIRAL TODAY & IN THE FUTURE
Spiral Toys was born out of a simple passion to build human connection through technology. Over time, this passion has evolved within our company, taking us from being a creator of technology to a creator of products, brands and experiences based on three main components—a Platform, an Ecosystem, and a Team. The Spiral Platform allows entertainment device manufacturers to make their products smart, fun and mobile-connected simply and easily. The Spiral Ecosystem is a constantly updated, unlimited body of apps and digital content for those devices. The group of great minds behind it all is the Spiral Team of inventors, manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Today, these three components combine to make Spiral Toys a 21st-century creator of virtual communities.
Following are a few of the most recent accomplishments that are setting the stage for Spiral’s exciting future.

On April 7, Spiral launched a $9.6 million national advertising campaign introducing our premier line of CloudPets™ Bluetooth Smart-enabled toys.


The U.S. campaign includes 30-, 60- and 120-second commercials, which are now running on some of the best-loved children’s networks out there, including Nickelodeon, The Cartoon Network, ABC Family and Disney XD.


By the end of 2015, more than 3,800 individual commercials will have introduced the world of CloudPets to millions of people in the U.S.


The U.S. campaign promises to bring amazing growth this year, and Spiral is extremely well positioned to receive it! Spiral Toys Hong Kong has increased its manufacturing capacity to make sure we’ll be able to put a cuddly CloudPet in the arms of every kiddo who wants one in the coming months.


We’ve now signed on the dotted line with the nation’s largest retailer, so we’re set to meet holiday on-the-shelf deadlines. This partnership will kick into full gear as early as June and will be nationwide by September.


Following the mass release of our CloudPets toys, we’ll start rolling out some great new content to kids and families. This will include games, stories, technology interactions and advanced messaging.


By opening our Hong Kong facility (devoted to lower-cost manufacturing) and our Canadian facility (devoted to lower-cost product development), we’ve secured some great tax credits and other benefits to help keep things moving along at lightning speed.


We’ve established partnerships with major manufacturers and distributors for two new projects.


We’ve filed several patents on technology innovations in Bluetooth LE and Near Field Communication (NFC). The sky’s the limit!

We are officially flying high as an industry leader in entertainment and the Internet of Things technologies! On behalf of everyone at Spiral, thank you again for taking the time to read this letter and learn more about Spiral and our incredible, one-of-a-kind products. Please be sure to check back regularly for more exciting updates—because they are surely headed down the pike—and we can’t wait to share them with you!

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
