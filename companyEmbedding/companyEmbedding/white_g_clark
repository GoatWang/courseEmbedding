224 KB|33 pagesProduct DescriptionThis novel study unit is an instructional tool for teaching the understanding, application, and assessment of reading comprehension skills/strategies and metacognitive strategies (Visualizing, Connecting, Summarizing, Questioning, Predicting, Evaluating).  It aligns with the Common Core Standards for ELA Literacy.

FREEDOM CROSSING by Margaret Goff Clark, is a historical fiction novel about an Underground Railroad border town and the struggles of conscience with the characters in dealing with the issues of the time.  (Great for connecting to current events.) Written with a great deal of dialogue, it is an ideal book for a Readers' Theater approach.  The unique feature of this novel study unit is the suggestions for role-play portions in each chapter. Also contained in the unit are an INTRODUCTION, detailing the use and function of the unit, PORTFOLIO CONTENTS sheet, CHARACTER TRAITS BUBBLE MAP, and TEST ANSWER KEY.

This 33-page novel study is a complete instructional plan for whole class, small group, reading circles, or home school use.  It integrates Reading/Language Arts, history, art, and drama through Lesson Suggestions, Discussion Questions, Activities, Research Suggestions and Tests.  Originally used by fourth grade Academically Gifted Students, it is perfect for grades 4, 5 and homeschool use.

DISCUSSION QUESTIONS work well in readers' circles and often contain mini-lesson suggestions.  

ACTIVITIES are independent and on-going; designed to meet a variety of learning styles and provide practice with Graphic Organizers (Maps, Venn Diagrams, Double Bubble Maps, Bubble Maps, Diagrams, Tables/Charts, etc.).  Activities are kept in student folders/portfolios; but some may be used for group bulletin board displays or PROJECT BOARDS for homeschoolers.  

TESTS are for assessment of reading skills and use of testing strategies (referencing text, eliminating unreasonable answers, selecting key words).  Always review in class after correcting.

Research topics include: Fugitive Slave Law, Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, Henry Clay, Frederick Douglass, and Bill of Rights.

This and other study units can be downloaded from Jan Z's Study Units on the TpT website.
