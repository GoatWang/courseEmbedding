If you’ve discovered you might need vision correction during your eye examination, it’s vital to determine just how “much” your eyes need to be corrected with lenses or contact lenses. This is called measuring your “refraction.” Autorefractors automatically measure this value during an eye examination.GlaucomaScanning laser polarimetry is the use of polarised light to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer as part of a glaucoma workup. The GDX is an incredibly effective tool for diagnosing glaucoma.Macular DegenerationMacular pigment plays an important role in protecting the cones in the back of the eye that are responsible for your central vision. The macula can “thin” over time due to age, but other factors like family history, and lifestyle choices may contribute to lower Macular Pigment Optical Density (MPOD), a key risk factor for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD).Laser Eye SurgeryNorthwest Ohio Vision Center works closely with many certified Ophthalmologists to provide outstanding pre and post operative care for patients undergoing surgeries such as Cataract Extraction and LASIK.CataractsAt Northwest Ohio Vision Center we provide complete eye care using the latest state of the art technology, allowing the doctors to diagnose nearsightedness and farsightedness along with many other sight threatening conditions such as glaucoma and cataracts.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareDiabetic RetinopathyThe doctors at Northwest Ohio Vision Center provide complete medical eye care.
