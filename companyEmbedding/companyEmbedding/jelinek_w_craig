Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]


Kirkland Signature logo






Kirkland Signature branded bottled water, pictured in 2005


"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]




Food concession stand at the Costco warehouse in Overland Park, Kansas


All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]


Kirkland Signature logo






Kirkland Signature branded bottled water, pictured in 2005


"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]

All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]

"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]




Food concession stand at the Costco warehouse in Overland Park, Kansas


All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]
Locations[edit]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]


Kirkland Signature logo

"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]




Food concession stand at the Costco warehouse in Overland Park, Kansas


All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]


Kirkland Signature logo






Kirkland Signature branded bottled water, pictured in 2005


"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]




Food concession stand at the Costco warehouse in Overland Park, Kansas


All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]
Products[edit]
Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]


Kirkland Signature logo






Kirkland Signature branded bottled water, pictured in 2005


"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]




Food concession stand at the Costco warehouse in Overland Park, Kansas


All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Costco's original logo. Used until 1993, but stores continued to carry the logo until 1997.


Costco Wholesale Corporation is the largest American membership-only warehouse club.[4] As of 2015, Costco was the second largest retailer in the world after Walmart,[5] and as of 2016, Costco was the world's largest retailer of choice and prime beef, organic foods, rotisserie chicken, and wine.[6]
Costco's worldwide headquarters are in Issaquah, Washington, but the company opened its first warehouse in nearby Seattle in 1983. Through mergers, Costco's overall corporate history dates back to 1976, when its former competitor Price Club was founded in San Diego, California.[7][8][9] As of 9 February 2017[update], Costco had a total of 729 warehouses, spread throughout the United States (508), Canada (94), Mexico (37), United Kingdom (28), Japan (25), South Korea (13), Taiwan (13), Australia (8), Spain (2), Iceland (1) and one in France (1).[1][10]

Price Club and the birth of the retail warehouse concept[edit]
Main article: Price Club
Costco's history began with Sol Price and his son, Robert, opening the first Price Club warehouse on July 12, 1976, on Morena Boulevard in San Diego, California, thus giving birth to a new concept: a retail warehouse club. The Price family placed Price Club Warehouse #1 inside a series of old airplane hangars[8][9] previously owned by Howard Hughes; that warehouse, now known as Costco Warehouse #401, is still in operation today.
Costco opens[edit]
Costco opened its first warehouse in Seattle, Washington, on September 15, 1983,[8] by James (Jim) Sinegal and Jeffrey H. Brotman.[11] Sinegal had started in wholesale distribution by working for Sol Price at FedMart and Brotman, an attorney from an old Seattle retailing family, had also been involved in retail distribution from an early age.[citation needed]
The "PriceCostco" merger[edit]
In 1993, Costco and Price Club agreed to merge operations themselves after Price declined an offer from Sam Walton and Walmart to merge Price Club with their warehouse store chain, Sam's Club.[12] Costco's business model and size were similar to those of Price Club, which made the merger more natural for both companies.[9] The combined company took the name PriceCostco, and memberships became universal, meaning that a Price Club member could use their membership to shop at Costco and vice versa. PriceCostco boasted 206 locations generating $16 billion in annual sales.[8] PriceCostco was initially led by executives from both companies, but then the Price brothers soon left the company in 1994 to form Price Enterprises,[9][13] a warehouse club chain in Central America and the Caribbean unrelated to the current Costco.[14]
In 1997, the company changed its name to Costco Wholesale Corporation and all remaining Price Club locations were rebranded as Costco.[8][9]

Other company milestones[edit]
On April 26, 2012, CNBC premiered its documentary, The Costco Craze: Inside the Warehouse Giant.[16]
In 2014, Costco was the third largest retailer in the United States.[17] That year Costco announced plans to open an online store in China using Alibaba Group.[18]
Costco today[edit]
In the United States, Costco's main competitors operating membership warehouses are Sam's Club and BJ's Wholesale Club.[19] Costco employs more than 205,000 people worldwide full and part-time employees.[3] In 2016, Costco had 85 million members.[20]
Costco was the first company to grow from zero to $3 billion in sales in under six years.[8] For the fiscal year ending on August 31, 2012, the company's sales totaled $97.062 billion, with $1.709 billion net profit.[3] Costco is 18th on the 2015 Fortune 500.[21] The ACSI (The American Customer Satisfaction Index) named Costco number one in the specialty retail store industry with a score of 84 in 2014.[22]
As of December 2013[update], Costco's board of directors is chaired by co-founder Jeffrey H. Brotman, and includes James Sinegal, co-founder and Director, and two officers of the company: President/CEO W. Craig Jelinek and CFO Richard A. Galanti.
Sales model[edit]




Costco warehouse interior in Mountain View, California


Costco focuses on selling products at low prices, often at very high volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item is essentially the same except when it has a house brand to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.[6]
If Costco management feels the wholesale price of a product is too high, they will refuse to stock the product. For example, on November 16, 2009, Costco announced that it would stop selling Coca-Cola products because the soft-drink maker refused to lower its wholesale prices.[23] Costco resumed selling Coca-Cola products on December 14, 2009.[24][25] Costco also saves money by not stocking extra bags or packing materials; to carry out their goods, customers must use a shopping cart, bring their own bags or use empty merchandise shipping boxes from the company's vendors.
Lighting costs are reduced on sunny days, as most Costco locations have several skylights. During the day, electronic light meters measure how much light is coming in the skylights and turn off an appropriate percentage of the interior lights. During an average sunny day, it is very normal for the center section of the warehouse not to have interior lights in use.[26]
Most products are delivered to the warehouse on shipping pallets and these pallets are used to display products for sale on the warehouse floor. This contrasts with retail stores that break down pallets and stock individual products on shelves. Most products have an 8% to 10% markup, while the Kirkland Signature brand products have a 15% markup.[27][28] The company runs very lean, with overhead costs at about 10% of revenue and profit margins at 2%.[6] It has no public relations department and does not buy outside advertising.[6] Costco's annual membership fees accounts for 80 percent of Costco's gross margin and 70 percent of its operating income, therefore Costco collects most of its profits 12 months in advance unlike most businesses.[29]
Membership[edit]
Costco stores are only open to members and their guests, except for purchases of gasoline and liquor in some U.S. states because of state law, optical prescriptions and prescription drugs because of federal law, and (in some regions) purchases made with Costco Cash Cards. While Costco welcomes guests to accompany members, only members are authorized to pay for items (unless the guests have Costco Cash cards).[30] Memberships purchases are paid in advance for one year.

In Australia, as of July 2009, membership is A$55 a year for a business membership, or A$60 a year for a Gold Star membership.[31]
In Canada, as of June 2017, membership is C$60 a year for a Gold Star membership and includes a card for a spouse, or CDN $120 a year for an Executive membership.[32]
In Mexico, as of December 2015, membership is Mex$450 a year for a Gold Star membership, or Mex$1000 a year for an Executive membership.[33] Costco is only open to members for all services and purchases. At Mexican locations, only purchases made with cash, the Mexican Costco credit card, MasterCard, or Visa debit cards are charged cash prices; purchases made with AMEX, MasterCard, and Visa credit cards incur a surcharge of 2%, and purchases made with a check incur a surcharge of 1.85%.[citation needed]
In Spain, as of April 2015, membership is €30 plus VAT a year for a Gold Star membership, which includes an additional card for no charge, or €25 plus VAT a year for a Business membership, which also includes an additional card for free.[34]
In the United Kingdom, as of July 2015, membership is restricted to certain groups only. Trade membership is available to the owners or managers of businesses for £20 (plus VAT). Trade members receive a complimentary spouse/partner card, and can purchase additional cards (at a cost of £12+VAT each) for employees. Qualified professionals, such as accountants, architects, dentists, doctors, engineers, opticians, pharmacists, surveyors, magistrates and solicitors, as well as employees in certain specific sectors (such as airlines, banking, the civil service, education, local government and medical services) may apply for individual membership, which costs £25 including a spouse/partner card. While these restrictions are posted in the store they are not applied rigorously; in reality any individual may apply for, and receive, a membership card.[35] A Costco card issued in another country is valid in the U.K.,[36] and as such, it would be possible for a U.K. resident to sign up elsewhere and use their card at home without meeting U.K. membership requirements.[citation needed]
In the U.S., as of June 2017, membership fees at Costco are US$60 per year for a Gold Star (individual) or Business membership, which can be upgraded to an Executive membership for an additional US$60 per year. All memberships include, free of charge, an additional card for a household member, an option to buy more cards for other members associated with the primary account holder, and additional benefits for Executive memberships, e.g., check printing services, home loans, some travel benefits, and vehicle insurance. Executive members also receive an annual "2% Rewards Check" of up to US$1000 from Costco on all purchases made, excluding select items such as gasoline, stamps, tobacco, and in some states, alcohol.

Policies[edit]
Forms of Payment[edit]
Cash Cards[edit]
Costco Cash Cards can be purchased in the warehouse or online,[37] and members can load them with money to make non-cash purchases at all Costco warehouses in Australia and the United States. Because Costco gas stations take only Visa credit cards (United States locations only), Costco Cash, debit cards, and MasterCard (Canadian locations only), people who can only pay for gas by check or cash must purchase a Costco Cash Card before filling up.
A Costco membership is not required to make purchases with a Costco Cash Card. A non-member may not purchase or re-load a Costco Cash Card; however, they may spend more than the total value of their cash card in-store provided they pay in cash or approved debit cards for the remaining balance.[38]
Credit cards[edit]
Online, Costco.com accepts Discover Card, MasterCard, PayPal Credit, and Visa cards.[30]
At Costco stores and gas stations, until June 19, 2016, American Express was the only accepted credit card in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, because Amex charged Costco very low interchange fees (a percentage of revenue from total sales made); as Costco's margins are low in comparison to other retailers'.[citation needed] Other forms of payment accepted at Canadian, United Kingdom, and U.S. Costco locations included cash, Costco Cash Cards, Costco credit cards, checks, EBT cards (both cash and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits), and PIN-based debit cards (Interac in Canada). Costco also accepts Flexible spending account (FSA) debit cards for qualifying purchases at the optical and pharmacy departments in the U.S.
On September 18, 2014 Costco Canada announced it would no longer accept American Express credit cards as of Dec 31, 2014.[39] Costco Canada entered into agreements with Capital One Canada and MasterCard Canada to replace American Express as the exclusive credit card accepted at its Canadian locations beginning Jan 1, 2015. The Capital One Mastercard doubles as a membership card but any issuer's MasterCard may be used.[40]
In the U.S. on February 12, 2015, it was announced that the 16-year partnership between American Express and Costco was to end after June 19, 2016. As of June 20, Costco no longer accepted American Express credit cards, and cardholders of TrueEarnings Costco-American Express cards were no longer able to use them anywhere after June 19, 2016. American Express mentioned that it and Costco had failed to reach an agreement that would have continued their partnership beyond June 19, 2016, the end date of their current contract.
On March 2, 2015, Costco announced that Citigroup Inc. would become the exclusive issuer of Costco's credit cards and that Visa Inc. would replace American Express as the credit card network for Costco’s stores starting on June 20, 2016. Costco accepts other Visa cards under the new agreement, as well.[41][42][43] The Costco Anywhere Visa Card by Citi functions as both a membership card and a credit card that can be used anywhere Visa cards are accepted (not just at Costco). The benefits of the Costco Citi Visa card include 4% back on gasoline purchases, 3% back on restaurant and eligible travel purchases, 2% back on Costco purchases, and 1% back on all over purchases. [44]
AmEx has been sued by shareholder Plumbers and Steamfitters Local 137 Pension Fund [45] lead for failing to reveal the expected financial impact on its firm of the loss of Costco business, which is expected to be substantial.[46] The Costco partnership represented 8%, or $80 billion, of AmEx's billed business and about 20%, or about $14 billion, of its interest-bearing credit portfolio, according to Richard Shane of JP Morgan Chase & Co.[43] The impact of this on AmEx was significant; in the first quarter without Costco cards lead to profit dropping 10 percent compared to the same period last year as well as revenue dropping 5 percent.[47]
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits in the U.S.[edit]
Until 2009, Costco did not accept Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) (formerly known as "food stamps"[48]). As of March 14, 2009, an article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted Jim Sinegal, co-founder and president of the company, as saying, "Generally we don't have customers who use food stamps."[49]
In response to the poor economy, as well as competitor BJ's Wholesale Club's decision in April 2009 to accept SNAP benefits chainwide,[50] Costco announced in May that year that it would accept SNAP benefits on a trial basis in two New York City stores, starting in June 2009, and depending on its success, might expand it to all New York City stores.[51] The company subsequently announced plans to expand the program beyond New York City, targeting first the "hard-hit areas like the "Central Valley of California", Indiana, and Michigan, expanding to "half its roughly 410 U.S. stores by Thanksgiving", and then going nationwide.[52]
Return policy[edit]
Costco memberships can be refunded in full at any time before they expire.[53] Costco guarantees almost all of their products with a full refund. Exceptions include cameras, camcorders, cellular phones, computers, digital audio players, projectors, televisions and major appliances; these may be returned within 90 days of purchase for a refund, for any reason. After 90 days those returns must be done through the manufacturer according to the terms of the warranty. Also exempted are tires (which are covered by their manufacturer's separate defects and treadwear warranties) and vehicle batteries (which are covered by either a Kirkland or Interstate brand warranty--Costco switched from Kirkland to Interstate batteries in 2014).[54][55][56][57][58] Costco has negotiated with manufacturers to extend the manufacturer's warranty to two years for new computers and televisions (five years on televisions sold by Costco in the UK).[53]

Costco has a wide variety of changing inventory and is known for carrying products for a time, then discontinuing them or using them as seasonal products.[citation needed] Over the years, Costco has gradually expanded its range of products and services. Initially, it preferred to sell only boxed products that could be dispensed by simply tearing the stretch wrap off a pallet. It now sells many other products that are more difficult to handle, such as art, books, caskets, clothing, computer software, fine wine, furniture home appliances, home electronics, hot tubs, jewelry, perishable items (such as dairy, fresh baked goods, flowers, fresh produce, meat, seafood), solar panels, tires, and vacuums. Many warehouses also have gas stations, pharmacies, hearing aid centers, optometrists, eye and sunglass centers, photo processors, and tire garages.
Some locations have liquor stores, often kept separate from the main warehouse in order to comply with liquor license restrictions. In some states (such as Texas), the liquor store must be owned and operated by a separate company with separate employees.[59] In 2006, Costco lost a lawsuit against the state of Washington in which it was seeking to purchase wine directly from the producer, bypassing the state retail monopoly.[citation needed] In Australia, Costco has to comply with regulations set by each state they choose trade in; their first store in the state of Victoria benefits from some of the most liberal alcohol licensing laws in the country, with retailers permitted to sell alcohol on shelves within the store, in a manner similar to most European countries. In the Canadian province of Quebec, beer and wine are sold within the stores from pallets.
Kirkland Signature[edit]

"Kirkland Signature" is Costco's private label. It is sold by Costco at their website and warehouses, and is trademarked by the company. The name is derived from the location (from 1987 to 1996) of Costco's corporate headquarters, Kirkland, Washington.[60]
Costco introduced Kirkland Signature as its private label in 1992. The idea was to provide brand name quality products at discounted prices.[61] To counteract the consumer confidence problem common in store branding, Kirkland Signature occasionally employs co-branding. According to Costco, while consumers may be wary of same-store-branding, they are less likely to be wary of brands that they are familiar with and trust.[62]
Notable other products[edit]
Costco is the exclusive first-hand distributor of Costco bears, which are manufactured by Hugfun International.[citation needed]
Publications[edit]
The Costco Connection is a magazine sent free to members of Costco; it can also be accessed online by anyone, free of charge.[63] The magazine, established in 1987,[64] features articles which regularly tie into the corporation along with business, celebrity features, cooking, entertaining, health, home improvement, and social articles, as well as coupons and ads. MediaPost reports: "While about 90% of the magazine’s advertising is co-op, increasingly national advertisers such as Procter & Gamble are buying space, notes Roeglin -- presumably because of the pub’s gargantuan reach and the data it has on its subscribers (whose average household income is $156,000 a year). 'We see about 56% of our subscribers a month buy something at one of our stores based on something they've read in the magazine,' says Roeglin."[65] The magazine is the largest-circulation print monthly in the United States.[65] Costco also publishes the Costco Household Almanac and a cookbook series.[66]
Services[edit]
Concierge service[edit]
Costco offers a free "concierge" service to members who purchase electronics, to help answer questions regarding setup and use and avoid potential returns due to not understanding how to use the products.[53]
Costco acts as an investment broker and travel agent. Costco has an agreement with Ameriprise for auto and home insurance. In 2004 Costco offered an original artwork by artist Pablo Picasso on their online store; more recently[when?] a highly regarded 1982 Mouton Rothschild wine was offered as well as other rare wines in rotation.[citation needed]
Costco Photo Center is a multi-functional photography printing lab offering services at the warehouses as well as through their web site, costcophotocenter.com. The website provides free unlimited digital file storage with a current membership. Previous to May or June 2010, Costco had an agreement with Mypublisher.com for custom book and calendar publishing. Now,[when?] they print the photobooks and calendars themselves.
Costco Auto[edit]
As of September 2015, Costco is the second largest auto seller in the US, just behind AutoNation.[67] Costco regularly teams up with various automobile manufacturers to offer special deals to customers, e.g., Polaris (a leading seller of powersport vehicles) in 4Q2015[67] and General Motors from October 2015 through January 2016.[68] Addicted to Costco lists the following as some benefits of the Costco Auto Program:[68]

A low, prearranged price for Costco members
All available national manufacturer incentives
An easy, hassle-free experience at more than 3,000 hand-selected dealerships nationwide
Dealerships that understand the program and their processes, and feature specially trained and certified Authorized Contacts to assist Costco members

Costco business services[edit]
On March 9, 2005, NOVA Information Systems (NOVA) partnered with Costco to market and support payment processing services to Costco Canada's Business Executive Members.[69]
Costco Optical[edit]
Costco Optical ranks as the fifth-largest optical company in the US, as of 2015.[70] Optometrists working at Costco locations will see patients without Costco memberships,[71] although a membership is required to fill a prescription at the optical department.[72]
Costco Travel[edit]
Costco Travel is a wholly owned subsidiary of Costco Wholesale and offers leisure travel to Costco members of the United States and Canada.[73] The program was established in 2000 as a service to Costco members. Costco Travel's offices are located in Issaquah, Washington, adjacent to Costco's corporate headquarters. Costco Travel employs over 700 travel professionals, all of them Costco employees.
The program offers vacation packages to the Caribbean, Europe, Florida, Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, and the South Pacific.[citation needed] Other products include car rentals, cruises, guided vacations, and theme park packages. Select products feature additional benefits for Costco Executive Members.[citation needed]
The program is marketed directly to Costco members through various Costco avenues, including the Travel Guide to Savings (found in all U.S. Costco warehouses) and in the Travel section of Costco.com.[citation needed]
Food service[edit]

All but a few Costco locations have a food court.[74] Some are inside, some are outside,[75] but the menu is essentially the same: hot dog with drink, pizza, frozen yogurt, various drinks, baked items, and sandwiches. Costco offers a quarter-pound 100% beef hot dog or Polish sausage and 591 millilitres (20.8 imp fl oz; 20.0 US fl oz) drink (with refills) for US$1.50, the same price since 1985.[76][77] In Australia, the hot dog is made of pork and is sold with a large soda for AUD$1.99. In Canada, the price for a hot dog and soda with refills is C$1.50.[78] In Mexico, the hot dog is made of 100% beef and includes a drink (with refills) for Mex$30. In the UK, the hot dog is also made from beef and customers also get a drink (with refills) for £1.50. Costco sold more than 82 million quarter-pound (113 g) hot dogs in its food courts in 2008.[78]
Cheese, pepperoni, veggie, or combo pizza is also available in most locations, and can usually be ordered to go, making Costco arguably the 14th largest pizza chain in the US in 2010.[79] Frozen yogurt is also served in chocolate, vanilla, or swirl. Costco also offers berry smoothies, latte freeze (without chocolate), mocha freeze (with chocolate), beef bake,[80] chicken bake, turkey provolone sandwiches, twisted churros, chicken Caesar salads, beef brisket sandwiches, beef chili with beans, and in some locations, gelato. French fries are also offered in some locations. Some of the food court items are only available in certain countries. For example, the bulgogi bake is only available in Japan and poutine is only available in Canada.[81][82] The nutrition data for the Costco Food Court items is posted online.[83]
Due to slow sales, in 2009 the pretzel was replaced by the churro.[84] In April 2013, Pepsi replaced all Coca-Cola fountain drinks at US locations because Coke had raised its prices; this helped keep the hot dog combo with soda at its original US$1.50 price.[85]
Online photo site[edit]
In December 2005, Costco signed an agreement with PhotoChannel Networks Inc., whereby Costco could deploy the PNI Digital Media Platform to offer online photo printing for Costco members through the website.[86]
On July 17, 2015 Costco disabled their online photo site.[87] In common with other retailers,[88] there is currently no confirmation about whether hackers had stolen Costco customers' photographs or data. As of August 1, 2015, Costco was estimating the website might return in mid August, after a four-week outage.[89]
Online shopping[edit]
On April 17, 2001, Costco Wholesale opened a B2B (Business to Business) online shopping site at costco.com for faster and easier business shopping.[90]
The domain costco.com attracted at least 58 million visitors in 2008, according to a Compete.com survey.[91] Costco.com is for United States members; costco.ca is for Canadian members, and other countries, such as Mexico, South Korea, and the UK, each has its own online Costco shopping website.
Instacart offers Costco delivery in a select number of states including Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and the District of Columbia. [92] No membership is needed to order from Costco on Instacart, but Instacart charges delivery fees and the prices may not necessarily be the same as in a Costco warehouse. Similarly, in March 2017, Costco initiated a partnership with Shipt, an online grocery delivery service. Unlike Instacart, Shipt charges its own membership fee, $99 a year or $14 a month, in exchange for free delivery on orders over $35. As of April 2017, Shipt only offers Costco delivery in the Tampa, Florida metropolitan area. [93]
Animal welfare concerns[edit]
In 2010, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at Buckeye Veal Farm, a veal supplier to Costco.[94] Immediately following the investigative release, Costco adopted a policy against purchasing veal from producers that use the crate-and-chain production method.[95] The case prompted Ohio lawmakers to vote in favor of a veal crate phase-out in the state.[96]
In 2012, Mercy for Animals conducted an undercover investigation at a pork supplier to Costco, Walmart, Safeway, Kroger, and Kmart.[97] Before the public release of the investigation, Costco announced they would begin requiring their pork suppliers to phase out gestation crates.[98][99]
In 2015, The Humane Society of the United States conducted an undercover investigation at an egg supplier to Costco.[100] An undercover worker at Hillandale Farms, a major egg supplier to Costco, filmed conditions in which egg-laying hens lived in tiny, wire cages. [101] Following the investigations, several celebrities including Brad Pitt and Ryan Gosling publicly wrote to Costco to address this issue.[102] Following efforts by animal protection nonprofits include The Humane League,[103] Costco released an updated commitment to source exclusively cage-free eggs in its operations.[104]
In 2016, a follow up to Costco's shift to cage-free eggs by animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) reported cannibalism and high mortality at a cage-free Costco egg supplier.[105][106] Costco denied the allegations, but the video sparked a discussion about animal welfare problems continuing to exist at cage-free egg farms.[105] Writing in the Huffington Post, DxE co-founder Wayne Hsiung argued that the new investigation, rather than suggesting that Costco should keep birds in cages, indicated that hens should have the right not to be raised for food or kept on farms at all.[107]
Labor relations[edit]
While some former Price Club locations in California and the northeastern United States are staffed by Teamsters,[108] the majority of Costco locations are not unionized although there seems to be a move in 2012 to unionize some locations in Canada.[109] The non-union locations have revisions to their Costco Employee Agreement every three years concurrent with union contract ratifications in locations with collective bargaining agreements. The Employee Agreement sets forth such things as benefits, compensations, wages, disciplinary procedures, paid holidays, bonuses, and seniority. The Employee Agreement is subject to change by Costco at any time and offers no absolute protection to the workers. As of March 2011[update], non-supervisory hourly wages ranged from $11.00 to $21.00 in the U.S., $11.00 to $22.15 in Canada, and £8.50 to £11.50 in the United Kingdom. In the U.S. as of 2005, eighty-five percent of Costco's workers had health insurance, compared with less than fifty percent at Walmart and Target.[110] Health benefits include coverage through Aetna, remote primary care through Teladoc, second opinions and clinical navigation by Grand Rounds, and wellness coaching by Omada.
Product-demonstration (e.g., food samples) employees work for an outside company. In the western U.S., the company is called Warehouse Demo Services, Kirkland, Washington.[111] Costco also uses Club Demonstration Services, based in San Diego, California.[112] In Canada, demonstrations are done exclusively by Professional Warehouse Demonstrations.[113] Demonstration employees receive a pay and benefit package that is less than that of Costco employees.As of August 1st 2017 demonstrations/samples will be provided by CDS in Canada.[114]
In 2014, The Guardian reported that Costco is a client of Charoen Pokphand Foods. Over six months, The Guardian traced down a supply chain from slave ships in Asian waters to leading producers and retailers. Costco has published a statement saying it has had a supplier code of conduct since 1999 which does not allow this practice, and that independent auditors check for violations regularly.[115][116][117][118]
International locations and other centers[edit]
Warehouses outside the US are similar to those in the US. Layout, signage, and even parking lot markings are generally identical to warehouses in the US.[citation needed] Food court menus are tailored to international tastes, with meat pies on offer in Australia, poutine in Canada, seafood-topped pizza in Asian and Mexican locations, clam chowder in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, and jacket potatoes in the UK.[119] Additionally, Costco has led a strategic initiative within the past year to enhance their merchandise mix available within international warehouses to tailor products to local tastes, with a mix of both American and local products available.
Expansion worldwide[edit]
Costco announced it was opening 28 new locations in 2013, the most in one year since 2007.[120]
Largest location[edit]
In 2005, the world's largest Costco was located in Hillsboro, Oregon.[121] In 2015, Costco completed an expansion in Salt Lake City, UT, making it the new largest Costco at 235,000 square feet.[122] In 2011, Costco's highest volume store was in Seoul, South Korea.[123]
Costco Business Centers[edit]
Costco Business Centers are warehouses similar to regular Costco warehouses, and are open to all Costco members, regardless of membership type. Their merchandise, though, cater predominantly to enterprises, with a focus on small businesses. Business Centers do not carry most consumer items like clothing, jewelry, media, and tires, while carrying larger quantities and more options for the business products they do carry.[124] They do not offer most of the consumer-oriented services found at regular Costco warehouses, but some locations do have a food court or a gas station or both. Also unlike regular warehouses, most Costco Business Centers have a Print & Copy Center which provides printing professional services. They have large parking spaces for trucks and are capable of delivering goods to businesses in bulk quantities. Finally, opening hours are shorter than regular warehouses (usually opening at 7 am on Mondays to Saturdays and closed on Sundays), while discounts and coupons for Business Centers are issued separately from regular warehouses.[citation needed]
Locations[edit]
As of August 2016, there are 15 Costco Business Centers in the United States, located in Orlando, Florida; Phoenix, Arizona; California (Commerce, Hawthorne, Hayward, San Diego, and Westminster); Denver, Colorado; Morrow, Georgia; Bedford Park, Illinois; Hackensack, New Jersey; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Washington (Lynnwood, and Fife). A Costco Business Center is projected to open in North Hollywood, California in July, 2017.[125]
The first Costco Business Centre in outside the US opened in Canada in Scarborough, Toronto in spring 2017.[126]
Discontinued concepts[edit]
Costco Home[edit]
The first Costco Home warehouse debuted in 2002 in Kirkland, Washington. The warehouse's concept was to combine the value, setting and members-only elements of Costco's warehouse clubs with the product array one would find at an upscale home store, such as Fortunoff or Crate & Barrel. The Costco Home warehouses sold furniture, housewares, kitchen products and accessories from higher-end brands such as Lexington, Ralph Lauren and Waterford[127] in a warehouse-club setting. Costco claimed that, similar to its main warehouses, it accepted lower margins in return for greater volume with minimal overhead.
Over time, the concept was adjusted to include home electronics, some major appliances, office furniture, and a large selection of outdoor furniture and window treatments. Costco also partners with Glentel subsidiary WIRELESS etc. to sell mobile phones and plans in Canada and Wireless Advocates in the US.
On April 2, 2009, the company announced that it would be abandoning its Costco Home concept, closing the two existing stores in Kirkland, Washington and Tempe, Arizona on July 3, 2009, and abandoning plans for a third store on the West Coast.[128] The company cited cutbacks in consumer spending on home products and its interest in focusing on its core business as the main reasons.

Q&A With Costco's CEO, W. Craig Jelinek
You asked Costco’s chief: Why no express lanes?
Published: October 2014 











Costco's CEO, W. Craig Jelinek

To call Costco a store is an understatement: While stocking up on paper products and pantry staples, the retailer’s 74.5 million cardholders can also get an eye exam, book a cruise, and even buy life insurance. Its fans are fiercely loyal, and its critics (members and nonmembers alike) have strong opinions about everything from its annual membership fee to its food court’s switch from Coke to Pepsi. When we announced that Costco’s CEO, W. Craig Jelinek, would field reader questions, the e-mails and Facebook messages poured in. Here, a selection of his answers.
Q. Has Costco considered letting nonmembers shop there—perhaps once every few months?—Yuval Fleming, Kent, WA
A. It’s not a workable possibility. First, we believe it would compromise the under­lying premise of the membership concept. Second, the basic $55 annual fee covers a variety of membership, administrative, and operating costs, thereby allowing Costco to sell merchandise at ever-lower prices. Costco’s average merchandise markups are in the 11 percent range, compared with other retail-format markups ranging from 20 percent to more than 100 percent. The annual cost of membership is dwarfed by the annual savings.
Q. I enjoy products from Costco’s Kirkland Signature store brand, but I feel some get dropped prematurely, before they’re given a chance to click with consumers. What’s the criteria for whether a Kirkland product sticks around?—Thomas Gruber, Seattle
A. The basic criteria for a new Kirkland Signature item: It must be as good or better in quality than the comparable branded item, and it can be offered to our members at a price at least 20 percent lower than we would sell the branded item. We try to ensure all of our members are able to try the new item through our demo/sampling program. After nine months to a year, we measure its weekly sales generated per building. If it doesn’t meet targets, we delete the item—as we would any item we sell.
Q. Costco sells everything in huge sizes—except clothes. Thirty percent of Americans are seriously overweight, yet for all the 5-pound cans of cheese sauce and 24-count packages of ice-cream bars, there is almost no plus-size clothing in the stores. What gives?—Jenny Reiswig, San Diego
A. Over the past year, we have tested apparel items in plus sizes in about 60 percent of our U.S. warehouses; moving forward, we have decided to focus on expanding plus-size assortments on Costco.com. Current women’s items include Kirkland Signature active wear, Gloria Vanderbilt pants and shorts, as well as various styles of dresses, tanks, and tops. For men, the focus is also on carrying a year-round assortment of big and tall items on Costco.com, including Kirkland Signature dress shirts, wool dress pants, casual cotton pants and jeans, and soft-shell jackets.
Q. As a corporation making billions of dollars in profit each year, you are benefiting from shrimping exploitation in Thailand. Those fishermen are forced to work without pay on fishing boats, sometimes for years on end. They work 20-hour shifts and endure beatings. Will you institute a zero-tolerance policy on slavery?—Carole Shelton, Auburn, CA
A. We are very aware of recent media reports concerning labor abuses in the Thai fishing industry. The agreements that Costco has with its suppliers prohibit, among other things, use of slave labor. We are committed to working with our suppliers of Thai shrimp to require them to take corrective action with respect to poor labor practices. This commitment so far has involved visits by our buying staff to Thailand and discussions with the Thai government, our suppliers, and other industry participants. We are continuing those discussions.
Q. Why, in the name of all that is holy, don’t you have an express lane in your warehouses? Often I buy two items only to be stuck behind people with two over-full carts.—S. Culos, Toronto
A. Costco’s ability to sell merchandise at incredibly low prices is based on adhering to various operating disciplines at every turn. Instead of having an express line—that often would be open but without a member in line—we have invested millions of dollars to speed up the entire front-end process. Our policy is “no more than one (member) in line and two (members waiting) behind.” The average completed front-end transaction is just over 1 minute.

Petition ClosedPetitioning  Craig Jelinek and 1 otherDecision makersCraig JelinekW. Craig JelinekStop selling toxic RoundupRussell Weiler Ashland, ORRussell WeilerAshland, OR153,880SupportersGlyphosate, the main ingredient in Monsanto’s Roundup, is the most used herbicide on earth. From mass agriculture to backyard gardening, it is sprayed on most of the produce we cultivate. So much so, in fact, that a sampling of waterways in 38 states found glyphosate in the majority of rivers and streams tested. It was also found in about 70 percent of rainfall samples. Perhaps most disturbingly, some studies have even found elevated levels of glyphosate in American women’s breast milk.
For years, the Environmental Protection Agency deemed glyphosate non-harmful to humans. But now, an agency of the World Health Organization has declared that it “probably” causes cancer in people. And a new study found that Roundup’s other ingredients amplify the toxic effect on human cells—even at concentrations much more diluted than those used on farms and lawns.
In the wake of these studies, whole countries, like Sri Lanka, Brazil, Mexico and the Netherlands, are restricting or fully outlawing Roundup use. The U.S. has yet to do anything about it. But there is one American company that has declared its commitment to conscious consumer practices, and it should lead the charge in removing Roundup from its shelves.
Costco has stopped selling eggs from caged chickens, and worked hard to become the country’s largest retailer of organic foods. Let’s call on Costco to keep up the good work and remove dangerous Roundup from its retail inventory.
Costco’s CEO Jim Sinegal is known as a renegade among retail executives because of his diehard commitment to good corporate citizenship. From higher than average hourly wages and outstanding health benefits for workers, to careful selection of the products the store chooses to carry, Costco has risen above the crowd and shown the U.S. that it's fifth largest retailer can be successful and socially responsible all at once.
Jim Sinegal has another great chance to demonstrate his values by treating Roundup as the carcinogenic and environmentally disastrous toxin that it is.

An Interview With Costco CEO Craig Jelinek
After 18 months at the helm, the Costco CEO discusses the company’s history and its current success.











                Austin Smith
            

                (TMFBWItime)



            
            Aug 1, 2013 at 9:31PM
            
            





The Fool chats with Costco (NASDAQ:COST) CEO Craig Jelinek. Craig first joined the company as a warehouse manager in 1984, quickly rising to become a regional manager and then advancing through various executive posts over the years. He became president and COO in 2010, and took over from longtime CEO Jim Sinegal in January 2012.
Craig shares his experiences with Costco, the philosophy behind the retail giant's success in the U.S., and its experiences in markets from Canada to Taiwan.
 
Austin Smith: Hey, Fools, Austin Smith here and I'm joined by Craig Jelinek, the new CEO of Costco. First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to sit down with us today.
Craig Jelinek: Glad to do it.
Austin: I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I believe Costco was the first-ever recommendation in our flagship newsletter, by our CEO, so we have a deep love for the company. We've loved Costco for years, so we really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us and our members today.





Jelinek: Well, we appreciate that, and I hope you shop with us also.
Austin: I am a proud Costco member, and please keep the price of the hotdog and soda at $1.50. I know it hasn't changed, and I hope that now that you're at the helm you don't want to shake it up and make it $1.75.
Jelinek: Trust me, that's never going to change. If I have to subsidize it personally, it's not going to change.
Austin: I like that. I'm wondering; obviously a big transition. Now that you're at the helm, I'm wondering what's changed for you, as you're leading this great company forward?





Jelinek: Well, I don't know that a lot has... Obviously, a lot's changed because the buck stops with me. But as you know we've got Jim was a founder. We've got a very strong culture. Most of us have worked with the company in key executive positions for 28-29 years.
I'm very fortunate. Obviously, those are big shoes to fill, but we've got a great management team and things have moved on accordingly. Before Jim stepped down, I was president for two years, and we talked about what the future looked like and thought through a game plan, so I think we're well equipped for the next 15-20 years.
Austin: Obviously, you and Jim worked very closely over the years.
Jelinek: We have.





Austin: You've probably learned a lot from each other. What other really great retail executives -- or executives in general -- have you guys found inspiration from, that you admire in the industry?
Jelinek: Well, I think when you talk about Sol Price, who was the originator or founder of Price Company, and FedMart, one thing that we both learned from him is continue to always do what's right for your employees and always try to do what's right for the consumer.
If you keep the consumer and your employees and do the right thing, things have a way of working out for you. You build trust with your employees, you build trust with your consumer -- which is really just common sense and good business -- but I think that's probably what we learned the most. Just always do the right thing.
This isn't rocket science. You just want to continue to bring the value to the consumer. You want to pay good wages, you get good people, treat people fairly, and if you can keep your expenses down, you keep your prices down, you're going to sell a lot of merchandise and that's what we do: buy and sell goods.
Austin: Pretty simple formula, it sounds like.
Jelinek: It's simple. The hard part is keeping it simple.
Austin: You guys are one of the rare companies that left all your stakeholders very happy -- your customers, your employees, your shareholders. As you think about all the people who are affected from Costco's day-to-day operations, where do you start? Is it with the customer? Is it with your employees? Who do you start with?
Jelinek: Well, it's a combination of both. Obviously, before you ever open up your doors, you have to start with your employees and you have to have suppliers. But the bottom line is, if you look at our mission statement, you take care of your customer, your member. You take care of your employees. You take care of your suppliers. Actually, the first thing is always, obey the law.
Then if you do all those things, you're going to reward the shareholders. That's always been our philosophy. If you get too short-sighted and you want to reward your shareholders as the most important thing, chances are you're not going to be in business in five or 10, 15 years.
Our view is we want to have a company for the long haul and continue to grow the sales and grow the profits fairly and make sure there's always opportunity for our employees to grow. If you look at the last 30 years, our stock has grown about 15%-16% a year in value, and we think we've got a pretty fair return for our shareholders.
Austin: Pretty good clip. You can't be upset with that sort of return.
Jelinek: No. We think it's been more than fair, and we think we've got a business model that's going to last us for a long time.
Austin: One of the, in my opinion, most impressive statistics that I see about your company is the amazing renewal rates -- upward of 90%, I believe, most recently.
Jelinek: Right. We're 89 high, so we're close. If you round it, we're at 90% in the U.S. and in Canada and we're in the mid-70s in our international part of the business, which is Asia, which actually is considered to have improved considerably.
Austin: Interesting. How do you guys achieve that amazing retention? It's absolutely phenomenal customer retention. How do you guys cultivate that number year after year after year?
Jelinek: Well, the consumer pays for a membership and they make that decision based on what they figure the value of the membership is. I think if you continue to bring value to the consumer and bring quality to the consumer, and know the consumer knows if the item doesn't perform well they can bring it back.
You build trust with the consumer, and I think it's really that simple. They like what they see, and they continue to renew. If they won't like us, they don't like what they see, they're not going to renew, so I think if you look at it they like it, so they're renewing.
Austin: Right.
Jelinek: It's kind of simple. I don't know how else to put it.
Austin: When I think about your company, I think of things like high renewal rate, great customer service, low prices -- but then I also think about Amazon the very same way. I'm a happy Costco member and an Amazon Prime member.
You guys both have phenomenally low prices, you're both notoriously very customer-focused, keep Wall Street at arm's length and focus on the products and service first.
How do you guys see Amazon? Are they a threat? Are they a complementary retailer? How do you think about them in the landscape today, because they seem to be the retailer that has the most closely espoused your virtues of low prices and customers first?
Jelinek: Well, if you look at anybody that sells anything, they're a threat. Anybody in business that sells merchandise is a threat. What we have to continue to do, we think we offer two avenues.
We have our core brick-and-mortars, where you can come in and shop particularly and buy a lot of fresh foods, a lot of wine, health and beauty aids, things like that. Then we've got the non-food assortment. In fact, if you want to buy online, you have the ability to also shop with us online, in terms of buying TVs and general merchandise.
We still think, day in and day out, we bring the best value in the marketplace, and you've got two options. You also have an easy option if you want to bring the merchandise back. You can bring what you bought online and you can bring it into the warehouses to return.
We think we can compete well with Amazon. There's always going to be, in my view, two forms of retail: brick-and-mortars and online. But I think it's always going to be very difficult -- although people test it -- I think buying and distributing food and sundries and fresh foods in the marketplace, overall, is going to be difficult to do and very expensive.
Austin: Looking at your positioning, then, the retail landscape is obviously changing dramatically. A lot of things being done online.
Do you view a brick-and-mortar competitor like Wal-Mart or an online-based competitor like Amazon as maybe a bigger concern or a bigger threat to Costco's model?
Jelinek: I think, like I said before, they're both threats, as is Target a threat, as is Whole Foods a threat.
The key is being the low-cost provider. That's going to be the key for anybody winning the battle long term. It's whoever can bring value and bring the best quality of merchandise to the marketplace at the best price. I think that's really the key.
Austin: What do you think is the most misunderstood thing about Costco today, that you just keep hearing and you're like, "Oh, that's not the case"? Is there a common misunderstanding about your business that you see?
Jelinek: I don't think there's really a misunderstanding. We're always... you used the word, "They're a discounter." Well, when you say that we are a discounter, we bring quality merchandise to the marketplace at a very good price.
We have department store-type items that we bring to the marketplace. It's not like it's inexpensive or cheap merchandise. I think, over time, that has taken care of itself. The people know that we have quality merchandise at a very good price. They're not seconds, they're not closeouts. It's quality merchandise that you can buy at most department stores or high-end stores at a very good price.
If you look at our jewelry, if you look at our watches, if you look at our sporting goods, if you look at our television sets, it's all quality, name-brand merchandise. If you look at our private-label merchandise, our Kirkland Signature, that's equal to or better than national brands, at a better price.
Austin: You guys obviously participate in a huge spread of the retail space -- electronics and jewelry and food, as you mentioned. What are the biggest defining trends in retail that you guys are seeing going on today? Is it private-label consumption, is it organic consumption, that investors may want to get ahead of, if they see these changes happening?
Jelinek: Well, there's two things. Organic, in my view, is here to stay. But also, organic is also very expensive. Our view is to figure out, always, how to bring organics at a better value or a better price to the marketplace. Kirkland Signature, we're looking at Kirkland Signature Organics. We're looking at being able to do that.
I think both. I think the private label or controlled label, as long as it's quality, is going to become a bigger part of the business because I think, more and more, brands... not so much in the non-food that they'll be big, because brands are still very important because there's so much advertisement out there on brands.
Austin: On the foods end?
Jelinek: No, non-foods. But on the food part of the business, I think more and more if there's trust in the house that sells it, there'll be trust in the brand. I think that's one of the things that we've got going for us, that we've got trust in there in the Kirkland Signature name.
If you look at that name, it's just not in a few items. That Kirkland Signature is from diapers to luggage to meat to vitamins. It's a pretty brand name that covers a lot of merchandise, so you have to be careful to make sure that you protect the integrity of every item that you sell, so you don't lose the reputation on that Kirkland Signature brand.
Austin: Makes a lot of sense.
Jelinek: But we've been able to protect it, and I think there's a lot of confidence in the Kirkland Signature. When we first went to it about 22 years ago, it was very slow, but now anything that we put Kirkland Signature brand on, people are not concerned about trying it.
Austin: Do you see any other big paradigm shifts in retail, that we didn't talk about, just as you observe the landscape?
Jelinek: You know, like I said, I think you're going to probably see a lot more organics. I think people, particularly depending on what economic level they are, are going to buy healthier, cleaner ingredients. I think organic produce is very big for us.
The problem is, if we just dealt in organic produce, we would never have enough produce to get by in a given week, let alone a year. It's all about availability. I think over time you'll see, probably, more production being shifted to organics, but that's going to take time.
Austin: How do you personally evaluate the success of Costco?
Jelinek: I think there's a couple things. You can evaluate... success is a lot of different things to a lot of different people. I think if you look at it, that if you can continue to provide value to the consumer, your business is going to continue to grow.
If your business continues to grow, you're going to provide opportunity for your employees. If you can provide opportunity for your employees, your employees are also going to be able to grow, they're going to be able to support their families, and enjoy a better quality of life.
If those things happen, you will just continue to reward the shareholders. Our whole view is, I want to be able to go in the food court, 25 years from now when I'm old with my walker, and sit down and say, "I remember you when" to some of our employees.
 That's very important, to be able to create a company long term that's going to continue to grow and provide opportunities. Yet you'll do that by taking care of the member and creating them great value.
Austin: In the evaluation of Costco from your perspective, are there any metrics that you look at that investors may not necessarily be aware of? Same-store sales is one of the obvious metrics to look at in retail, but what do you look at internally, in evaluating Costco's success?
Jelinek: Well, certainly you look at your comp business. You also look at your renewal rate. That's very important. We also try to look at the growth that we see. We're always measuring.
We think the model will work, as it has worked in a lot of other countries. No matter what country you live in, you want to be able to buy merchandise at the best possible price, so we certainly are looking at that.
Our employee turnover -- which is less than 1% at the management level and less than 5% in the overall hourly level -- I think is a very important piece for us, which talks about employee satisfaction.
Those are some of the things that we always look at.
Austin: OK. I wonder if you could explain the dynamics, in terms of purchasing power, that allows you guys to continually offer the lowest prices for consumers. Because technically, on paper, it would look like Walmart or Amazon might be able to out-purchase you, but you guys are able to consistently provide a more affordable product in many instances. I'm wondering if you could explain that disconnect?
Jelinek: Well, keep in mind it's not always how you purchase goods. You've got to purchase goods, and you purchase at the best possible price, right?
Now, when you look at our sales per item, they're much greater than Amazon or probably Walmart, because we only have less than 4,000 items, where if you look at our competitors they have substantially more items -- maybe eight or 10 times more than the 4,000, where the math doesn't work in terms of sales.
With that being said, we think we can bring efficiencies to a supplier which allows us to sometimes buy a certain item at a better price, but also our SG&A, which is what it costs us -- our administrative costs -- is less than 10%.
There's probably nobody close to us in terms of SG&A in the retail environment, that has a better SG&A than we do. If you look at Wal-Mart they're probably about 18% and I think Amazon is probably at a 22%-23%, although they both have other means of margin revenue coming in.
But it's just as important to be efficient, to lower your expenses, because then you can work off of less margin in terms of selling merchandise.
Austin: Makes sense. Are there any retailers -- in the broader space at all -- that you really admire, that you see and you say, "Wow, they really got it right," or "I admire their operations?"
Jelinek: I think Amazon's done a good job in terms of building a brand with their customer service. I think they've done a very good job of that. I think Whole Foods has got their niche, in terms of quality merchandise, and I think Trader Joe's is a company that pays very good wages. They've got limited selection and they've got great quality merchandise, and they've got a great reputation out there with the suppliers, so I think they've done a very good job.
Even a company called Aldi, which is starting to come to the U.S. -- they're a private company -- but they're a very simple operation that cuts a lot of overhead out and they've been very good at bringing merchandise to the market at a very low price.
Austin: You've got to appreciate that then.
Jelinek: Absolutely. That's the name of the game.
Austin: What's your favorite item on Costco's shelves today?
Jelinek: You know, I love our hot dog. There's no place else you can get a better item for $1.50.
Austin: That's true.
Jelinek: I like our toilet paper, because obviously that's the No. 1 selling item that we have. And I love our Kirkland Signature shirts. That's the only thing that I basically wear, like this.
Austin: I assume this is one today.
Jelinek: This is it. I think that's become a great item for us. It's become a big volume item for us. When I really notice, when I get excited, is when I go to pick up my dry cleaning and I see all the shirts in there that look like mine. I know that that shirt is being purchased out there in the marketplace.
Austin: I'm a big fan of the Kirkland label, but I have to say I've got trouble with the slim fit. I haven't been able to make it work. If you guys have anything in the pipeline, let me know because I'd buy my shirts there all day.
Jelinek: We have slim fits.
Austin: You're a slim. What about extra slim? European slim?
Jelinek: You're a rarity.
Austin: Yes. No plans for that?
Jelinek: No plans for that at the moment. I don't know how many people would fall into that category.
Austin: There's not many of us. We're not big purchasers. You would not do well to target that niche.
What about, when Christmas time rolls around, what are you putting in the family stockings from Costco?
Jelinek: Well, you know, when I grew up, you put toothbrushes and socks and stuff like that in the Christmas sock. But TVs are becoming very big for us. We sell a lot of Bose speakers. The tablets, Samsung tablets are becoming very big.
We sell a lot of apparel during the Christmas season. We sell a lot of jewelry, we sell a lot of watches during the holiday season, so that will continue to be big for us. Our domestics business... I would say vacuum cleaners, but that's probably not a good thing as a Christmas present or Mother's Day present.
Austin: No, that gets you in the doghouse pretty quickly.
Jelinek: This day and age, but our jewelry business continues to grow, our apparel business, items like that.
Then again we're very big during the holiday season, particularly with our prime rib and our fish items, our shrimp, items like that. We do a big job -- hams -- during the Christmas season.
Austin: You mentioned your electronics section and the strong Samsung presence you have. When I look across the consumer electronics landscape today, it's hard to ignore the Apple presence that Apple has. But Apple seems notably absent from Costco.
How is that dynamic shaking out? Are you guys trying to target Apple? Have you thought about bringing them in?
Jelinek: I think it's ... we always continue, occasionally, to have dialogue and to see if somehow we can show a value for the Apple products. So far we haven't been able to work out something. Time will tell if that happens, but we seem to be doing well without each other.
Apple's doing well without being in Costco, and Costco seems to thrive with not having Apple. It's going to work out for each one, one way or the other. If it doesn't work where we can work with each other, it doesn't work. That's OK. Life goes on.
Austin: Looking at some of your operating metrics, it's hard to miss the extreme efficiency you guys seem to be getting out of Canada, compared to your U.S. business. I think the average sales per Canadian citizen compared to a U.S. citizen are about two times, approximately. What are you guys doing up in Canada that's working so well?
Jelinek: Well, there's a couple things.
If you compared Canada to the West Coast, you would probably see that they're pretty similar because we're so well entrenched in the West Coast. We're not really going into any new markets in Canada. Everything's basically tied around the Vancouver, the Winnipeg, smaller markets.
If you look at the Midwest and the Southeast, some of those buildings are doing less sales volume, which brings it down, because we're relatively new in those marketplaces. If you look at Canada, the expansion has been less. We've been entrenched a lot longer in just that Canadian market, in terms of the big markets in there, where we just open up buildings close by.
You open up another building anywhere from here to San Diego, and they start out very strong from day one. When you go into places like Fargo and Rochester, Minnesota, and East Peoria, Illinois, those buildings it just takes time to build because you don't have any membership base.
We don't open up a building in Canada where we don't already have a huge membership base nearby.
Austin: Interesting. Do you expect over time those numbers to maybe converge a little bit?
Jelinek: Absolutely. No question. No question.
Austin: What sort of different dynamics have you seen operating internationally? We know that many retailers when they try and go abroad it can be the kiss of death, because they try and apply the same strategies, with difficultly. Have you guys run into that?
Jelinek: Well, what you have to do is -- when we went international -- what you have to do is just be who you are, what got you there. We know the model that works. Now, you may sell a little bit different product line, but the packages are big.
One of the things that we've done is brought U.S.-type goods over there. You didn't see many people eat bagels in Japan when we went in there. We took the same bagel recipe that we have here and created it in Japan and it's one of our biggest items over there.
What makes us successful in these countries I think is because we're different than everybody else. Just like when we start in the U.S., we're just different than everybody else. In Canada we're just different than everybody else. Mexico, we're different. It's a unique type of business that there's not a lot of people that look the same and do business the same.
Whenever you're different and you can bring value, the consumer tends to like it.
Austin: Great. Just a follow-on to that; you look at a Wal-Mart going international, it's because they're running out of U.S. space. You look at a map of your company -- Seattle we might have 15 locations; Boston, we might have two or three over on the East Coast -- basically, what kind of upside do you think you still have in America? Could you see Costco doubling its presence from this point?
Jelinek: Over a period of time, I think that's very possible to do. I would think that we could ... you never know what's going to happen in the marketplace. You never know what's going to happen in the economy. You never know what kind of situations could happen in different countries.
But we feel very comfortable, over the next 15-20 years, we could double the size of the company. We think there's a lot of opportunities still left in the U.S.
Austin: That's just doubling domestically.
Jelinek: No. I would say domestically ... we could probably come close in 20 years.
Austin: A lot of the bigger retailers out there -- companies like Target and Wal-Mart -- are chasing customers into their ... the urbanization that we've seen, Target City has been popping up, seems to be pretty successful. Walmart's had some smaller locations as well that have exceeded their expectations for success.
As a big-footprint retailer, are you guys looking at a similar strategy? Would you consider moving to smaller formats to catch that urbanization trend?
Jelinek: If you look at, where we're not exactly in downtown Seattle, we're awful close. We're probably three miles from downtown, which works just fine for us. People will come to us and shop.
We want to continue to keep what we do simple. If you start to drift and become complicated, it costs you a lot of money to be complicated. Then what starts to happen? It costs you more goods, your cost of labor -- when I say "cost of labor," your SG&A starts to go up -- and then all of a sudden where you were under 10%, now you start getting up to 11%, 12%, which means you have to start raising your prices to get you there.
At the moment, I don't see us going there. We don't like to be on multi levels. Even in foreign countries, we have a few where we have two-story shopping, but we don't want that. We're doing everything to get to one-story shopping, no escalators for having to move customers up and down because, frankly, the escalators break down. They're very expensive to maintain.
What we want to do is, if property is hard to come by, we'll go one-floor sales and maybe have two or three floors of parking, but we want to try to keep everything very simple.
Austin: I've often wondered the dynamic of these multi-level stores. City Target we went in the other day is, just checking it out, it's three levels. What does the dynamic look like as far as customer behavior? Do people just not make it up to those second and third levels or is it merely just transporting carts that is a big difficulty?
Jelinek: I think they make it up there, but not as often. I think ... Transporting the carts is an issue but in our business particularly, we're very strong also in the food and sundries part of the business, so you have to go up there with a shopping basket because you're carrying meats and items like that.
I think in our business it's just more difficult to do. We'd just as soon stay away from it. We have found where we do have multi levels it's considerably more expensive over a year's time to run that business.
Austin: Especially with the huge pallets. I can imagine those just don't translate very well.
Jelinek: Not only ... they don't go by escalator, but you have to take those huge pallets down by storage elevators. There's a big expense to putting pallets in a storage elevator and going up and down.
Austin: Makes a lot of sense.
Jelinek: We've chosen to stay away from that as much as we can.
Austin: Seems like a good choice.
Analyst: Everyone has to be intrigued by China, just because it's such an opportunity. You guys haven't explored that yet. I think PriceSmart had actually licensed to China and pulled out within a year. What's your feel on the space? Have you guys looked at it and decided it's not an opportunity right now, or is it you're focusing enough on other opportunities like South Korea and Japan, it's just not on your horizon yet?
Jelinek: Well, we've got us a pretty good business going in Asia where we're at right now. There's lots of opportunities in the countries, in Japan, in Korea, in Taiwan. We're looking at France and Spain. We'll get that going.
You have to be careful. We've always been very conservative not to stretch the management so far where we can't run the business the way we choose to run it. I don't see us ...
China will always be there. China will be there 15 years from now, 10 years from now. At some point, we'll probably look at the opportunities in China. We've been over there, we've looked at it, but right now we think we've got enough in Asia going on right now with Taiwan, Korea, and Japan, and within the U.S. where we can do just fine if we're not in China.
Austin: There are a lot of retailers that have gone to China, certainly, with international experience and they've done very poorly over there. I know Best Buy has done very poorly, Wal-Mart's had a tough time. Why do you think it is that big, ordinarily successful retailers have a really tough time with China?
Jelinek: You know, I think that's a pretty good question. That's one reason that...
It's not fair for me to say, because I haven't spent a lot of time over there. I think when I go in there they all kind of look the same, so maybe you can't tell what's different about them, just because they're from the U.S.
But that's one of the reasons that... we're very successful in Korea, Japan, Taiwan, so we might as well go there. If we knew somebody that was really successful over in China, but we haven't seen that at the moment. More people seem to be cutting back than going in there, which, to me, that's kind of a red flag.
Austin: You talked about, in the U.S. if you go somewhere -- let's say Omaha -- the store is not going to make as much as one on the West Coast because you have to establish yourself there. There's always a cost.
China will always be there, but there's a cost to maybe being later and trying to build your presence there. How do you think about that trade-off, between executing and being able to take advantage of opportunities and be among the first to establish in a market before other companies go and open up warehouse concepts and build up their customer base?
Jelinek: The key is that there's got to be other companies that go in there and build there. Not many people have gone in and been successful in the warehouse business. At one time, there was probably eight different clubs. Now you're basically down to three. You've got BJ's, you've got Sam's, and you've got Costco.
I don't know that you're going to see anybody else jump in the business at the moment. When we feel that the time is ready, then we would go over there and compete, but right at the moment we don't see that being something that we have to do.
Austin: When you went to Japan and Korea before Europe, was that because you had seen more success within the warehouse space, or demographics? What made you go over there before...?
Jelinek: We just saw that Japan, when we went actually over to Japan and Taiwan, we saw a pretty good economy over there. Keep in mind, both of those markets started out very slow for us. Korea was very tough for us, but over time you just whittle away and good things start to happen as long as you continue to bring value in the marketplace and your consumer figures it out.
We don't do a lot of advertising. You have to sell memberships and they have to feel comfortable. It is a little intimidating, when you walk in there to a Costco and you see the big sizes and you start to ask yourself, "How is this going to work for me?"
They used to say you can't sell swing sets over in Japan because they don't have big homes. That's one of our biggest selling items, was a swing set. People figure these things out.
In terms of going in there, it takes time but you build your membership and once you start to get a reputation and a marketplace, and your reputation comes from doing the right thing and word of mouth for the consumer, good things will start to happen.
All those Asian countries, we're now very successful in.
