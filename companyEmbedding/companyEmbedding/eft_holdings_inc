FAQ










									 
 















                       
1. Q: What is EFT’s program?
A: EFT is an e-Commerce publicly traded company, and it was founded in 1998 (Business License Number 56-2310025). EFT has a tradition of identifying high value products including health care, anti-aging skin care, natural cosmetics, automotive, communications and traveling services. EFT‘s consumers are from more than 100 countries. All products are manufactured in the U.S.A, and sent directly to their house via EMS.
 
2. Q: Is EFT legal in China?
A: EFT is an American based company selling globally via the internet. Consumers in any country have the fundamental right to purchase goods from a foreign company. No monthly requirement，no inventory, no resale obligation, and it is completely legal.
 
3. Q: How to order EFT Company’s products?
A: Please fax the form including your name, address, sponsor’s ID (left or right) and the products you want to purchase to the U.S. Fax number: 001-626-581-0377 or 001-626-236-5730. Remittances should be in U.S. Dollars.
 
4. Q: How to use the ID number to view Web page and individual performance?
A: Add the first letter of your last name before your ID number. For example: Gao DaQuan, ID number is 200015, so the user name of access is G200015.
 
5. Q: How to use Email to place an order？
A: In order to ensure the timely and effective manner to place an order, EFT does not recommend the use of Email. If you have any questions, please email to: eft888@msn.com. Consumers should view personal information online every time with each order, and fax to the company immediately if you need to correct an error.
 
6. Q: If consumers sign up online, and make an error with their left or right placement, can they change by themselves?A: No.
 
7. Q: What is KSA?
A: KSA is an international organization and it certifies that the products for EFT are made under their strict rabbinical supervision and are certified Kosher and Pareve when bearing the KSA symbol of certification. The natural plant materials of EFT products are extracted from the European organic ingredients, easy to absorb, safe and very effective.
 
8. Q: How does the EFT bonus system avoid a meltdown?
The bonus is protected by the cap calculation; EFT can pay up to 70% of total sales on a weekly basis. Cap will be applied each week for the position earning over 30 cycles. After each ID position has earned $100,000; this position becomes retired. Bonuses are calculated by three stages, so that the bonus payments do not exceed 70%.

Welcome
 
    EFT was founded in 1998 by Mr. Jack Qin and   
    headquartered in City of Industry, California.  We  
     at  EFT strive to bring our affiliates the highest     quality   
products and one of the most 
    
enterprising affiliate pay-outs in the industry.
 
 
   
   Our time tested programs can help everyone; even affiliates who     

   
are new to the 
 industry.  Though most internet companies   
fail within 
 6 months   
   
to one  year, 
    
   

   EFT 
is an exception to this statistic and 
 has continued to grow as a dynamic e-Commerce 
   
company over 
 the past 15 years. 
 
   
Numerous lines of diversified products and a no risk philosophy in   
joining the EFT team, 
   ensures the continuation of  
 EFT’s success.
         

   
EFT  has 
 a tradition of identifying high value products and distribution networks .  
   Management has spent 
 years perfecting the exporting and importing products to many      

   
countries,  assuring a solid foundation 
 for global commerce.  From  
 the  26 bio-available 
   
nutritional and nutritional spray products to the 22 personal care, automotive   
and filtration 
   
products, EFT 
has identified “what we believe to be the best of the best in   
the world."
