Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]
Historic structures[edit]

In November 2004, CB&I was awarded a contract by one of the world's largest suppliers of wind turbines to fabricate 150 tubular steel support towers for wind turbines that were installed in wind farms in the western United States. The towers support 1.5-megawatt wind turbines, which are the largest wind turbines assembled in the United States and the most widely sold and tested megawatt-class wind turbines in the world.[citation needed] In April 2012, CB&I was awarded a contract for a petrochemicals expansion project in Geismar, Louisiana, including the license and basic engineering for the ethylene technology.[32]
In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

CB&I administrative headquarters






Chicago Bridge & Iron Works, 1912 catalog


Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., known commonly as CB&I, is a large conglomerate engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. CB&I specializes in projects for oil and gas companies. According to one of the founder's heirs, "The old joke is that Chicago Bridge & Iron isn't in Chicago, doesn't build bridges and doesn't use iron."[3] CB&I employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide.[4]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]
Historic structures[edit]
The company built bridges and other works that are on the National Register of Historic Places.[12] These works include (with varying attribution):

Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]

In November 2004, CB&I was awarded a contract by one of the world's largest suppliers of wind turbines to fabricate 150 tubular steel support towers for wind turbines that were installed in wind farms in the western United States. The towers support 1.5-megawatt wind turbines, which are the largest wind turbines assembled in the United States and the most widely sold and tested megawatt-class wind turbines in the world.[citation needed] In April 2012, CB&I was awarded a contract for a petrochemicals expansion project in Geismar, Louisiana, including the license and basic engineering for the ethylene technology.[32]
In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V. (CBI  -  Free Report)	 recently announced that it has clinched multiple technology contracts from chemical products manufacturer, Tianjin Bohua Chemical Development Co. Ltd., to build a grassroots petrochemicals plant in Tianjin, China. This is the company’s second major project in China in a week.Earlier, Chicago Bridge & Irons had inked a strategic alliance with Jinzhou Port Co., Ltd. (Jingang) which entails it to act as the master licensor for an integrated refining and petrochemicals project in Jinzhou City, China.For the current contract, the leading technology and infrastructure provider will offer license and engineering design to three units — an ethylbenzene unit, a methanol to olefins (MTO) light olefins recovery unit and a polypropylene unit. Chicago Bridge & Iron’s proprietary technologies, including the Novolen gas-phase polypropylene technology, will be used to produce a gamut of polypropylene products.A String of ContractsChicago Bridge & Iron managed to secure quite a few contracts in the last month of first-quarter 2017. These contracts are likely to provide the much needed boost to its waning top line and cash flow. The most notable among them, the $1.3 billion ethane cracker project secured from Total Petrochemicals & Refining USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Total S.A. (TOT  -  Free Report)	, was the fourth major one clinched by the company on the U.S. Gulf Coast.Apart from that, the company clinched a contract to offer five proprietary technologies in an integrated refining and petrochemical project in China. Also, the company gained a contract worth $460 million from NefteGazIndustriya, LLC, which requires it to provide services to the Afipsky Oil Refinery expansion project in Krasnodar, Russia. Chicago Bridge & Iron remains bullish about its robust technology portfolio and selective opportunities in key end markets in helping it boost profitability and market share.Besides China and the U.S., the company’s prospects in East Africa and the Middle East also look promising. For the U.S. and the Middle East, solid petrochemical investment on ethylene and low feedstock cost are projected to fuel growth. Investments in fossil power in the U.S. also bode well for the long-term growth of the company.Energy Woes Dim Near-Term ProspectsLike most other companies operating in the energy domain (particularly oil and gas sector), volatility in commodity pricing continues to be a major drag for Chicago Bridge & Iron’s profitability. Over the past few quarters, the company witnessed a precipitous decline in capital investments, severely marring its financials.On account of these uncertainties, the company slumped hard over the past one year, having declined 18.6% in stark contrast to the Zacks categorized Building-Heavy Construction industry’s average gain of 24.9%. Chicago Bridge & Iron’s disastrous run on the bourse continues in 2017 as well, with shares losing 4.2%, way wider than the industry’s average decline of 1.9%. The optimism around the stock post the unexpected victory of Donald Trump fizzled out soon.Also, the colossal miss in the recently reported fourth-quarter results, did not go well with investors. Overall, the company has a drab earnings surprise history with three misses in the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 13.9%. Moreover, the company holds no favor with analysts lately, as indicated by the downward revision of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company has seen six downward estimate revisions compared to none upward, over the past 30 days. This has led the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 to move down from $4.55 to $4.15, which indicates bearish analyst sentiment for the stock.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include Dycom Industries, Inc (DY  -  Free Report)	 and MasTec, Inc. (MTZ  -  Free Report)	. Both stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Dycom has a positive average earnings surprise of 17.30% for the last four quarters, having beaten estimates all through.MasTec has an average positive surprise of 54.4%, beating estimates each time over the trailing four quarters.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

Delaware Supreme Court




D67791


Jun 27 2017 (Date Decided)








                                      	Purchaser's challenge of seller's historical financials as not GAAP-compliant was not within scope of limited dispute resolution process in the parties' agreement, since process was merely limited to calculating difference in networking capital from signing to close, and where expanding scope of process would undermine contractual provision barring liability for representations and warranties regarding financials.

Chicago Bridge & Iron Works, 1912 catalog


Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., known commonly as CB&I, is a large conglomerate engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. CB&I specializes in projects for oil and gas companies. According to one of the founder's heirs, "The old joke is that Chicago Bridge & Iron isn't in Chicago, doesn't build bridges and doesn't use iron."[3] CB&I employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide.[4]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]
Historic structures[edit]
The company built bridges and other works that are on the National Register of Historic Places.[12] These works include (with varying attribution):

In late 2000, CB&I embarked on a series of acquisitions that have expanded its services to encompass the entire hydrocarbon industry, from conceptual design through technology licensing, engineering and construction, to final commissioning and technical services. CB&I acquired Lummus Global from ABB on November 19, 2007, adding approximately 3,000 employees to the CB&I payroll.[27][28] CB&I announced the acquisition of The Shaw Group in 2012, which added pipe, steel and module fabrication solutions as well as engineering and construction capabilities in the power generation industry that included fossil and nuclear construction. The transaction was completed on February 13, 2013.[citation needed] In 2015, CB&I announced that they are selling their Nuclear Construction division to Westinghouse Electric Company, a subsidiary of Toshiba, for $229 million.[29]
As of this date,[when?] CB&I's global business groups are:

The towers support 1.5-megawatt wind turbines, which are the largest wind turbines assembled in the United States and the most widely sold and tested megawatt-class wind turbines in the world.[citation needed] In April 2012, CB&I was awarded a contract for a petrochemicals expansion project in Geismar, Louisiana, including the license and basic engineering for the ethylene technology.[32]
In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]
Historic structures[edit]
The company built bridges and other works that are on the National Register of Historic Places.[12] These works include (with varying attribution):

In late 2000, CB&I embarked on a series of acquisitions that have expanded its services to encompass the entire hydrocarbon industry, from conceptual design through technology licensing, engineering and construction, to final commissioning and technical services. CB&I acquired Lummus Global from ABB on November 19, 2007, adding approximately 3,000 employees to the CB&I payroll.[27][28] CB&I announced the acquisition of The Shaw Group in 2012, which added pipe, steel and module fabrication solutions as well as engineering and construction capabilities in the power generation industry that included fossil and nuclear construction. The transaction was completed on February 13, 2013.[citation needed] In 2015, CB&I announced that they are selling their Nuclear Construction division to Westinghouse Electric Company, a subsidiary of Toshiba, for $229 million.[29]
As of this date,[when?] CB&I's global business groups are:


Technology, which offers licensed process technologies, catalysts, specialized equipment and engineered products for use in petrochemical facilities, oil refineries and gas processing plants;[citation needed]

In November 2004, CB&I was awarded a contract by one of the world's largest suppliers of wind turbines to fabricate 150 tubular steel support towers for wind turbines that were installed in wind farms in the western United States. The towers support 1.5-megawatt wind turbines, which are the largest wind turbines assembled in the United States and the most widely sold and tested megawatt-class wind turbines in the world.[citation needed] In April 2012, CB&I was awarded a contract for a petrochemicals expansion project in Geismar, Louisiana, including the license and basic engineering for the ethylene technology.[32]
In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

Chicago Bridge & Iron Company N.V., known commonly as CB&I, is a large conglomerate engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) company headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands. CB&I specializes in projects for oil and gas companies. According to one of the founder's heirs, "The old joke is that Chicago Bridge & Iron isn't in Chicago, doesn't build bridges and doesn't use iron."[3] CB&I employs approximately 40,000 people worldwide.[4]

History[edit]





This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (February 2017) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


Founding until World War II[edit]
CB&I was founded in 1889 in Chicago, Illinois, USA, as Chicago Bridge & Iron Company, when Horace E. Horton, a bridge designer, agreed to merge business with George and William Wheelock of the Kansas City Bridge and Iron Company.[citation needed] While initially involved in bridge design and construction, CB&I turned its focus to bulk liquid storage in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the western expansion of railroads across the United States and the discovery of oil in the Southwest.[citation needed] CB&I quickly became known for design engineering and field construction of elevated water storage tanks, above-ground tanks for storage of petroleum and refined products, refinery process vessels and other steel plate structures.[citation needed] As such, CB&I supported the expansion of oil exploration outside the US, starting operations in South America in 1924, in Asia two years later and in the Middle East in 1939.[citation needed]
During World War II, CB&I was selected to build Landing Ship Tanks (LSTs), which carried troops and supplies to American and Allied troops fighting in Europe and the Pacific theater.[citation needed] CB&I was chosen because of their reputation and skills, particularly welding.[citation needed] Since the coastal shipyards were busy building large vessels for the war effort, such as aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers and destroyers, there was no alternative but to use the inland waterways and shipyards for the production of smaller ships.[citation needed] As a result of these and other wartime production activities, CB&I ranked 92nd among US corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[5][verification needed]
CB&I has been involved in a number of changes during the past two decades. It was acquired by Praxair in 1996; Praxair kept a chemical subsidiary and spun off CB&I as a Dutch-incorporated company the next year.[3] CB&I headquarters moved from Chicago to Houston, Texas in 2001 and then to the Hague, Netherlands when Texas enacted a franchise tax.[citation needed]
Since 2000, it has acquired a number of companies. Most recently in 2012, CB&I agreed to buy The Shaw Group for about US$3 billion,[6][7][8] completing the acquisition in February 2013.[9]
The subsidiary that was formed as a result, CB&I Stone Webster—a result of The Shaw Group's earlier acquisition of Stone & Webster during its bankruptcy—was again sold, in January 2016, to Westinghouse Electric Co., for US$ 229M.[10]
Corporate headquarters and leadership[edit]
Corporate headquarters are located in The Hague, Netherlands. Administrative headquarters are located in Woodlands, Texas.[11]
Historic structures[edit]
The company built bridges and other works that are on the National Register of Historic Places.[12] These works include (with varying attribution):

In late 2000, CB&I embarked on a series of acquisitions that have expanded its services to encompass the entire hydrocarbon industry, from conceptual design through technology licensing, engineering and construction, to final commissioning and technical services. CB&I acquired Lummus Global from ABB on November 19, 2007, adding approximately 3,000 employees to the CB&I payroll.[27][28] CB&I announced the acquisition of The Shaw Group in 2012, which added pipe, steel and module fabrication solutions as well as engineering and construction capabilities in the power generation industry that included fossil and nuclear construction. The transaction was completed on February 13, 2013.[citation needed] In 2015, CB&I announced that they are selling their Nuclear Construction division to Westinghouse Electric Company, a subsidiary of Toshiba, for $229 million.[29]
As of this date,[when?] CB&I's global business groups are:


Technology, which offers licensed process technologies, catalysts, specialized equipment and engineered products for use in petrochemical facilities, oil refineries and gas processing plants;[citation needed]

In November 2004, CB&I was awarded a contract by one of the world's largest suppliers of wind turbines to fabricate 150 tubular steel support towers for wind turbines that were installed in wind farms in the western United States. The towers support 1.5-megawatt wind turbines, which are the largest wind turbines assembled in the United States and the most widely sold and tested megawatt-class wind turbines in the world.[citation needed] In April 2012, CB&I was awarded a contract for a petrochemicals expansion project in Geismar, Louisiana, including the license and basic engineering for the ethylene technology.[32]
In 2012, CB&I Technology (formerly Lummus Technology) was awarded a contract by Indian Petrochemicals major,[33] Reliance Industries to design to provide paraxylene (PX) technology for an aromatics complex in India. The complex is one of the largest of its kind, has capacity to make 2.2 MMTPA of Paraxylene. The complex was started up in April 2017.[34] With the start-up of this complex, Reliance is now the 2nd largest world producer of Paraxylene.[34]
Controversy[edit]
CB&I was revealed as a subscriber to the UK's Consulting Association, exposed in 2009 for operating an illegal construction industry blacklist; CB&I was one of 14 companies issued with enforcement notices by the UK Information Commissioner's Office.[35] A CB&I employee consulted the blacklist more than 900 times in 2007 alone, a 2010 employment tribunal was told.[36]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".

We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
