History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions.

DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
DST was founded in the 1960s as a subsidiary of Kansas City Southern Industries (KCSI) to track movements on their railroad. KCSI also owned a mutual fund management company and leveraged technology to automate the administration of mutual funds, creating the industry's first online shareholder accounting system.
To handle the growing processing and data storage demands seen in the 1980s, DST built several data centers, including one called Winchester that was built in 1985, which was one of the most sophisticated such centers in the United States at the time.
In the 1990s, DST was spun off as an independent entity from KCSI and began trading on the NYSE in 1995 as NYSE: DST.
In 1990, DST first released the Automated Work Distributor (AWD[3]), a business process management product that has been widely adopted by banks, insurance companies, healthcare companies, brokerages and mutual fund companies looking for a paperless environment.
In 1989, DST acquired a 50% interest in Argus Health Systems, at the time focused on pharmacy benefit administration. On March 31, 2009, DST acquired the remaining equity interest of Argus Health.
In 2005 and 2006, DST acquired CSC's Health Plan Solutions group and Amisys Synertech, Inc,[4] allowing DST to provide claims administration, software applications and business process outsourcing (BPO) solutions. This became the newly established DST Health Solutions, a sister company to Argus Health.
In 1991, DST created a wholly owned subsidiary eventually known as DST Customer Communications (formerly DST Output) to handle the design, printing, sorting, mailing and electronic presentment of the voluminous output of its product management systems.
In July 2016, DST sold their North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge Financial Solutions.
Expansion, Partnerships & Investments[edit]
Since 1973, DST has offered many services through substantial joint venture enterprises with State Street Corporation. DST and State Street joint venture activities now include significant international operations.
In 1992, DST formed International Financial Data Systems (IFDS), UK, as a joint venture with State Street Corporation. The UK venture later expanded to locations in Germany and Ireland to provide financial service recordkeeping services for its clients.
In 2001, IFDS combined with International Financial Data Systems (Canada) Ltd.
In 2008, Bluedoor Technologies, a provider of software solutions for participant accounting for the superannuation markets in Australia, was acquired.[13] DST Retirement Solutions was formally established that year.
In 2011, UK-based Lateral Group was acquired to create what is now called DST Applied Analytics. That same year, DST Brokerage Solutions and DST Market Services were established. Also acquired in 2011 was ALPS Holdings, Inc. (ALPS), a Denver-based provider of servicing and asset gathering solutions to the asset management industry. ALPS began in 1991 and became the first service providers of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) beginning in 1995. In 2007, ALPS expanded their capabilities to asset management, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies.
DST acquired New York-based kasina LLC in January 2015. kasina is a strategic advisory firm to the asset management industry and provides business analytics, consulting and research to asset managers. DST kasina is now part of DST Distribution Services.
In July 2015, DST acquired Wealth Management Systems Inc. (WMSI), a leading provider of technology-based rollover services in the retirement industry offering wealth management solutions. WMSI is now part of DST Retirement Solutions.
February 24, 2016, DST completed an acquisition of alternative fund service provider Kaufman Rossin Fund Services (KRFS).[5] KRFS is a full-service provider of specialized administration services to the global financial community and has expertise in the hedge fund business. KRFS is part of the asset servicing division of ALPS.
March 27, 2017, DST to acquire remaining interest in Joint Ventures, Boston Financial Data Services, Inc. (BFDS) and International Financial Data Services Limited ("IFDS U.K."), from State Street Corporation.[6]
May 7, 2017, DST Systems reports new $300 MLN share repurchase program.[7]

About Dst Systems, Inc.

Financial firms and health institutions focus on making clients
wealthy and healthy, respectively. So, they might be wise to turn
to DST Systems to handle their information processing tasks. The
company provides information processing software and services to
the mutual fund, insurance, retirement, and healthcare industries.
The company's financial services segment offers software and
systems used to handle a wide range of tasks including shareowner
recordkeeping, investment management, and business process
management. Among the healthcare offerings are claims adjudication
and benefit and care management. DST makes most of its sales to
customers in the US.
Operations
DST Systems' Financial Services business produces about
three-quarters of revenue. The segment supports direct and
intermediary sales of mutual funds, alternative investments,
securities brokerage accounts, and retirement plans. Its software
also handles reports to investors for confirmations, statements and
tax forms, web access, and electronic delivery of documents.
Systems include TA 2000 and TRAC. The company offers its AWD
workflow software to clients and licenses it to third parties.
The Healthcare Services segment, which provides medical and
pharmacy claims administration, generates about a fourth of sales.
The segment provides healthcare organizations with pharmacy and
healthcare administration software, and health outcomes
optimization services. Specific tasks handled by DST software
include claims adjudication, benefit management, care management,
and business intelligence.
DST operates its own data centers that provide secure
infrastructure for its products and services.
The company in 2016 divested its customer communications
segment, which had accounted for about half of sales.
Geographic Reach
The US is DST Systems' largest market, accounting for about 90%
of sales. The UK is its largest international market with about 5%
of sales. The company also has customers in Australia, Canada, and
several other geographic markets.
Sales and Marketing
DST Systems markets its products directly and through
subsidiaries, joint venture affiliates, and strategic alliances.
The Financial Services business works in some areas through joint
ventures with State Street Corp. In the US, the companies work
through Boston Financial Data Services and through International
Financial Data Services overseas.
DST's five largest customers overall account for more than 20%
of its operating revenues. The healthcare business is the more
heavily concentrated with its five largest customers generating
more than 50% of revenue, including nearly 20% from one customer.
Financial Services' five largest customers supply almost 30% of
operating revenue with the largest customer generating about
10%.
Primary customers for Financial Services are mutual funds and
fund managers. The main healthcare customers are managed care
organizations, preferred provider organizations, third-party
administrators, dental, vision, and behavioral health
organizations. The company also works with government sponsored
programs such as the Health Insurance Exchanges that operate under
the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare Advantage,
Medicare Part D, and Medicaid.


Financial Performance
While DST Systems' revenue increased incrementally for several
years, its profit slumped at the same time - until 2016.
The divestment of DST's North American Customer Communications
business had a considerable impact on the company's revenue. In
2015 revenue was $2.8 billion, which included the unit's sales.
Restated 2015 revenue, reflecting the absence of the unit's
revenue, was $1.5 billion.
In 2016, DST's revenue was $1.6 billion, about a 6% increase
from the restated $1.5 billion of 2015. It was a 45% drop from the
$2.8 billion figure.
Financial Services' operating revenue increased about 3% in 2016
from 2015. Businesses acquired in 2105 and 2016 contributed more
than $30 million revenue in operations and services associated with
the company's international wealth management business. Gains also
came from the conversion of about 10 million subaccounts associated
with a new client.
In Healthcare Services, revenue rose about 13% in 2016 from
additional medical claims processing clients, organic growth, and
the expansion of high-value services offered to existing
clients.
Net income rose about 20% to about $427 million in 2016 from
$358 million in 2015. The main difference was the gain on the sale
of the customer communications business.
Cash from operating activities was about $190 million in 2016,
compared to $220 million in 2015. The 2016 cash flow was affected
by cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities,
accrued compensation and benefits, and timing of tax payments.


Strategy
DST Systems is banking on its wealth and health businesses. The
company divested a big chunk of revenue in 2016 when it sold the
North American Customer Communications business to Broadridge
Financial Solutions Inc. for more than $400 million. For DST, the
unit, which provided print and digital communications, content
management, postal services, and fulfillment, didn't fit with its
focus on financial and healthcare services. DST followed that deal
with the 2017 sale of its UK Customer Communications business to
Paragon Group.
At the same time, DST has acquired companies that bolster its
focus areas, particularly Financial Services.
DST has significant exposure to federal healthcare systems in
the US. The company is taking a wait-and-see position on changes
that might be made by the federal government.
The company is working to make its internal workings more
efficient by a multi-year information technology transformation
initiative. Besides reducing operating costs, the new system is
intended to increase security, improve infrastructure, implement
automation, and allow use of emerging technologies as well as
improve performance of existing technologies. The company has spent
almost $400 million in 2014, 2015, and 2016 on software
development, maintenance, and enhancement.
Mergers and Acquisitions
DST Systems has been active on the acquisition front to
complement its product line and expand into new geographic areas.
DST has balanced its acquisition strategy by purchasing technology
providers and service providers, with an emphasis on business
process outsourcing concerns and consulting firms.
In 2016 DST bought Kaufman Rossin Fund Services , a provider of
administration services to the investment community, for $95
million. This acquisition provides DST with products for the
alternative investment market.
In 2015 DST acquired Wealth Management Systems, a provider of
retirement plan rollover technology, content, communications, and
practice management, for $64 million. DST sells Wealth Management
products through DST Retirement Solutions.
Also in 2015 DST's wholly-owned subsidiary ALPS bought Red Rocks
Capital, a private equity, for about $65 million. Red Rocks adds
expertise and experience in alternative investments to ALPS and
DST. ALPS and Red Rocks have had business engagements since
2007.
In a third 2015 deal DST acquired kasina, a strategic advisory
firm to the asset management industry. DST hopes to combine its
analytics and sales reporting tools with kasina's understanding of
challenges that face asset managers and insurers to uncover new
revenue opportunities for the financial industry.
