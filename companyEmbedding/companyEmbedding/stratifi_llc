The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Senior Researcher, Data Science










                    As a data scientist & senior researcher with 5+ years of experience, I love to tackle, formalize and solve challenges using rigorous statistical thinking and its fuel, the data. Through both my previous academic and industry positions, I gained experience in data cleaning and analyzes, pipeline creations, distributed computing and numerical modeling in the fields of high-energy physics, spatial and defense projects as well as finance. I have a particular interest in quantification of Risks/Uncertainties and detection of tiny signals using probabilistic thinking (Astrophysics taught me a lot about how to detect good, faint signal over fuzzy noise.) For ex. I built an end-to-end Bayesian Network tool to quantify uncertainties and anomalies of ocean depth measurement for a Defense project.
