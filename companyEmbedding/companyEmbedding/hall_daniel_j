Invictus





Series: Pavane Choral
														


Publisher: Pavane Publishing


Format: Octavo 



															TBB															
														


 
												  	    Composer: Daniel J. Hall


 


This product has a minimum order quantity of ten copies


 


														Selected for the Jo-Michael Scheibe series, this may be the most powerful song of encouragement for men's choir on the planet. The William Ernest Henley poem sets the stage, but it is the dynamic musical writing for both voice and piano that rock the house. Opening with a gentle chant establishes the theme, but the surprise hits as the keyboard assumes control. Superb choice for a dedication, graduation or concert program. Medium in difficulty.

Education, Training and Professional Experience
Born in Massachusetts and moving to Florida at a young age, Dr. Hall received his Bachelor of Science degree in Zoology from the University of Florida. While attending U.F., Dr. Hall fell in love with the area and decided he would eventually return one day.
After his undergraduate career, Dr. Hall went on to attend the School of Medicine at the University of Miami where he graduated with Research Distinction. This certainly wasn’t the end of Dr. Hall’s quest for knowledge and growth.
After graduating from U.M.’s School Medicine, Dr. Hall went on to complete a General Surgery internship and residency in head and neck surgery (otolaryngology) at Tripler Army Medical Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Dr. Hall was instrumental in developing a study program for the annual in-service exam for otolaryngology residents at Tripler, which led to the facility placing among the top 5 programs of its kind in the country.
It was also during this time that he developed interest and passion in facial plastic & reconstructive surgery, performing over 500 such procedures and easily placing him in the top percentile of all otolaryngology and plastic surgery residents.
After graduation, Dr. Hall was then selected for a fellowship in facial plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of California – Irvine where he broadened his experience in cosmetic and reconstructive procedures.
Returning to Tripler following his fellowship, Dr. Hall went on to become Chief of Facial Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery at one of the Army’s busiest hospitals. He also served as Team Leader for Cleft Lip & Palate/Craniofacial Surgery Team and was responsible for helping educate otolaryngology residents at the hospital.
After 5 years serving in this capacity at Tripler, Dr. Hall left the military in 2009 to move back to Gainesville, Florida and join Accent Physician Specialists.

Awards and Distinctions
During his 11 years as a surgeon in the U.S. Army, Dr. Hall received numerous awards and distinctions including:

Meritorious Service Medal
Army Commendation Medal
Joint Service Commendation Medal
Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal
3 Overseas Duty Ribbons
…and many more

Dr. Hall has also authored and published chapters for books in both print and online mediums as well as numerous medical journal articles and illustrations. He has lectured extensively around the world on cosmetic and reconstructive surgery at meetings ranging from local to international in scope.
In addition to these outstanding accomplishments, Dr. Hall is also a Fellow at the American College of Surgeons and is certified by the American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery.

Volunteer work
Besides his education and professional career, Dr. Hall has developed a strong passion for volunteering over the course of his life, first helping the homeless population at a student run health clinic in Miami.
Dr. Hall’s interest in volunteering and humanitarian work flourished during his time in the Army, becoming active in Operation Smile where he performed cleft lip, palate and other reconstructive surgeries in Morocco, China and Cambodia.
Dr. Hall also served as Surgical Team Leader for Operation T-Smiles and the Pacific World Care Program where he coordinated craniofacial reconstructive surgery for children in Southeast Asia. He also has served as an advisor to the World Healing Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping disadvantaged children with craniofacial disorders.

Other Specialties
While Dr. Hall’s specializes in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery of the face, he also maintains a practice in general head and neck (otolaryngology) surgery. His specific interests include sinus surgery and allergy treatment, including sublingual immunotherapy, as well as thyroid, parathyroid and head and neck surgery.
Dr. Hall strives to provide the most exceptional care in a compassionate way, no matter your condition. His deep commitment to cosmetic facial patients in the Gainesville area uniquely positions him to provide the best care available.
