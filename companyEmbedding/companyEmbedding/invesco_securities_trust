		*Since Inception performance is as of the first full month the fund was open. Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for the periods indicated. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  Gross performance has been calculated before the deduction of investment management and client service fees, but after the deduction of all other expenses applicable to the fund. Net Performance has been calculated after the deduction of the Annual Expense Ratio of the fund as well as a hypothetical management fee of 0.80%. Investment return and principal value will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares.


The FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index is an unmanaged index considered representative of global real estate companies and REITs. An investment cannot be made directly in an index.

 Investment Objective The investment objective of this collective trust fund is to achieve a higher than market return with average market risk over the long-term by investing in the universe of global real estate securities.   Investor Profile The Invesco Equity Global Real Estate Securities Trust may be appropriate for investors who seek total return from a combination of investment income and capital appreciation and wish to invest in global real estate securities. Investors should be comfortable with moderate to high risk and must be prepared to weather sudden and unpredictable variations in portfolio value associated with the risks of foreign investing. 
 Investment strategy Invesco maintains well-diversified portfolios with exposure to major sectors of the market. Our stock selection and fundamental research may lead us to overweight or underweight particular countries or property types. The focus for this portfolio is on larger, better quality companies that are expected to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns. In constructing the Fund's portfolio we compare current security valuation levels relative to valuation levels of alternative investments, the value of underlying real estate assets and other considerations such as a REIT management team's proven ability to add value throughout the investment cycle. 
 Fund management The trustee and investment manager. The trustee and investment manager for the Fund is Invesco Trust Company, a Texas trust company. 

 Fund sub-advisor The investment sub-adviser for the Fund is Invesco Advisers, Inc. Information concerning the sub-adviser can be found in its Form ADV filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available at www.sec.gov. Fund BenchmarkFTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Index 

Fund Fees and Expenses
Please refer to the Declaration of Trust and the Participation Agreement for information relating to minimum initial investments, fees and expenses payable in connection with an investment in the Fund. Fees and expenses charged by funds in which the Fund invests will be borne by the Fund. 



Investment Guidelines
Permitted Investments
The Fund will generally invest in public real estate equity securities that derive a substantial portion of their revenues from real estate industry activities and real estate fixed income securities including collateralized mortgage obligations, debt and preferred stock.

Under normal market conditions, the Fund may invest a maximum of 15% of the market value of the portfolio in securities that are not included in the stated Index.
The aggregate market value of a single issuer may not be more than 10% percent; provided however, if such security represents more than 7% of the weighting in the Index, then such security's weighting in the Fund may exceed the 10% limit, but shall not exceed the weighting in the Index plus 3%.
Under normal market conditions, the fund seeks to remain fully invested, but may hold cash equivalents (including repurchase agreements) pending investment of Fund assets in eligible securities and as deemed necessary by the Fund's portfolio manager in order to accommodate Fund withdrawals or in response to extraordinary market conditions.
The Fund may invest in, among other things, units of collective trust funds, including affiliated collective trust funds.
The Fund may buy or sell some or all of the following: forward currency contracts, futures contracts and options to attempt to hedge against the overall level of the investment and currency risk normally associated with each Fund's investments, to replicate cash investments and pursue investment strategies generally allowed under these guidelines.
 
The Fund may buy or sell some or all of the following: forward currency contracts, futures contracts and options to attempt to hedge against the overall level of the investment and currency risk normally associated with each Fund's investments, to replicate cash investments and pursue investment strategies generally allowed under these guidelines.
The Fund may only purchase a put option on an underlying security, contract or currency ("protective put") owned by the Fund in order to protect against an anticipated decline in the value of the security, contract, or currency.
The Fund will only enter into options and futures contracts that are traded on futures exchanges (either U.S. or non-U.S) and are standardized as to maturity date and the underlying financial instrument.
In no instance can derivatives be used in a manner inconsistent with the other constraints herein. That is, the use of derivatives must abide by all other constraints under these guidelines.


The Fund may engage in short sales of securities. The Fund will not sell a security short, if as a result of such short sale, the aggregate market value of all securities sold short exceeds 10% of the Fund's total assets.



Additional Information
Notice of each purchase and redemption order for this Fund must be received by Invesco Trust Company in good order no later than 4:00 p.m. EST on the trade date for such order, unless a written prior day trading agreement has been executed with Invesco Trust Company. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and the party delivering it shall be liable for any damages sustained by the Fund arising from such party's failure to make timely payment.

Investors and prospective investors in the Fund are strongly encouraged to review the complete terms of the Declaration of Trust for additional details regarding the Fund and its operation. Additional information regarding the Fund including performance, portfolio holdings and portfolio manager information can be found at www.invescotrustcompany.com.




Important Information
This product is a bank collective trust fund for which Invesco Trust Company serves as trustee and investment manager. The fund is not FDIC-insured or registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please see the fund's Declaration of Trust and recent financial statements (available upon request from your retirement plan sponsor) for important information before investing.

Material presented is compiled from sources believed to be reliable and current, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed. This does not constitute an offer or solicitation of any security or product, nor constitute a recommendation of the suitability of any investment strategy for a particular investor.

When evaluating whether a fund is appropriate for your investment goals, fund performance, fees and expenses are only a few of the criteria you should consider. You may also consider the investment objective, strategy and risks.





 Principal Risks of Investing
			 


The value of your investment in the Fund will go up and down with the prices of the securities in which the Fund invests directly and indirectly. Listed below are some of the principal risks associated with investing in the Fund.
General Investment Risk. Investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the Fund. Investors should not invest in the Fund unless they can readily bear the consequences of such loss.
Suitability Risk. Investors are expected to select investments whose investment strategies are consistent with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Market Risk. The prices of securities held by the Fund may go down due to general market and economic conditions.
Equity Securities Risk. Equity security prices change due to the earnings of the issuer, the value of its assets, economic conditions, interest rates, investor perceptions and market liquidity.
Real Estate Investment Risk. Because the Fund concentrates its assets in the real estate industry, an investment in the Fund will be closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets.
Industry Concentration Risk. The Fund will concentrate investment in a particular industry, so its share value may fluctuate in response to events affecting that industry.
Foreign Securities Risk. Non-U.S. securities have risks related to exchange rates, politics, economics, lack of information, low market liquidity and lack of strict financial controls.
Emerging Markets Risk. Emerging markets involve smaller sized, less liquid markets; unpredicatble inflation rates and political conditions; less stringent regulations; and lack of timely information.
Convertible Securities Risk. Convertible securities are affected by interest rates, the risk that the issuer may default, and the value of the common stock into which these securities may convert.
Derivatives Risk. For some derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount invested. If the Fund uses derivatives to ""hedge"" portfolio risk, the hedge may not succeed.
Leverage Risk. Leveraging magnifies changes, favorable or unfavorable, in the value of the portfolio's securities.
Interest Rate Risk. Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and rise as interest rates fall. Bond portfolios are riskier when interest rates rise. Long maturity bonds have more interest rate risk.
Short Sales Risk. Short selling subjects the Fund to losses if the security's price goes up before the short position is closed, or if the Fund borrowed securities and has to make the lender whole.
Liquidity Risk. When the Fund has difficulty in selling an asset quickly, it faces liquidity risk.
Currency Risk. The U.S. dollar value of the Fund's foreign investments will be affected by changes in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which investments are traded.
Securities Lending Risk. The Fund or the vehicles in which it invests may may participate in securities lending programs. The lending fund bears the risk of investment loss associated with any reinvestment of securities lending collateral held by the lending fund.
Increase in Expenses Risk. The actual cost of investing may be higher than the expenses listed in the expense table for a variety of reasons, including termination of a voluntary fee waiver or losing portfolio fee breakpoints if average net assets decrease. The risk of expenses increasing because of a decrease in average net assets is heightened when markets are volatile.
Not FDIC Insured Risk. The investment is not a deposit or obligation of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other U.S. governmental agency.
Accounts of Affiliates of the Investment Manager.   Affiliated managers may trade in securities at the same time as the Fund and, therefore, may potentially affect prices or available opportunities.
No Securities Registration. The Fund is exempt from registration with the SEC. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration with the SEC. Neither is registered with any state securities regulator.
No CFTC Registration.  The Fund is not registered as a commodity pool with the CFTC because the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator under CFTC Rule 4.5.

Investment objective
The Company's objective is to provide long-term capital growth by investing in a diversified portfolio of Asian and Australasian companies. The Company aims to achieve growth in its net asset value (NAV) in excess of the Benchmark Index, the MSCI All Countries Asia ex Japan Index (total return, in sterling terms).
Further details of the Company's Investment Policy and Risk and Investment Limits can be found in the Report of the Directors contained within the Company's Annual Financial Report.

Should you wish to contact a member of the Board of Directors, please do so via the Company Secretary (see Contact details).
Investment risks
The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be the result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested.
When making an investment in an investment trust you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares.
As this is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The investment trust may invest in derivatives. This means that the net asset value of the investment trust may, at times, be highly volatile. The use of derivative instruments involves certain risks (including market or communication breakdown, counterparty failure and credit risk) and there is no assurance that the objectives for the use of such instruments will be achieved.
The investment trust may use borrowings to invest in the market. The use of borrowings may enhance total return when the value of the investment trust's assets is rising, but it will have the opposite effect when asset values fall. The use of borrowings may increase the volatility of the share price and the net asset value per share. In certain circumstances, the investment trust may be required to repay borrowings and this could adversely affect income and capital returns.
Issued on behalf of the board of the Invesco Asia Trust plc by Invesco Fund Managers Limited.

Investment risks

      
      The value of investments and any income will fluctuate (this may partly be as a result of exchange rate fluctuations) and investors may not get back the full amount invested. Depending on individual circumstances, this may affect investment returns.  Past performance is not a guide to future returns. The market price of shares in investment trusts may not reflect their underlying net asset value.
As this is an emerging markets investment trust, investors should be prepared to accept a higher degree of risk than for an investment trust with a broader investment mandate as difficulties in dealing, settlement and custody problems could arise.
The ordinary shares are geared by way of an unsecured revolving credit facility. As a consequence, any reduction in the value of the trusts investments may lead to a correspondingly greater percentage reduction in its net asset value which would be likely to adversely affect the investment trust&apos;s share price.
      




Important information

      
      This information has been issued on behalf of the board of the investment trust and has been approved for issue by Invesco Asset Management Limited, its Manager and Company Secretary.
All portfolio figures are as at date shown (source: Invesco Perpetual).
75% of the annual management charge, and any performance-related fees which become payable and loan interest will be deducted from the investment trust&apos;s capital, which may boost income but constrain or erode long-term capital growth.
When making an investment in an investment trust you are buying shares in a company that is listed on a stock exchange. The price of the shares will be determined by supply and demand. Consequently, the share price of an investment trust may be higher or lower than the underlying net asset value of the investments in its portfolio and there can be no certainty that there will be liquidity in the shares.
The information on this page is selective and does not constitute an offer, or an invitation to subscribe for, or purchase, any securities. This page does not form part of any prospectus and application for shares should be considered only on the basis of a full prospectus.
Where Invesco Perpetual has expressed views and opinions, these may change. For detailed information on our investment trusts, please contact us.

		*Since Inception performance is as of the first full month the fund was open. Total return assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains for the periods indicated. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Gross performance has been calculated before the deduction of investment management and client service fees, but after the deduction of all other expenses applicable to the fund. Net Performance has been calculated after the deduction of the Annual Expense Ratio of the fund. Investment return and principal value will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell shares.
Amounts withdrawn may not be transferred to a competing option for 90 days after withdrawal.


The Barclays U.S. Treasury Bellwethers 3-Month Index is tracked by Barclays to provide performance for the three-month U.S. Treasury Bill. An investment cannot be made directly in an index.

Investment Objective
The primary investment objective of the Fund will be to seek the preservation of principal and to provide interest income reasonably obtained under prevailing market conditions and rates, consistent with seeking to maintain required liquidity.


Investor Profile
The Invesco Stable Value Trust may be appropriate for investors who seek little fluctuation in the value of their invested principal, a competitive interest rate, and a low level of overall risk.


Investment Strategy
The Fund's returns are based on returns generated by an actively managed, highly diversified portfolio of investment grade, fixed and floating rate securities. The Fund may invest in such securities directly or indirectly through commingled investment vehicles (the 'building block strategy'). This building block strategy may provide greater diversification than could be achieved by investing in individual bonds. This building block strategy also may reduce the unintended impact on portfolio characteristics created by participant cash flow.
The Sub-Advisor takes diversification a step further by retaining unaffiliated managers to manage a portion of the portfolio, whether directly or indirectly through commingled investment vehicles. The style diversification provided by unaffiliated managers may lead to improved consistency. The minimum average credit rating of the Fund's investments (or if such investments are interests in commingled investment vehicles, the underlying investments held by such vehicles) must be Aa3/AA- by Moody's/S&P or an equivalent as determined by another NRSRO (as defined below). Duration, maturity selection, spread volatility, sector and security selection are each potential sources of return.
In addition to the fixed income investments above, the Fund may enter into security investment contracts (sometimes called 'wrap agreements') issued by banks and insurance companies. These contracts are linked to the Fund's fixed income investments and are generally intended to allow for plan participant transactions to be effected at book value and the amortization of underlying fixed income gains and losses over a specified period of time through adjustments to the future contract interest crediting rate (which is the rate earned by investors in the Fund). The investment contracts provide that the adjustments to the interest crediting rate will not result in a future interest crediting rate that is less than zero. In general, if the contract value of the investment agreements exceeds the market value of the underlying investments (including accrued interest), the investment contract issuer becomes obligated to pay that difference to the Fund in the event that permitted plan participant redemptions result in a total contract liquidation. The circumstance under which payments are made and the timing of payments between the Fund and the contract issuer may vary based on the terms of the investment contracts, and the investment contract issuer's obligation to pay is subject to significant conditions relating to, among other things, the types and frequency of redemptions from or by the Fund.
The Fund may also invest in traditional guaranteed investment contracts or insurance company separate account contracts as defined in the investment guidelines.
Valuation and Reporting
The Fund's assets will be valued and reported in accordance with the Declaration of Trust and the provisions of and any amendments to ASC 825, Financial Instruments, ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, and ASC 946-210, Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts Held by Certain Investment Companies Subject to the AICPA Investment Company Guide and Defined Contributions Health and Welfare and Pension Plans (FSP AAG INV-1 and SOP 94-4-1), and other standards of financial accounting and reporting, if any, applicable to the Fund's investments.

Investment Guidelines
Permitted Investments
In general, the Fund's assets will consist of units of various high quality commingled fixed income investment funds that, when held inside investment contracts as described below, are intended to provide stable account values.
Investment Contracts
Investment contracts selected for the Fund are those that are acceptable to the Investment Manager considering creditworthiness, contract features, and administrative capabilities at the time of purchase. Investment contracts contain provisions that generally require the issuing institution to provide plan permitted liquidity from the Fund as needed at book value.

Security Investment Contracts
Approved security investment contracts may be purchased from insurance companies, banks, or other financial institutions. The investment performance of these contracts is typically related to a portfolio of investments held in custody accounts associated with the contracts. The acceptable assets held inside security investment contracts are described below under Acceptable Assets.
Traditional Investment Contracts
Approved traditional investment contracts may be purchased from insurance companies, banks or other financial institutions. A traditional investment contract is a direct obligation backed by the creditworthiness of the issuing entity.
Separate Account Contracts
Approved separate account contracts may be purchased from insurance companies. The investment performance of these contracts is typically related to a portfolio of investments held inside the related separate accounts. The assets are held in a separate account of the issuer and are protected from other creditors of the issuer. The acceptable assets held in separate account contracts are described below under Acceptable Assets.

Acceptable Assets
Acceptable assets that may be held inside investment contracts are publicly or privately issued fixed, floating or variable rate obligations of the following issuers (held either directly or indirectly through affiliated or unaffiliated commingled investment vehicles):

U.S Treasury Notes and Bonds
U.S. Agency or Government-Sponsored Entity (GSE) Notes and Bonds.

Non-corporates: Sovereign; Supranationals; Foreign Agencies; and Foreign Local Governments (including Yankee bonds).
Municipal securities.

Repurchase Agreement. The maximum term of these agreements will be 60 days, and the collateral must be marked-to-market daily.
Interest rate futures, options and interest rate swaps.

Interest rate futures, options and swaps may be used to manage yield curve or duration or other risk positions. Derivatives must abide by the duration, credit quality, and all other constraints under these guidelines. Purchases and sales may be transacted for regular or deferred/forward settlement.
Investment Constraints
Credit and Diversification

Traditional investment contract issuers must, at the time of purchase, be rated at least A- by Moody's, S&P, or other Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (NRSRO) and approved by the Investment Manager. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a traditional investment contract issuer shall not exceed 5% at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested in traditional investment contracts shall not exceed 25% at the time of purchase.
Separate account contract issuers must be approved by the Investment Manager at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a separate account contract issuer shall not exceed 33% at the time of purchase.
Security investment contract issuers must be approved by the Investment Manager at the time of purchase. The maximum percentage of the Fund invested with a security investment contract issuer shall not exceed 33% at the time of purchase.
The minimum credit rating of the Fund's investments must be investment grade (BBB-/Baa3) or equivalent by another NRSRO. Split rated securities are permitted provided that at least one rating is of investment grade. For all ratings, the higher rating applies. A security no longer meeting this minimum must be sold within 6 months, unless an exemption is granted by the Investment Manager.
The minimum average credit rating of the Fund's investments must be Aa3/AA- by Moody's, S&P, or another NRSRO.

Duration
The Fund shall normally be managed with a weighted average duration of not less than one and one half years and not more than four years. Short-term investments must be included in the calculation of the Fund's duration. While a range of two to four years is preferred, the Fund will be managed opportunistically, consistent with the investment objectives set forth above.
Other Constraints
The Investment Manager may hold short-term investments or other fixed income vehicles allowing ready access to cash for plan participant liquidity needs, such as plan participant withdrawal and transfer requests.


Additional Information

Each such notice shall be irrevocable and the party delivering it shall be liable for any damages sustained by the Fund arising from such party's failure to make timely payment.

Investors and prospective investors in the Fund are strongly encouraged to review the complete terms of the Declaration of Trust for additional details regarding the Fund and its operation.

 Principal Risks of Investing
			 


The Fund is designed to preserve principal investment and provide a competitive level of interest income. However, when investing in a the Fund, you should consider the following risks:
General Investment Risk - Investors could lose all or a portion of their investment in the Fund. Investors should not invest in the Fund unless they can readily bear the consequences of such loss.
Suitability Risk - Investors are expected to select investments whose investment strategies are consistent with their financial goals and risk tolerance.
Wrap Contract Risk - default by a wrap issuer; costs reduce Fund performance; new wraps have less favorable terms or higher costs; poor Fund performance may lead to constrained Fund investments, reducing Fund performance; small number of wrap issuers concentrates exposure; termination of a wrap could result in loss of book value coverage.
Crediting Rate Risk - The Fund's credited rate will generally lag market interest rates. Wrap contract crediting rates may go down if a large number of participants request redemptions from the Fund.
Market Risk - The prices of securities held by the Fund may go down due to general market and economic conditions.
Inflation Risk - The Fund's principal investment may not maintain the same purchasing power in the future if inflation rises.
Leverage Risk - Leveraging magnifies changes, favorable or unfavorable, in the value of the portfolio's securities.
Interest Rate Risk - Bond prices fall as interest rates rise, and rise as interest rates fall. Bond portfolios are riskier when interest rates rise. Long maturity bonds have more interest rate risk.
Yield Curve Risk - Yield curve risk refers to the risk that the Fund will be adversely impacted by changes in the differences between interest rates on shorter term and longer term debt instruments.
Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk of an issuer's financial health deterioriating, which may result in a credit rating downgrade and the issuer's inability to make timely bond payments.
Spread Risk - Spread risk is the risk that changes in the difference between the yields of debt instruments (whether due to credit quality or otherwise) could adversely affect the Fund.
Liquidity Risk - When the Fund has difficulty in selling an asset quickly, it faces liquidity risk.
Call Risk - If a callable bond is redeemed before maturity, the Fund may be forced to reinvest the principal at a lower interest rate.
Prepayment Risk - Homeowners may pay off their mortgages early. This forces the Fund to reinvest the principal sooner than expected, which could be at a lower interest rate.
Derivatives Risk - For some derivatives, the Fund could lose more than the amount invested. If the Fund uses derivatives to "hedge" portfolio risk, the hedge may not succeed.
Active Trading Risk - The Fund may engage in frequent trading to achieve its investment objective. If the Fund does trade frequently, it may incur increased costs, which can lower the Fund's return.
Management Risk - The investment techniques and risk analyses used by the Fund's portfolio managers may not produce the desired results.
Securities Lending Risk - The Fund or the vehicles in which it invests may may participate in securities lending programs. The lending fund bears the risk of investment loss associated with any reinvestment of securities lending collateral held by the lending fund.
Risks Associated with Investing in an Investment Vehicle  - The Fund may itself invest in an investment vehicle, such as a private investment or commingled fund. When it does so, the investing fund is subject to the underlying risk of that investment vehicle's portfolio securities.
Increase in Expenses Risk - The actual cost of investing may be higher than the expenses listed in the expense table for a variety of reasons, including termination of a voluntary fee waiver or losing portfolio fee breakpoints if average net assets decrease. The risk of expenses increasing because of a decrease in average net assets is heightened when markets are volatile.
Not FDIC Insured Risk - The investment is not a deposit or obligation of, or guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank and is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, or any other U.S. governmental agency.
Accounts of Affiliates of the Investment Manager - Affiliated managers may trade in securities at the same time as the Fund and, therefore, may potentially affect prices or available opportunities.
No Securities Registration - The Fund is exempt from registration with the SEC. Units of the Fund are exempt from registration with the SEC. Neither is registered with any state securities regulator.
No CFTC Registration - The Fund is not registered as a commodity pool with the CFTC because the Trustee is exempt from having to register as a commodity pool operator under CFTC Rule 4.5.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies domiciled in both the United Kingdom and Canada. As a result, political or economic developments in either the United Kingdom or Canada may have a significant impact on the securities included in the Portfolio.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.

The performance data quoted for the individual series of a trust that has not terminated or has an open termination date is from the deposit date through the current date quoted. For individual series that have terminated, performance data quoted is from the deposit date through the termination date.Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.
A trust's performance, especially for short time periods, should not be the sole factor in making your investment decision. Please keep in mind that high, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should also be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.
Returns With Sales Charge reflect the maximum sales charge that would be payable by an investor upon sale or redemption of units at the end of the applicable period(s). The sales charge includes any initial or deferred sales charges other than creation and development fee. These returns do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment. by a trust. These returns reflect any contingent deferred sales charges only if the charges would be payable upon a unit sale or redemption at or prior to the end of the applicable performance period(s). Certain trusts are no longer offered for sale to the public and, as a result, do not publish an offer price or have a sales charge. In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
Returns Without Sales Charge do not reflect any sales charge and do not reflect any creation and development fee prior to collection (generally the close of the initial offering period). Any creation and development fee is reflected in the returns as of the time of payment by a trust.

Certain trusts are passively managed and seek to track their target index during the trust's life. For a more complete discussion of the risks of investing in this trust, click on the Fact Card.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.

There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
The Portfolio is concentrated in the consumer discretionary and consumer staples sectors. Companies that manufacture, distribute and provide consumer products and services face risks such as intense competition, the lack of serious barriers to entry for online entrants, economic recession and a slowdown in consumer spending trends.
The Portfolio is concentrated in securities issued by companies domiciled in both the United Kingdom and Canada. As a result, political or economic developments in either the United Kingdom or Canada may have a significant impact on the securities included in the Portfolio.
Value, blend and growth are types of investment styles. Growth investing generally seeks stocks that offer the potential for greater-than-average earnings growth, and may entail greater risk than value or blend investing. Value investing generally seeks stocks that may be sound investments but are temporarily out of favor in the marketplace, and may entail less risk than growth investing. A blend investment combines the two styles.

During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

 Risk & Other Information 
 
Typically, security classifications used in calculating allocation tables are as of the last trading day of the previous month.  There are risks involved with investing in ETFs, including possible loss of money. Shares are not actively managed and are subject to risks similar to those of stocks, including those regarding short selling and margin maintenance requirements. Ordinary brokerage commissions apply. The Fund's return may not match the return of the Underlying Index. The Fund is subject to certain other risks. Please see the current prospectus for more information regarding the risk associated with an investment in the Fund. Investments focused in a particular industry or sector, such as clean energy and energy, are subject to greater risk, and are more greatly impacted by market volatility, than more diversified investments. The risks of investing in securities of foreign issuers, including emerging market issuers, can include fluctuations in foreign currencies, political and economic instability, and foreign taxation issues. Stocks of small and mid-sized companies tend to be more vulnerable to adverse developments, may be more volatile, and may be illiquid or restricted as to resale.

Preferred Opportunity Portfolio (PFOP0173)
	
	




Objective
The Portfolio seeks an attractive level of current income. The Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective by investing in a portfolio consisting of preferred securities issued primarily by financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies.




Why Consider Investing in the Preferred Opportunity Portfolio?

Potential Monthly IncomeUnlike some individual preferred securities, which pay income quarterly, this Portfolio is structured to pay monthly income, if any, offering investors a potential regular stream of current income. 
ConveniencePreferred securities can be difficult for an individual investor to analyze and select because of their unique structure. This Portfolio offers the convenience of a professionally selected portfolio of preferred securities. 
DiversificationBecause the Portfolio invests in a variety of preferred securities in several different industry sectors and with different credit quality, investors may gain an added level of portfolio diversification. 
Qualified Dividend Income1Qualifying dividends are currently taxed at a federal rate from zero to 20% depending on the tax bracket of the investor.  A significant portion of the Portfolio includes preferred securities that pay dividends that qualify for this qualified dividend income treatment.

Invesco does not provide tax advice. The tax information contained herein is general and is not exhaustive by nature and was designed to promote the marketing of units. It was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer under U.S. federal tax laws. Federal and state tax laws are complex and constantly changing. You should always consult your own legal or tax advisor for information concerning your individual situation.
1 There is no assurance that income distributions from the portfolio will be qualified dividends for federal tax purposes. In addition, certain holding period requirements must be satisfied for investors to be eligible to take advantage of the lower tax rate on qualified dividend income and there is no tax advantage to investors who hold units in retirement accounts. Under the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, income from the Portfolio may also be subject to an additional 3.8% tax for investors exceeding certain income thresholds. Invesco and its employees do not provide tax advice. You should consult your personal tax advisor before making any tax related investment decision.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or eliminate the risk of loss.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust’s life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
An investment in the trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated with an investment in a Portfolio of preferred securities, such as the inability of the issuer to pay the principal of or income on a security when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the securities.
The value of preferred securities may fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on preferred income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
An issuer may be unable to make dividend or interest payments in the future. This may result in a reduction in the value of your Units.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio will receive early returns of principal if securities are called or sold before the Portfolio termination. If this happens your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. In addition, the value of your units may decline if any Portfolio securities trading at a premium are called at par.
Certain preferred securities in the Portfolio are rated below investment grade and considered to be "junk" or "high-yield" securities. Securities rated below "BBB-" by Standard and Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's are considered to be below investment grade. These securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than with investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal.
The Portfolio invests solely in preferred and debt securities. Preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore are subject to greater risk than those debt instruments. In addition to the other risks described herein, income payments on most preferreds are noncumulative and can be deferred indefinitely; distributions on certain hybrid-trust preferreds may be skipped or deferred. This deferred risk may reduce the amount of income you receive on your Units.
The Portfolio is concentrated in banks and other companies in the financial services industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financial services sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
Securities of foreign companies held by the funds in the Portfolio present risks beyond those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

The negative impact on preferred income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
An issuer may be unable to make dividend or interest payments in the future. This may result in a reduction in the value of your Units.
The financial condition of an issuer may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the Portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The Portfolio will receive early returns of principal if securities are called or sold before the Portfolio termination. If this happens your income will decline and you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive at as high a yield. In addition, the value of your units may decline if any Portfolio securities trading at a premium are called at par.
Certain preferred securities in the Portfolio are rated below investment grade and considered to be "junk" or "high-yield" securities. Securities rated below "BBB-" by Standard and Poor's or below "Baa3" by Moody's are considered to be below investment grade. These securities are considered to be speculative and are subject to greater market and credit risks. Accordingly, the risk of default is higher than with investment grade securities. In addition, these securities may be more sensitive to interest rate changes and may be more likely to make early returns of principal.
The Portfolio invests solely in preferred and debt securities. Preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore are subject to greater risk than those debt instruments. In addition to the other risks described herein, income payments on most preferreds are noncumulative and can be deferred indefinitely; distributions on certain hybrid-trust preferreds may be skipped or deferred. This deferred risk may reduce the amount of income you receive on your Units.
The Portfolio is concentrated in banks and other companies in the financial services industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financial services sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
Securities of foreign companies held by the funds in the Portfolio present risks beyond those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

The Portfolio invests solely in preferred and debt securities. Preferred securities are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore are subject to greater risk than those debt instruments. In addition to the other risks described herein, income payments on most preferreds are noncumulative and can be deferred indefinitely; distributions on certain hybrid-trust preferreds may be skipped or deferred. This deferred risk may reduce the amount of income you receive on your Units.
The Portfolio is concentrated in banks and other companies in the financial services industry and may present more risk than a more diversified investment. There are certain risks specific to the financial services sector, including the potential adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates, and state and federal regulations.
Securities of foreign companies held by the funds in the Portfolio present risks beyond those of U.S. issuers. These risks may include company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

Each Key Stat shows the weighted average of a particular metric attributable to the underlying securities included in the portfolio of the trust, and does not represent a statistic of the trust itself.



1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.


The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance the trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit investment trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged and its portfolio is not intended to change during the trust's life except in limited circumstances. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust. The trust should be considered as part of a long-term investment strategy and you should consider your ability to pursue it by investing in successive trusts, if available. You will realize tax consequences associated with investing from one series to the next.
You could experience dilution of your investment if the size of the portfolio is increased as Units are sold. There is no assurance that your investment will maintain its proportionate share in the Portfolio's profits and losses.
The financial condition of an issuer of Securities held by the Trust may worsen or its credit ratings may drop, resulting in a reduction in the value of your Units. This may occur at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.
The Trust is concentrated in securities issued by companies in the financials, health care, consumer discretionary, consumer staples and industrials. Negative developments in these industries will affect the value of your investment more than would be the case in a more diversified investment.
Common stocks do not assure dividend payments. Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer’s board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time. There can be no guarantee or assurance that companies will declare dividends in the future or that if declared, they will remain at current levels or increase over time.
The Trust may be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than the broader market. The Trust invests significantly in securities issued by financials companies and utilities companies, and, as a result of their potentially higher dividend yield relative to the broader market, the trust may exhibit greater sensitivity to movements in interest rates than the broader market. 
Investing in foreign securities involves certain risks not typically associated with investing solely in the United States. This may magnify volatility due to changes in foreign exchange rates, the political and economic uncertainties in foreign countries, and the potential lack of liquidity, government supervision and regulation.
Central Equity Trust securities are offered by Edward Jones. As described more fully in the prospectus, Edward Jones may have received compensation in other capacities from, or have other relationships with, the issuers of the common stocks held by a Trust. The opinions expressed may change at anytime.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.

1The Portfolio will make distributions of income and capital on each specified Distribution Date to unitholders of record on the preceding Record Date, provided that the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus. Undistributed income and capital will be distributed on the next Distribution Date in which the total cash held for distribution meets or exceeds any applicable minimum that may be specified in the prospectus.  The Estimated Annual Income per Unit is as of the date listed in the prospectus during the trust's initial offering period, and is updated each calendar quarter thereafter. This amount is based on the most recently declared dividends or interim and final dividends accounting for any foreign withholding taxes, but may also be based upon several recently declared dividends. The actual net annual distributions you receive will vary from the estimate set forth above with changes in the trust's fees and expenses, in dividends and distributions received, currency fluctuations and with the sale of trust securities. The actual net annual distributions are expected to decrease over time because a portion of the securities included in the trust will be sold over time to pay for organization costs. Securities may also be sold to pay regular fees and expenses during the trust's life.  The Portfolio may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes to the extent of the Unitholder's basis in the Units, and any additional amounts in excess of basis would be taxed as a capital gain. Generally, you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your Units. Unitholders should consult with their individual tax advisors.
2As of the close of business day prior to Initial Date of Deposit. The actual distributions you may receive will vary from the estimated amount due to changes in the Portfolio's fees and expenses, in actual income received by the Portfolio, currency fluctuations and with changes in the Portfolio such as acquisition or liquidation of securities.
3The estimated annual expenses are based upon the estimated trust size for the Portfolio determined as of the initial date of deposit. Because certain of the operating expenses are fixed amounts, if the trust does not reach that estimated size, the amount of the estimated annual expenses per unit may exceed the amounts reflected. On the business day following the end of the initial offering period, the Sponsor and/or the Supervisor will waive their respective fees, and/or the Sponsor will reimburse the Portfolio operating expenses, in an amount so that the total estimated annual expenses calculated on that date do not exceed $0.0350 per unit.However, subsequent to that date the value of the Portfolio as well as the number of outstanding units may decline, and/or the actual amount of the operating expenses may exceed the estimated amounts, any of which could result in the actual amount of the total annual expenses exceeding $0.0350 per unit.
