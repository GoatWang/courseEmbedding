Rangeford Resources, Inc.
Rangeford Resources, Inc. is purchasing proved producing oil and gas leasehold and wells in the Mid Continent region, where historic fields hold verifiable recoverable hydrocarbon in predictable amounts and timetables.
 The corporation makes such acquisitions without incurring debt or major costs based upon the use of carried interests or equity trades. The company has entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to hold a balanced portfolio of owned and optioned oil and gas, and has a very low LOE and overhead rate. The company will undertake no project which creates the need for long term debt, nor the potential for major increases in overhead. In all cases, reserves remaining, and capex costs for the recovery of those reserves, are low risk in nature, and well known.
Currently, all field operations are accomplished using a long term, exclusive contracted source  for the field aspects of land, legal, drilling, completions and production supervision. The corporation is able to operate in several states without the need to acquire new employee base or extending costs and overhead, as the use of these services is on an on call, as needed basis only. Projects acquired by Rangeford Resources, Inc. are fully investigated, post due diligence and curative periods, and ready to produce revenue to the company day one following closing.
RRI undertakes a limited amount of drilling and completions in deeper horizons or horizontal areas. The company does not participate in shale or unconventional reservoir development or acquisitions. Most drilling and completions are above 7000 feet in depth, and there are no current secondary recovery properties in the inventory. The company utilizes the recompilation of older wells to enhance field performance in predictable behind pipe or recompletion of known reserves from original completion zones. LOE is typically less than 22% of gross revenue per barrel or MMCF. Some oil and gas sales bring premium pricing over WTI or Henry Hub gas prices at this time.

				Strategic Plan			











 Goal: Maximizing proved reserves while minimizing costs.


Balance oil and gas reserves in known U.S. onshore producing regions with low operating costs and minimal finding and development risk.                                            
Avoid speculative resource plays and high risk exploration in favor of known, proven hydrocarbon resources where risk and volumes are fully understood in advance of investment.                                                                                               
Establish a combined residual rework program and new drill wells incorporating new technologies to maximize reserve recovery and cash flow.                                           
Focus investments in recognized oil and natural gas regions with emphasis on Kansas and Wyoming.



Operating Regions
Kansas and Wyoming. Other areas will be considered on an opportunity-by-opportunity basis. Corporate operating agreements are in place in the listed states, and Rangeford will likely stay within these geographic areas of the U.S. Evaluation of opportunity does not end with geology and engineering. There must be a clear pathway to functional and profitable monthly revenues from efficient operations in the field. Surface and weather conditions, an eye to keeping operations “green” and environmentally sound and other criteria are always considered in Rangeford’s operations.
