Separate Account

What is a 'Separate Account'
A separate account is a privately managed investment account opened through a brokerage or financial advisor that uses pooled money to buy individual assets. 2. In the context of variable annuities, these are payments made to an insurance company for the purpose of investing in securities. These securities are kept separate from the insurer's general investments. 

BREAKING DOWN 'Separate Account'
1. This differs from a mutual fund because the investor directly owns the securities instead of owning a share in a pool of securities. Most separate accounts require a minimum investment of $100,000 or more.

The Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information, Supplements and Exhibits for the Transamerica Landmark Variable
Annuity of the Separate Account VA B are hereby incorporated by reference to the Form N-4 Registration Statement (33-33085 and 811-06032) filed on April 27, 2005. 


TRANSAMERICA LANDMARK VARIABLE ANNUITY    Issued by    TRANSAMERICA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY    Supplement dated             , 2005  to the  Prospectus dated May 1, 2005
   5 FOR LIFE WITH GROWTH RIDER    You may elect to purchase the optional 5 for Life with Growth rider which provides you with
a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit. This rider is available during the accumulation phase but it will not be issued if the annuitant is younger than 60 or older than 80. The maximum issue age may be lower if required by state law. 
  The 5 for Life with Growth rider may vary for certain policies and may not be available
for all policies. Please contact Transamerica at (800) 525-6205 for additional information regarding the availability of the 5 for Life with Growth rider.    This supplement hereby amends, and to the extent inconsistent replaces, the prospectus disclosure.    Fee Table   






Optional Rider Fees:
  
 

 5 for Life with Growth Rider (with additional death benefit)(1)
  
  .    %

 5 for Life with Growth Rider (without additional death benefit)(1)
  
  .    %



(1)
The fee is a percentage of the total withdrawal base.    5 for Life with Growth Benefit    This benefit is intended to provide an accumulating withdrawal base during the growth period and then provide a level of cash withdrawals regardless of the performance of
the variable investment options you select. If you elect this benefit, we will provide a maximum annual withdrawal amount regardless of your policy value while the annuitant is living (your ability to change the frequency or amount of your
withdrawal ceases if your policy value reaches zero). Under this benefit, you can withdraw up to 5% of the total withdrawal base each calendar year that the annuitant is living (unless your total withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of
“excess” withdrawals; see “Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments”, below).    This Prospectus Supplement must be accompanied or preceded  by the Prospectus for the
 Transamerica Landmark Variable Annuity dated May 1, 2005 


Example. Assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of $100,000 when you are 61
years old. Further assume that you do not make any additional withdrawals or premium payments, but that after five years your policy value has declined to $70,000 solely because of negative investment performance. At that time, you could still
withdraw up to $6,381each calendar year for the rest of your life (assuming that you do not withdraw more than $6,381 in any one year.)    Of course, you can always withdraw an amount up to your cash value pursuant to your rights under the policy at your discretion. Please note, the amount of your
gross partial withdrawal may impact the maximum annual withdrawal amount, total withdrawal base, and minimum remaining withdrawal amount and such impact may be on a greater than dollar-for-dollar basis.    Like all withdrawals, withdrawals under this benefit also:   


•
 
reduce your policy value;   


•
 
reduce your base policy death benefit and other benefits;   


•
 
may be subject to surrender charges and excess interest adjustments;   


•
 
may be subject to income taxes and federal tax penalties; and   


•
 
may be limited or restricted under certain qualified policies.    Rider Issue Requirements. The Company will not issue the 5 for Life with Growth rider unless:   


•
 
the annuitant is at least 60 and not yet age 81;   


•
 
the annuitant is also an owner (except in the case of non-natural owners); and   


•
 
there are no more than two owners.    Maximum Annual Withdrawal Amount. You can withdraw up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount in any calendar year without causing an excess withdrawal. See Total
Withdrawal Base Adjustments and Minimum Remaining Withdrawal Adjustments below.   


•
 
The maximum annual withdrawal amount in the year the rider is elected is equal to 5% of the total withdrawal base prorated based on the number of days from the rider date to the end
of the calendar year. Thereafter, the maximum annual withdrawal amount for each calendar year is equal to 5% of the total withdrawal base.   


•
 
Please note, the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above is based on calendar years, not rider or policy years.    For qualified policies:    If the annuitant is at least 70 ½ years old, the maximum annual withdrawal amount for that calendar year (and each subsequent calendar
year) is equal to the greater of:   


•
 
the maximum annual withdrawal amount described above; or   


•
 
an amount equal to a minimum required distribution amount calculated using only: (1) the living annuitant’s age, (2) the IRS Uniform Lifetime table or, if applicable, the Joint
Life and Survivor Expectancy table, (3) the policy value of the base policy, (including the present value of any additional benefits provided under the policy to the extent required to be taken into account under IRS guidance) and (4) amounts from
the current calendar year (no carry-over from past years). An amount not calculated as set forth above cannot be used as the maximum annual withdrawal amount.   
2 


You can take withdrawals under this rider regardless of your policy value; however, once your policy value reaches zero
you cannot make premium payments and all other policy features, benefits, and guarantees (except those provided by this rider) are terminated. In order to continue withdrawals guaranteed by this rider after your policy value reaches zero, you must
select the frequency of future withdrawals. Once selected, the amount and frequency of future withdrawals after your policy value reaches zero cannot be changed.    Growth Period. The growth period begins on the rider date and ends at the earlier of the first withdrawal or the tenth rider
anniversary.    Total Withdrawal Base. We use the total withdrawal base to
calculate the maximum annual withdrawal amount. The total withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value (less any premium enhancement, if the rider is added in the first policy year).    The total withdrawal base during the growth period is equal to:   


•
 
the total withdrawal base on the rider date; plus   


•
 
premiums added during the growth period;   


•
 
accumulated at an annual effective rate of             %(the accumulation stops at the end of the growth period).
   The total withdrawal base after the growth period is equal to:
  


•
 
the total withdrawal base at the end of the growth period; plus   


•
 
any premiums added after the growth period; less   


•
 
any adjustments for withdrawals (as described under “Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments” below) including the withdrawal, if any, which ended the growth period.
   Total Withdrawal Base Adjustments. Gross partial
withdrawals up to the maximum annual withdrawal amount will not reduce the total withdrawal base. Gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount “excess withdrawals” will reduce the total withdrawal base by the
greater of the dollar amount of the withdrawal or on a pro rata basis (possibly to zero). See the SAI for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail. Excess withdrawals may eliminate the guarantee offered by this rider.
   Please note:   


•
 
Upon the death of the annuitant, the 5 for Life with Growth rider terminates and no additional guaranteed withdrawals exist.   


•
 
Since the total withdrawal base of the rider is generally equal to the policy value on the rider date, the maximum annual withdrawal amount may decrease if the policy value
decreases prior to the rider date.    Additional Death Benefit
available with the 5 for Life with Growth Benefit    If you elect the 5 for
Life with Growth benefit, you can also elect for us to add an additional amount to the death benefit payable under the base policy, upon the death of the annuitant. The additional amount will be equal to the excess, if any, of the minimum remaining
withdrawal amount over the base policy death benefit.   
3 


Minimum Remaining Withdrawal Amount. The minimum remaining withdrawal amount on the rider date is the policy value
(less any premium enhancement if the rider is added in the first policy year). After the rider date, the minimum remaining withdrawal amount is equal to:   


•
 
the minimum remaining withdrawal amount on the rider date; plus   


•
 
subsequent premium payments; less   


•
 
adjustments for withdrawals (as described under “Minimum Remaining Withdrawal Amount Adjustments” below).    Minimum Remaining Withdrawal Amount Adjustments. Gross partial withdrawals up to the
maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the minimum remaining withdrawal amount on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Gross partial withdrawals in excess of the maximum annual withdrawal amount will reduce the minimum remaining withdrawal amount by the
greater of the dollar amount of the withdrawal or on a pro rata basis (possibly to zero). See the SAI for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail. Excess withdrawals may eliminate the additional death benefit available
with the 5 for Life with Growth rider.    Please note:   


•
 
If an owner who is not the annuitant dies and the surviving spouse continues the policy, no additional amount is payable. If the policy is not continued, the surviving owner may
elect to annuitize the maximum annual withdrawal amount instead of receiving the cash value. If such an election is made, the policy is terminated and the cash value is forfeited.   


•
 
The minimum remaining withdrawal amount and policy value do not accumulate.    5 for Life with Growth Rider Fee. A rider fee,   .    % of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary if you
do not elect the additional death benefit and   .    % of the total withdrawal base on each rider anniversary if you do elect the additional death benefit, is charged annually prior to annuitization. We
will also deduct the rider fee pro rata upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider (once we have received all necessary regulatory approvals). The rider fee is deducted from each investment choice in proportion to the amount
of policy value in each investment option. Generally, the rider fee is deducted regardless of your values.    Designated Investment Options. If you elect the 5 for Life with Growth benefit, you must allocate 100% of your policy value to one or more of the following “designated funds:”    Asset Allocation – Conservative Portfolio – Service Class    Asset Allocation – Moderate Portfolio – Service Class    Asset Allocation – Moderate Growth Portfolio – Service Class    Transamerica
Money Market – Service Class    Fixed Account    If you elect this rider, you may transfer amounts among the designated funds; however, you cannot transfer any amount to any other
subaccount. After the third rider anniversary, you can terminate this rider. Terminating the rider will result in losing all your benefits under this rider. Starting the next business day you may transfer to a non-designated fund.    Upgrades. You can upgrade the total withdrawal base to the policy value after the
third rider anniversary by sending us written notice (we reserve the right to limit your upgrade election to a 30-day period following a rider anniversary after   
4 


the 4th rider anniversary). At this time the minimum remaining withdrawal amount and maximum annual withdrawal amount will be recalculated. If an upgrade is elected, your current rider will terminate and a new rider will be issued
with a new rider date and its own rider fee percentage (which may be higher than your current rider fee percentage) and growth rate. The new rider effective date will be the date the Company receives all necessary information.    Termination. The 5 for Life with Growth rider will terminate upon the earliest of the
following:   


•
 
the date we receive written notice from you requesting termination of the 5 for Life with Growth rider (you may not terminate the rider before the third rider anniversary);
  


•
 
the annuitant’s death;   


•
 
annuitization; or   


•
 
termination of your policy.    The 5 for Life with Growth rider may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies.

Item 27.    Number of Policyowners    As of August 31, 2005, there were 76,953 Owners of the Policies.
   Item 28.    Indemnification
   The Iowa Code (Sections 490.850 et. seq.) provides for
permissive indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations. The Code also specifies procedures for determining when indemnification payments can be made.
   Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Depositor has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a
director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered), the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction
the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Supplement dated October 31 2016 
to the  Prospectus
dated May 1, 2016  Currently this rider is not available for sale. We will notify you when and if this rider becomes available for sale.
 Effective November 14, 2016, a new optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (“GLWB”) rider, the Transamerica Income Edge rider,
will be available at the time of purchase of the policy. We may permit the rider to be available post-issue at some point in the future. You may elect to purchase the optional Transamerica Income Edge rider which, provides you with: (1) a GLWB;
and (2) an opportunity for increases in the rider withdrawal amount. If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge rider, a certain percentage of your purchase payments and policy value must be allocated to the stable account, the select investment
options and the flexible investment options as described more fully below. If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge rider, you cannot elect another GLWB. Transfers from the stable account are not permitted except upon termination of the rider.
Withdrawals from the stable account are not permitted until all other investment options are depleted of value. The Transamerica Income Edge Rider and additional options may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies, in all
states, and at all times or through all financial intermediaries. For more information regarding options available to you please contact your financial intermediary. Please read this supplement carefully for important details about this rider.

 The following Expense Example is added to the Fee Table and Expense Examples section of the
prospectus:  The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the policy for the time periods indicated. The Example also assumes that your policy has a
5% return each year, the highest Total Portfolio Annual Operating Expenses of any of the portfolios for the year ended December 31, 2015, and the base policy with the combination of available optional features or riders with the highest fees
and expenses, including the Return of Premium Death Benefit and Transamerica Income Edge rider. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions, your costs would be:

This example reflects the higher fee percentage for the Transamerica Income Edge rider, which results in the highest expenses for years 1, 3 and 5. However, in year 10, the Retirement Income Max® rider will have higher fees.

The following is added to the Fee Table Expense Examples section in the prospectus
under- “Optional Rider Charges and Optional Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Riders”:  Transamerica Income
Edge Rider – Withdrawal Base: We use the withdrawal base to calculate the rider withdrawal amount. The withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value.

The following is added to the Transfers section in the prospectus: 
Additional Restrictions for the Transamerica Income Edge Rider. If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge rider, a certain percentage of your policy
value must be allocated to the stable account, the select investment options and the flexible investment options as specified below. See Transamerica Income Edge Rider – Required Allocations. Any transfer requests to and from the
select investment options and flexible investment options will be validated using the prior market day’s policy value to ensure compliance with the required allocations for rebalancing at the time of the request. Transfer requests that do not
comply with the required allocations for rebalancing will be deemed not in good order. Changes in policy values due to market movements on other dates will not be treated as a violation of the required allocations. Transfers to the stable account
are not permitted except at the time of election of the rider. Transfers from the stable account are not permitted except upon termination of the rider. 
The first paragraph in the Investment Restrictions section in the prospectus under “Investment Options”
is deleted in its’ entirely and replaced with the following:  If you elect certain optional riders, you will be subject to investment
restrictions requiring you to invest in certain underlying fund portfolios, which may be referred to (depending on your rider) as designated investment options, flexible investment options and/or select investment options. In addition, certain
optional riders may require you to invest in the stable account.
 A new section titled Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefits is
inserted immediately following Asset Rebalancing in the Additional Features - section of the prospectus: 
You may elect one of the following optional riders under the policy that offers guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefits the Retirement Income Max ® Rider or the Transamerica Income Edge Rider. Important aspects of each of these riders are summarized in the “Appendix – Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Comparison Table”
and are described in more detail below. You should consult with tax and financial professionals to determine which of these riders, if any, is appropriate for you. 
The following is added to the Additional Features section of the prospectus: 
Transamerica Income Edge Rider 
 
If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge Rider identified below, which provides certain guaranteed benefits, the Company
requires a certain percentage of your policy value to be allocated to the stable account and to select investment options, with the remainder to be allocated to the select investment options and flexible investment options. One or more of the select
investment options and flexible investment options may include a volatility control strategy. Volatility control strategies, in periods of high market volatility, could limit your participation in market gains; this may conflict with your
investment objectives by limiting your ability to maximize potential growth of your policy value and, in turn, the value of any guaranteed benefit that is tied to investment performance. Volatility control strategies are intended to help limit
overall volatility and reduce the effects of significant market downturns during periods of high market volatility, providing policy owners with the opportunity for smoother performance and better risk adjusted returns. Volatility control (and
similar terms) can encompass a variety of investment strategies of different types and degrees; therefore, you should read the applicable annuity and underlying fund portfolio prospectuses carefully to understand how these investment strategies may
affect your policy value and rider benefits. The Company’s requirement to invest in accordance with the required allocations, which may include volatility control strategies, may reduce our costs and risks associated with this rider. You pay
an additional fee for the rider benefits which, in part, pay for protecting the rider benefit base from investment losses. Since the rider benefit base does not decrease as a result of investment losses, volatility control strategies might not
provide a meaningful additional benefit to you. You should carefully evaluate with your financial advisor whether to allocate to subaccounts that invest in underlying funds with volatility control strategies, taking into consideration the
potential positive or negative impact that such strategy may have on your investment objectives, your policy value and the benefits under the Transamerica Income Edge Rider. If you determine that underlying funds with volatility control strategies
are not consistent with your investment objectives, there continue to be other investment options available under the Transamerica Income Edge Rider that do not invest in underlying funds that utilize volatility control strategies.

Transamerica Income Edge - Summary 
You may elect to purchase the optional Transamerica Income Edge Rider which provides you with: (1) a GLWB; and (2) an opportunity for increases in
the rider withdrawal amount. This rider is available during the accumulation phase, and requires that you allocate a certain percentage of your policy value to the stable account and to select investment options and flexible investment options some
of which are designed to help manage our risk and support the guarantees under the rider. If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge Rider, you cannot elect another GLWB. The tax rules for qualified policies may limit the value of this rider. Please
consult a qualified tax adviser before electing the Transamerica Income Edge Rider for a qualified policy. Please Note: This rider may not be issued or added to Inherited IRAs (sometimes also referred to as beneficiary IRAs) or a nonqualified
annuity under which death benefits are being distributed under a stretch withdrawal option. The benefits under the Transamerica Income Edge Rider are based on our claims-paying ability.

Under the Transamerica Income Edge Rider, you can receive up to the rider withdrawal amount each rider year (first as withdrawals from the policy value
(excluding the stable account until other investment options are depleted of value), and if necessary because your policy value goes to zero, by other than an excess withdrawal, as payments from us), starting with the rider year immediately
following the annuitant’s (or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) attainment of the minimum benefit age (as provided in your rider) and lasting until the annuitant’s (or the annuitant’s spouse
if the joint life option is elected) death unless your withdrawal base is reduced to zero because of an “excess withdrawal”. See Withdrawal Base Adjustments section below. A rider year begins on the rider date (the date the
rider becomes effective) and thereafter on each anniversary of that date. The withdrawal percentage that is used to determine your rider withdrawal amount and required allocations will be disclosed in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement included with
your prospectus which may be amended from time to time by us.
 All Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplements are also available on the Edgar system at
www.sec.gov (File 333-186032 for TLIC and 333-186036 for TFLIC).
 Of course you can always withdraw an amount up to your cash value pursuant to your
rights under the policy although withdrawals that are excess withdrawals will reduce your withdrawal base and future GLWBs. See “Appendix – Hypothetical Adjusted Partial Surrenders – Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit
Riders” for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail.  If you elect the Transamerica Income Edge Rider, a certain
percentage of your policy value on the rider date must be allocated to the stable account, the select investment options and the flexible investment options, as specified in the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Transfers to and from the
stable account are not permitted. Withdrawals from the stable account are not permitted until all other investment options are depleted of value. Withdrawals from the flexible investment options and select investment options will be deducted on a
pro-rata basis. If you do not wish to maintain the required allocation percentages for the investment options, the rider must be terminated, subject to the termination restrictions and requirements of the rider, prior to making any transfer.
Additional detail regarding the required allocations is provided in the Required Allocations section, below.
 Please note: 
 


 
•
 
You will begin paying the rider charge as of the rider date, even if you do not begin taking withdrawals for many years. We will not refund the charges you have paid under the rider if you never choose to take
withdrawals and/or if you never receive any payments under the rider.   


 
•
 
We have designed this rider to allow for withdrawals from your policy value each rider year that are less than or equal to the rider withdrawal amount. You should not purchase this rider if you plan to take withdrawals
in excess of the rider withdrawal amount, because such excess withdrawals may significantly reduce or eliminate the value of the guarantees provided by the rider. 
 


 
•
 
The longer you wait to start making withdrawals under the benefit, the less time you have to benefit from the guarantee because of decreasing life expectancy as you age. On the other hand, the longer you wait to begin
making withdrawals, the higher your withdrawal percentage may be, and the more opportunities you will have to lock in a higher withdrawal base. You should carefully consider when to begin making withdrawals. There is a risk that you will not begin
making withdrawals at the most financially beneficial time for you.   


 
•
 
Because the GLWB under this rider is accessed through regular withdrawals that do not exceed the rider withdrawal amount, the rider may not be appropriate for you if you do not foresee a need for liquidity and your
primary objective is to take maximum advantage of the tax deferral aspect of the policy.   


 
•
 
All policy value must be allocated to the select and flexible investment options and the stable account, subject to specified allocation percentages as provided in the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. You should
consult with your financial advisor to assist you in determining whether these investment options and required allocations are suited for your financial needs and risk tolerance. 
 


 
•
 
Any amount of withdrawals in any rider year that are in excess of the rider withdrawal amount are excess withdrawals. 
  3





 
•
 
An excess withdrawal may impact the withdrawal base on a greater than dollar-for-dollar basis and may eliminate the benefit. See “Appendix – Hypothetical Adjusted Partial Surrenders – Guaranteed
Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Riders”.   


 
•
 
Upon receiving due proof of death of the annuitant (or the death of the surviving spouse if the joint option is elected), the Transamerica Income Edge rider terminates and all benefits thereunder cease.
  


 
•
 
You may terminate the rider by providing written notice to us requesting termination during the 30 days following the fifth rider anniversary or every fifth rider anniversary thereafter. See Termination
section, below.

If your policy value reaches zero, the Company may require satisfactory evidence a person is alive if a payment is based on that person being alive. A notarized letter may be provided as satisfactory evidence a person
is living.  Like all withdrawals, withdrawals up to the rider withdrawal amount, while this rider is in effect also:

 


 
•
 
reduce your policy value by the amount of the withdrawal;   


 
•
 
reduce your base policy death benefit and other benefits by the amount of the withdrawal;   


 
•
 
may be subject to surrender charges if the withdrawal is greater than the surrender charge free amount;   


 
•
 
may be subject to income taxes and federal tax penalties (see TAX INFORMATION); and   


 
•
 
may be limited or restricted under certain qualified policies (see TAX INFORMATION – Qualified Policies and TAX INFORMATION—Optional Living Benefits). 
Rider Withdrawal Amount. You can withdraw up to the rider withdrawal amount in any rider year (after attainment of the minimum benefit age) from your
policy value without causing an excess withdrawal. See Withdrawal Base Adjustments below.
 The rider withdrawal amount is zero if the
annuitant (or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) has not attained the minimum benefit age of 59 on the rider date and remains zero until the first day of the rider year after the annuitant (or the
annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) has attained the minimum benefit age. On the first day of the rider year after the annuitant (or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected)
has attained the minimum benefit age the rider withdrawal amount is equal to the withdrawal base multiplied by the withdrawal percentage. See applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement for additional information. Surrender charges may apply if your
rider withdrawal amount exceeds your surrender charge free amount.  For qualified policies: If the plan participant (generally the annuitant)
is at least 70 1⁄2 years old, the rider withdrawal amount for that rider year (and each subsequent rider year) is equal to the greater of:

 


 
•
 
the rider withdrawal amount described above; or   


 
•
 
an amount equal to the minimum required distribution amount, if any. The minimum required distribution is calculated based on the rules established by the IRS. The minimum required distribution may only be used if all
of the following are true:   


 
a.
the policy to which this rider is attached is a tax-qualified policy for which IRS minimum required distributions are required,   


 
b.
the minimum required distributions do not start prior to the annuitant’s attained age 70 1/2,   


 
c.
the minimum required distributions are based on either the Uniform Lifetime table or the Joint Life and Last Survivor Expectancy table, 
 


 
d.
the minimum required distributions are based on age of the living annuitant. The minimum required distributions cannot be based on the age of someone who is deceased, 
 


 
e.
the minimum required distributions are based only on the policy to which this rider is attached, and   


 
f.
the minimum required distributions are only for the current rider year. Amounts carried over from past rider years are not considered. 
 


 
g.
If any of the above are not true, then the minimum required distribution is equal to zero and it is not available as a rider withdrawal amount. 
Only amounts calculated as set forth above can be used as the rider withdrawal amount.

If your policy value reaches zero:
  


 
•
 
due to a non-excess withdrawal, then you cannot make premium payments and all other policy features, benefits and guarantees (except those provided by this rider) are terminated. In addition, we will, unless
instructed otherwise, make payments using the current payment instructions on file with us equal to the rider withdrawal amount divided by the frequency of payments. If the younger of the annuitant or annuitant’s spouse has attained the minimum
benefit age and a systematic payout option is not active at the time the policy value equals zero, a monthly payment will begin. If the minimum benefit age has not been attained, the monthly payment will begin on the rider anniversary following the
attainment of the minimum benefit age. Once the payment amount and frequency are established, they cannot be changed and no additional withdrawals will be allowed. Furthermore, any remaining minimum required cash value will be paid on the later of
the annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death. 
  4





 
•
 
due to an excess withdrawal, then your policy will terminate resulting in the termination of this rider. An excess withdrawal that does not cause your policy value to equal zero will not terminate the rider.
 Please note:   


 
•
 
If the rider is added prior to the annuitant (or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) having attained the minimum benefit age, the rider withdrawal amount will be zero until the
beginning of the rider year after the annuitant (or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) has attained the minimum benefit age birthday, however, you will still be charged a rider fee prior to this time.
  


 
•
 
You cannot carry over any portion of your rider withdrawal amount that is not withdrawn during a rider year for withdrawal in a future rider year. This means that if you do not take the entire rider withdrawal amount
during a rider year, you cannot take more than the rider withdrawal amount in the next rider year and maintain the rider’s guarantees.   


 
•
 
Excess withdrawals may cause you to lose the benefit of the rider.   


 
•
 
The select and flexible investment options may be changed by us in the future for policy owners that have not yet elected the rider. Existing policy owners will not be affected. 
Transamerica Income Edge – Withdrawal Percentage 
Withdrawal Percentage. We use the withdrawal percentage to calculate the rider withdrawal amount. The withdrawal percentage is determined by the
annuitant’s age (or the annuitant’s spouse’s age if younger and the joint life option is elected) and the rider duration at the time of the first withdrawal taken on or after the rider anniversary immediately following the annuitant
(or the annuitant’s spouse if younger and the joint life option is elected) having attained the minimum benefit age.  The withdrawal percentage is
disclosed in the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Unless the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement provides otherwise, in order for you to receive the withdrawal percentage reflected in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement:

 


 
•
 
your application must be signed within the time period disclosed in the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement;   


 
•
 
we must receive your completed application within 7 calendar days from the date that the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement is no longer effective; and 
 


 
•
 
the policy must be funded within 60 calendar days from the date that the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement is no longer effective. 
If any of these conditions are not met, your application will be considered not in good order for the current Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. If you decide
to proceed with the purchase of the policy, additional paperwork may be required to issue the policy with the applicable rates in effect at that time. Withdrawal percentages reflected in a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement with an effective period
that does not include the date you signed your application will not apply to your policy. You should not purchase this rider without first obtaining the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. You can contact us at www.transamerica.com to
receive a Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement applicable to you.
 Please note, once established, the withdrawal percentage will not generally increase
even though the annuitant’s age increases except in certain instances involving automatic step-ups. See Automatic Step-Up section below and applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement.

All Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplements are also available on the Edgar system at www.sec.gov (File 333-186032 for TLIC and 333-186036 for TFLIC).

Transamerica Income Edge – Withdrawal Base 
Withdrawal Base. We use the withdrawal base to calculate the rider withdrawal amount. The withdrawal base on the rider date is the policy value. During
any rider year, the withdrawal base is equal to the withdrawal base on the rider date or most recent rider anniversary, plus subsequent premium payments, less subsequent withdrawal base adjustments due to excess withdrawals.

Please note:   


 
•
 
We determine the withdrawal base solely to calculate the rider withdrawal amount and rider fee.   


 
•
 
Your withdrawal base is not a cash value, a surrender value, or a death benefit. It is not available for withdrawal, it is not a minimum return for any subaccount, and it is not a guarantee of policy value.

  5



On each rider anniversary, the withdrawal base will equal the greater of:

 


 
•
 
the current withdrawal base; and   


 
•
 
the policy value on the current rider anniversary (see Automatic Step-Up below).  See
“Appendix – Hypothetical Example of Withdrawal Base Calculation – Transamerica Income Edge Rider” which illustrates the hypothetical example of the withdrawal base calculation. 
Transamerica Income Edge – Automatic Step-Up 
Automatic Step-Up. On each rider anniversary, the rider will receive an automatic step-up if the withdrawal base is equal to the policy value on the
rider anniversary immediately after the withdrawal base reset on the rider anniversary. If the policy value is not greater than the current withdrawal base, then no automatic step-up will occur. The withdrawal percentage (as indicated in the Rate
Sheet Prospectus Supplement) will also increase if you have crossed into another age band or rider year duration prior to the automatic step-up. Please note, the increase is part of the automatic step-up and if no automatic step-up occurs then there
will be no withdrawal percentage increase.
 On each rider anniversary the rider fee percentage may increase (or decrease) at the time of any automatic
step-up. The rider fee percentage will not exceed the maximum rider fee percentage in effect when you purchased the rider.
 Automatic Step-Up Opt
Out. Each time an automatic step-up results in a rider fee percentage increase, you have the option to reject the automatic step-up and reinstate the withdrawal base, withdrawal percentage, and rider fee percentage to their respective amounts
immediately before the automatic step-up, provided that you do so within 30 days after the rider anniversary on which the automatic step-up occurred. Changes as a result of the automatic step-up feature will be reversed. We must receive your
rejection (each time you elect to opt out), in good order, at our Administrative Office within the same 30 day period after the rider anniversary on which the automatic step-up occurred. Opting out of one step-up does not operate as an opt-out of
any future step-ups.
 Transamerica Income Edge – Withdrawal Base Adjustments 
Withdrawal Base Adjustments. Cumulative gross partial withdrawals up to the rider withdrawal amount in any rider year will not reduce the withdrawal
base. Any amount of gross partial withdrawals in excess of the rider withdrawal amount in any rider year (“excess withdrawals”) will reduce the withdrawal base, however, by the greater of the dollar amount of the excess withdrawal (if the
policy value is greater than the withdrawal base) or a pro rata amount (in proportion to the reduction in the policy value when the policy value is less than the withdrawal base), possibly to zero. If an excess withdrawal reduces the
policy value to zero, this rider will terminate. Withdrawal base adjustments occur immediately following excess withdrawals. See “Appendix - Hypothetical Adjusted Partial Surrenders - Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Riders”
for examples showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail, including an excess withdrawal that reduces the withdrawal base by a pro rata amount. The effect of an excess withdrawal is magnified if the policy value is less than the
withdrawal base.  Please Note: You retain all responsibility for monitoring for excess withdrawals. If you take regular or scheduled withdrawals
please pay particular attention to any excess withdrawal because your regular or scheduled non-excess withdrawals may thereafter become excess withdrawals that reduce or eliminate your benefit on an accelerated basis.

Example. Assume you are the owner and annuitant and you make a single premium payment of $100,000 when you are 66 years old. Further assume that you
do not make any withdrawals or subsequent premium payments, no automatic step-ups occurred, but that after six years your policy value has declined to $90,000 solely because of negative investment performance. You could receive up to $6,000 each
rider year for the rest of your life based on an assumed withdrawal percentage of 6.0% for the single life option multiplied by an assumed withdrawal base of $100,000, and assuming that: 
 


 
•
 
you take your first withdrawal when you are age 72,   


 
•
 
you do not withdraw more than the rider withdrawal amount in any one year, and   


 
•
 
there are no future automatic step-ups.  Example continued. Assume the same facts as above,
but assume you withdraw $10,000 when you are 72 years old. That excess withdrawal decreases your future rider withdrawal amount to $5,714. 
Because the withdrawal ($10,000) is in excess of the rider withdrawal amount ($6,000) it impacts the withdrawal base on a greater than dollar-for-dollar
basis.
 Adjusted Partial Withdrawal = Excess Withdrawal Amount * Withdrawal Base prior to the withdrawal / Policy Value after the Rider Withdrawal Amount
but prior to the Excess Withdrawal Amount.
 Excess withdrawal amount = $4,000 ($10,000 - $6,000)

Withdrawal base = $100,000

  6



Policy value after the rider withdrawal amount but prior to the excess withdrawal amount =
$84,000 ($90,000 - $6,000)
 Adjusted partial withdrawal = $4,000 * $100,000 / $84,000 = $4,761.90

New withdrawal base = $95,238.10 ($100,000 - $4,761.90

New rider withdrawal amount = $5,714.29 ($95,238.10 * 6%)

See the “Appendix - Hypothetical Adjusted Partial Surrenders - Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Riders” for examples
showing the effect of hypothetical withdrawals in more detail.   Transamerica Income Edge – Required Allocations 
If you elect this rider, a certain percentage of your policy value on the rider date must be allocated to the stable account, the select investment options and
the flexible investment options, in accordance with the percentages specified in the Required Allocations for Premium Payments table contained in the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. After the rider date, the allocation of all subsequent premium
payments made must also comply with the required allocations for premiums so long as this rider is effective.
 In addition, if you elect this rider, any
transfers to and from the select investment options and the flexible investment options must comply with the percentages specified in the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. Any transfers to and from the select investment options and flexible
investment options will be validated using the prior day’s policy values to ensure compliance with the required allocations for rebalancing at the time of the request. Transfer requests that do not comply with the required allocations for
rebalancing will be deemed not in good order. Changes in policy values due to market movements on other dates will not be treated as a violation of the required allocations. 
Transfers to and from the stable account are not permitted. Withdrawals from the stable account are not permitted until all other investment options are
depleted of value. Withdrawals from the flexible investment options and select investment options will be deducted on a pro-rata basis. If you do not wish to maintain the applicable required allocation percentages, the rider must be terminated,
subject to the rider termination restrictions and requirements, prior to making any transfer. The rider will terminate on the date we receive written notice from you requesting termination if such notice is received by us during the 30 days
following the fifth rider anniversary or any fifth rider anniversary thereafter.
 Enrollment in dollar cost averaging is not available while this rider is
in effect.
 The Stable Account. The stable account is a fixed account option under your policy. Premium payments allocated and amounts
transferred to the stable account become part of our general account. Interests in the general account have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “1933 Act”), nor is the general account registered as an investment
company under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, neither the general account nor any interests therein are generally subject to the provisions of the 1933 or 1940 Acts. Disclosures relating to interests in the general account are, however, subject to
certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities laws relating to the accuracy of statements made in a registration statement. 
Allocations applied to the stable account will be credited interest based on a fixed rate. The interest rates will be applied in increments of at least one
year measured from each premium payment date and will automatically renew and remain in the stable account. The interest credited to the stable account will not be less than the guaranteed minimum effective annual interest rate shown on your policy
(the “guaranteed minimum”). We determine credited rates, which are guaranteed for at least one year, in our sole discretion. You bear the risk that we will not credit interest greater than the guaranteed minimum. 
Withdrawals, surrenders, or transfers (upon termination) from the stable account will not be subject to an excess interest adjustment.

Upon termination of the rider, all amounts in the stable account will be transferred to the money market subaccount available under your policy and no
additional premium payments will be allowed into the stable account. Owners are permitted to provide instructions as to the allocation of the stable account proceeds contained in the money market subaccount to one or more subaccounts, but such
instructions will not be effective prior to the market day after rider termination.
 We guarantee that upon full surrender your cash value attributable to
the fixed account will not be less than the amount required by the applicable state nonforfeiture law at the time the policy is issued.

  7



Select and Flexible Investment Options. As described above, if you elect this rider, you must allocate a
certain percentage of your premium payments and policy value to the available flexible investment options and select investment options. A complete listing of subaccounts designated as flexible investment options and select investment options
appears in the “Appendix – Transamerica Income Edge - Investment Options”. You will be notified if there are changes made to the investment options within the designated groups. Requiring that you allocate a certain percentage of your
premium payments and policy value to the designated investment options, some of which invest in underlying funds that employ strategies that are intended to reduce the risk of loss and/or manage volatility, may reduce investment returns and may
reduce the likelihood that we will be required to use our own assets to pay amounts due under this benefit.  Rebalancing. While this rider is
effective, quarterly rebalancing is required and will take place at the end of each rider quarter on the same date your rider fee is deducted. If the day rebalancing takes place is not a market day, the value of the accumulation units redeemed or
purchased due to rebalancing will be determined as of the next market day. We will automatically transfer amounts among subaccounts according to the most recent rebalancing allocation instructions on file that comply with the required allocations
for rebalancing. On the rider date, your rebalancing allocation instructions will be established using a ratio of your current investment allocation instructions for new premium payments. Because the stable account is not included in the quarterly
rebalancing process and whole percentages are required, it may be necessary for the Company to make adjustments (positive or negative) to the calculated rebalance allocation percentages to accommodate for rounding to the nearest whole percent.
Adjustments needed will be applied to the select investment options and flexible investment options individually to ensure the requirements for each designated group are met. Any adjustments will first be made to the select or flexible investment
option with the greatest allocation.
 If more than one select or flexible investment option has the greatest percentage allocation, the adjustment
will be divided equally among those select and/or flexible investment options with the greatest allocation. If the adjustment cannot be divided equally, we will make adjustments in alphabetical order to the select or flexible investment option(s)
with the greatest percentage allocation. You will be notified in writing of the calculated rebalance allocation percentages prior to the first quarter rebalancing. You will be notified in writing, at rider issue, that the required rebalance has been
set up. You may request changes to your rebalancing allocation instructions before the prior instructions are implemented while this rider remains effective as long as they comply with the required allocations for rebalancing and we receive notice
of your request in good order prior to close of the NYSE on the day the rebalancing is processed. Rebalancing will not cease upon the request of any transfer.

See “Appendix – Transamerica Income Edge – Rebalancing Examples” which illustrates the initial calculation of rebalancing
allocation percentages as well as the rebalancing process.  Please note:   


 
•
 
If you do not wish to maintain the required allocations, the rider must be terminated, subject to the rider termination restrictions and requirements, prior to making any transfer. (See, Transamerica Income
Edge Rider – Termination, below.)   


 
•
 
We can change the list of designated flexible and select investment groups at any time for policy owners that have not yet elected the rider. Existing policy owners will not be affected. 
 


 
•
 
If an underlying fund portfolio informs us that a portfolio will be liquidated or reorganized, we can eliminate the corresponding select or flexible investment option. If this occurs, you will be required to reallocate
values in the affected investment option to other flexible and select investment options in order to meet the allocation requirements. We will provide notice to you if a select or flexible investment option will be eliminated and reallocation is
required. If you do not provide us with new instructions in the time specified in our notice, we will move your money in the affected option to the TA Aegon Government Money Market. 
Transamerica Income Edge – Joint Life Option  If you
elect the Transamerica Income Edge rider, then you can also elect to postpone termination of the rider until the later of the annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death (only if the annuitant’s spouse is eligible to and elects to
continue the policy, see TAX INFORMATION – Tax Status of a Nonqualified Policy – Distribution Requirements). If you elect the Joint Life option, then the withdrawal percentage used to calculate the rider withdrawal amount is
lower than under the single life option. This option may not be permitted in the case of certain non-natural owners.  Please note: If you elect
this option:
  


 
•
 
The withdrawal percentage for each “age at the time of first withdrawal” is lower than under the single life option.   


 
•
 
The annuitant’s spouse (or in certain instances, a non-natural entity acting for the benefit of the annuitant’s spouse) must be either a joint owner along with the annuitant or the sole primary beneficiary
(and there is no joint owner). (Please see Spousal Continuation section for more detail regarding annuitant’s spouse). 
  8





 
•
 
A former spouse of the annuitant cannot continue to keep the policy in force if no longer married to the annuitant at the time of the annuitant’s death. In that event, the rider will terminate and no additional
withdrawals under the rider will be permitted.   


 
•
 
The annuitant’s spouse for purposes of this rider cannot be changed to a new spouse.   


 
•
 
The rider withdrawal percentage is based on the age of the younger of the annuitant and annuitant’s spouse. 
Transamerica Income Edge—Fees  Transamerica
Income Edge Rider Fee. The current rider fee percentage is 1.40% per annum and the maximum rider fee percentage is 2.15%. The rider fee is deducted at the end of each successive rider quarter, on the same day of the month as the rider date.
If a day does not exist in a given month, the first day of the following month will be used. If a rider fee is deducted from a subaccount on a day which is not a market day, the value of accumulation units redeemed will be determined as of the next
market day. The rider fee is calculated and stored at issue and at each subsequent rider quarter for the upcoming quarter. The rider fee will be adjusted for any premium additions and excess withdrawals. It will be deducted automatically from the
flexible investment options and the select investment options on a pro rata basis at the end of each rider quarter. After those investment options are depleted of value, the rider fee will be deducted from the stable account. 
On an annual basis, in general terms, the rider fee is the rider fee percentage times the withdrawal base. Specifically, the quarterly rider fee is calculated
by multiplying (A) by (B) by (C), where:   


 
(A)
is the withdrawal base;   


 
(B)
is the rider fee percentage; and   


 
(C)
is the number of days in the rider quarter divided by the total number of days in the applicable rider year. 
The following example uses these assumed values: Initial Premium = $100,000; Withdrawal Base = $100,000; Rider Fee percentage = 1.40%; and 91
total days in the rider quarter.
 Example 1: Calculation at rider issue for first quarter rider fee. The rider fee is:

= 100,000*0.0140*(91/365)
 =
1,400*(91/365)
 = $349.04
 We will
assess a portion of the rider fee upon full surrender of the policy or other termination of the rider by adjusting the quarterly fee based on the number of days remaining until the end of the next rider quarter for the period beginning on the first
day of the most recent rider quarter and ending on the date of termination.
 On each rider anniversary the rider fee percentage may increase at the time
of an automatic step-up. Each time an automatic step-up results in a rider fee percentage increase, you will have the option to reject the automatic step-up and reinstate the withdrawal base and rider fee percentage to their respective amounts
immediately before the automatic step-up (adjusted for any subsequent premium payments or withdrawals), provided that you do so within 30 calendar days after the rider anniversary on which the automatic step-up occurred. We must receive your
rejection, in good order, at our Administrative Office within the 30 day period after the rider anniversary on which the automatic step-up occurred.

Please note regarding the rider fee:   


 
•
 
Because the rider fee is a percentage of the withdrawal base, it could be a much higher percentage of your policy value, particularly in the event that your policy value decreases significantly. 
 


 
•
 
Because the rider fee is a percentage of the withdrawal base, the amount of the rider fee we deduct will increase if the withdrawal base increases (although the percentage(s) may remain the same) 
Rider Fee Adjustment for Premium Payments and Excess Withdrawals. A rider fee adjustment will be calculated for subsequent premium payments and excess
withdrawals because these events will change the withdrawal base. The rider fee adjustment may be positive or negative and will be added to or subtracted from the rider fee to be collected.

The following example uses these assumed values: All initial values as in Example 1; Subsequent Premium = $10,000; and 20 remaining days in the
rider quarter.
 Example 2: Calculation for first quarter rider fee adjustment for a subsequent premium. The fee adjustment is:

= 10,000*0.0140*(20/365)
 =
140*(20/365)
 = $7.67

  9



Total fee assessed at the end of the first rider quarter (assuming no further rider fee
adjustments):
 = $7.67 + 349.04

= $356.71
 The following two
examples used assumed fees and values. The assumed rider year is not a leap year.
 Example 3: Calculation for second quarter fee
at beginning of second rider quarter assuming withdrawal base of $110,000 and a fee percentage of 1.40%.
 =110,000*0.0140(91/365)

=1,540*(91/365)
 =$383.95

Example 4: Calculation for second quarter fee and an excess withdrawal that results in a pro-rata reduction in the withdrawal base.
Assuming beginning values as in Example 3, plus adjustment for gross partial withdrawal of $10,000 taken with 40 days remaining in the second rider quarter. Assumes withdrawal percentage of 5% of policy value of $93,500 prior to the transaction and
change in withdrawal base as follows:
 Rider Withdrawal Amount (RWA) = Withdrawal Base * Withdrawal Percentage = $110,000 * .05 =
$5,500
 Excess Withdrawal = Difference between assumed withdrawal amount and RWA = $10,000 - $5,500 = $4,500

Withdrawal Base Adjustment = Maximum of Excess Withdrawal and Pro-Rata Withdrawal Amount (Excess Withdrawal * Withdrawal Base prior to
withdrawal/Policy Value after RWA has been withdrawn but before excess withdrawal) = Maximum of $4,500 and ($4,500 * $110,000/ ($93,500-$5,500)) = Maximum of $4,500 and $5,625 = $5,625

Fee adjustment as follows:
 =
$-5,625 * 0.0140 * (40/365)
 = $-78.75 * (40/365)

= $-8.63
 The total fee
assessed at the end of the second rider quarter (assuming no further rider fee adjustments)
 = $383.95 – 8.63 
= $375.32
 The new
withdrawal base = $110,000 - $5,625 = $104,375

•
 
the date of a change in ownership or assignment which violates the owner and annuitant relationship requirements as contained in the rider; 
 


 
•
 
prior to your policy value reaching zero, the date on which we receive in good order, required information to process a death claim for the annuitant (or if the joint life option is elected, the later of the
annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death);   


 
•
 
on or after your policy value equals zero, upon annuitant’s death (or if the joint life option is elected, the later of the annuitant’s or annuitant’s spouse’s death); 
 


 
•
 
the date of annuitization (however, if you have reached your maximum annuity commencement date you may choose an annuitization option which guarantees you lifetime payments in an amount equal to your rider withdrawal
amount); or 
  10





 
•
 
the date we receive written notice from you requesting termination if such notice is received by us during the 30 days following the fifth rider anniversary or any fifth rider anniversary thereafter. 
Please note: This rider terminates upon annuitization and there is a maximum annuity commencement date at which time your policy will be annuitized
according to its terms. However, if you have reached your maximum annuity commencement date, we will allow you to annuitize your policy and elect to receive lifetime annuity payments which are at least equal to your rider withdrawal amount.

The Transamerica Income Edge rider and additional options may vary for certain policies and may not be available for all policies, in all states, at all
times or through all financial intermediaries. We may discontinue offering this benefit at any time. In some cases, a benefit not available through a financial intermediary may be obtained by contacting us directly. For more information on the
options for electing a benefit, please contact your financial intermediary or our Administrative Office.  The Other Information - State

APPENDIX 
GUARANTEED LIFETIME WITHDRAWAL BENEFIT 
TRANSAMERICA INCOME EDGE – REBALANCING EXAMPLES 
The following demonstrates, on a purely hypothetical basis, the rebalancing mechanics of this guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit. The investment
restrictions, rider fee percentages, and withdrawal percentages for your rider may vary from the percentages used below.
 Rebalancing Examples 
The following examples assume the initial premium allocations listed in the table below, which we assume satisfy the premium investment requirements provided
in the Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement.

 Example 1: Calculation at rider issue for the rebalance allocations:

The Stable Account portion of the Policy Value is not included in the quarterly Rebalance, therefore the rebalancing allocation percentages are calculated by
multiplying the initial premium allocation percentages for the Select Investment Options and Flexible Investment Options by a ratio. The ratio is calculated by taking 100%, divided by 100% less the Stable Account premium allocation percentage. The
ratio for this example would be 100% / (100% - 20%) = 1.25.

 Whole percentages are required for the rebalancing percentages and must sum up to equal 100%. To satisfy this requirement and
ensure the rebalance allocation requirement is met for each of the investment options, the sum of the Select Investment Options rebalancing percentage is rounded to the nearest whole percent (hereafter referred to as Select Rebalance Total) but no
less than the minimum allocation for rebalance. The Select Rebalance Total is deducted from 100% to get the total Flexible Investment Options rebalancing percentage (hereafter referred to as Flexible Rebalance Total). The Select Rebalance Total and
Flexible Rebalance Total percentages are the end result which will be achieved by the quarterly Rebalance.

 We apply the same ratio and rounding to each individual investment option chosen and sum up the total Select
and total Flexible Investment Options separately. The totals are compared to Select Rebalance Total and Flexible Rebalance Total to determine where any adjustments need to be made. In the example below, adjustments will need to be made to the Select
Investment Options to bring the total percentage up to 38% and the Flexible Investment Options down to 62%, per the result from Table 1.  Table 2

 To get the total Select Investment Options rebalancing percent to equal 38%, we must add 1% to one of the
funds. Any adjustments will first be made equally to the fund(s) with the greatest allocation. If there are multiple funds with the greatest allocation and the adjustments cannot be divided equally, we will adjust in alphabetical order the fund(s)
with the greatest allocation. In the example below, we made the adjustment to the Select Investment Option Fund A.
 To get the total
Flexible Investment Options rebalancing percent to 62%, we must subtract 2% from one or more funds. Since there is only one fund with the greatest allocation, we have made the adjustment to the Flexible Investment Option Fund C.

 Benefit:  Provides:
(1) Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (“GLWB”)—i.e., a series of cash withdrawals (and payments from us, if necessary)
regardless of the performance of the designated investment options that you select. (2) Growth —On each of the first 10 rider
anniversaries, we add a growth credit to your withdrawal base if no withdrawal occurred during the preceding rider year. The growth credit is equal to the growth percentage multiplied by the withdrawal base immediately before the rider anniversary.
The growth percentage is disclosed in the applicable Rate Sheet Prospectus Supplement. (3) Automatic Step-Up —We will automatically step-up the
withdrawal base on each rider anniversary. You can opt out of the automatic step-up if the automatic step-up would result in an increase in the rider fee percentage.

Item 27.
Number of Contract Owners  As of September 30, 2016, there were 177 Contract owners.

 


Item 28.
Indemnification  The Iowa Code (Sections 490.850 et. seq.) provides for permissive
indemnification in certain situations, mandatory indemnification in other situations, and prohibits indemnification in certain situations. The Code also specifies procedures for determining when indemnification payments can be made.

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Depositor has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is,
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
being registered), the Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy
as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
