Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

      Corporate


NORWALK, Conn. —  Xerox (NYSE: XRX) announced today the appointment of Joseph J. Echevarria, the former chief executive officer of Deloitte LLP, and Cheryl G. Krongard, a former senior partner with Apollo Management LP, to the Xerox board of directors effective January 1, 2017. With these additions, the Xerox Board will comprise eleven directors.
“We’re pleased to have Joe and Cheryl, two highly successful professionals with extensive governance experience, join our board,” said Xerox Chairman and CEO Ursula Burns. “Xerox will greatly benefit from Joe’s knowledge of international business and professional services and Cheryl’s expertise in institutional asset management, as we begin our exciting next phase after our separation into two independent companies.”
Mr. Echevarria is also on the board of directors of the Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Unum Group, and Pfizer Inc. Mrs. Krongard currently serves as a director on the boards of Legg Mason, Inc. and Air Lease Corporation.
About Xerox
Xerox is helping change the way the world works.

Our employees create meaningful innovations and provide business process services, printing equipment, software and solutions that make a real difference for our clients and their customers in 180 countries. On January 29, 2016, Xerox announced its plans to separate into two independent, publicly traded companies – Xerox Corporation, which will be comprised of the company’s Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses, and Conduent Incorporated, a business process services company. 
Forward-Looking Statements
This release may contain “forward-looking statements” as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “intend,” “will,” “should” and similar expressions, as they relate to us, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements reflect management’s current beliefs, assumptions and expectations and are subject to a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ materially. Such factors include but are not limited to: changes in economic conditions, political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements and tax matters in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we do business; changes in foreign currency exchange rates; our ability to successfully develop new products, technologies and service offerings and to protect our intellectual property rights; the risk that multi-year contracts with governmental entities could be terminated prior to the end of the contract term and that civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions could be imposed on us if we fail to comply with the terms of such contracts and applicable law; the risk that our bids do not accurately estimate the resources and costs required to implement and service very complex, multi-year governmental and commercial contracts, often in advance of the final determination of the full scope and design of such contracts or as a result of the scope of such contracts being changed during the life of such contracts; the risk that subcontractors, software vendors and utility and network providers will not perform in a timely, quality manner; service interruptions; actions of competitors and our ability to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations; our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our products and services and to maintain and improve cost efficiency of operations, including savings from restructuring actions and the relocation of our service delivery centers; the risk that individually identifiable information of customers, clients and employees could be inadvertently disclosed or disclosed as a result of a breach of our security systems; the risk in the hiring and retention of qualified personnel; the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred; our ability to recover capital investments; the risk that our Services business could be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in managing the start-up of new contracts; the collectability of our receivables for unbilled services associated with very large, multi-year contracts; reliance on third parties, including subcontractors, for manufacturing of products and provision of services; our ability to expand equipment placements; interest rates, cost of borrowing and access to credit markets; the risk that our products may not comply with applicable worldwide regulatory requirements, particularly environmental regulations and directives; the outcome of litigation and regulatory proceedings to which we may be a party; the possibility that the proposed separation of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) business from the Document Technology and Document Outsourcing business will not be consummated within the anticipated time period or at all, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors; the potential for disruption to our business in connection with the proposed separation; the potential that BPO and Document Technology and Document Outsourcing do not realize all of the expected benefits of the separation; and other factors that are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section, the “Legal Proceedings” section, the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section and other sections of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 and our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Such factors also include, but are not limited to, the factors that are set forth in the “Risk Factors” section, the “Legal Proceedings” section and other sections of the Conduent Incorporated Form 10 Registration Statement, as amended, filed with the SEC.

Echevarria, 54, was selected in 2007 to serve in his current role as U.S. managing partner and chief operating officer, Deloitte LLP, leading approximately 50,000 professionals in nearly 90 cities throughout the United States and in India. He is responsible for all of Deloitte's business subsidiaries, which deliver audit, tax, consulting and financial advisory services, as well as all of its shared service functions.
For Echevarria, an auditor himself, the critical role Deloitte plays in serving the investor public is of paramount importance. "More than ever, we recognize our role in maintaining the integrity of the capital markets and the reliance placed on audited financial statements. The highest standard of professionalism and quality in this area is one of my top priorities," said Echevarria. 
"I am deeply honored to be elected by my partners and principals to be CEO of this great firm.  As the largest professional services organization in the U.S., we have an obligation to lead," continued Echevarria. "Excellence in all of the professional services we provide constitutes the foundation of our success.  As markets were shaken and major players disappeared overnight, we've made a clear choice to focus on superior performance, innovation and growth across all our practice areas. Great firms are growth firms." 
"Talent is the engine of our excellence, innovation and growth," Echevarria added.  "I am proud of the fact that our people are more diverse than ever before; it has made us a better organization and more attractive to top talent."  In recognition of his leadership in diversity, the Association of Latino Professionals in Finance and Accounting (ALPFA) named Echevarria "Executive of the Year in 2007" and he now serves on ALPFA's Corporate Advisory Board.  
Since joining in 1978, Echevarria has held a number of leadership positions including Deloitte LLP's deputy managing partner and Southeast region audit managing partner for Deloitte & Touche LLP.  Echevarria serves as chair of Deloitte's Operating Committee and is a member of its Executive and Succession Planning Committees.  He also holds positions in several committees and boards in the DTTL member firms network including the Americas Executive.  He earned his bachelor's degree in business administration from the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida, where he serves on the University's School of Business Administration Board of Overseers and is currently an Executive in Residence. Echevarria is also a member of the Orange Bowl Committee.
Punit Renjen
As chairman and chief executive officer of Deloitte Consulting LLP, Renjen, 49, has led the significant growth of the consulting practice – enhancing its market position despite the recession and helping Deloitte Consulting become one of the largest consulting services providers in the U.S. By fostering greater collaboration across Deloitte's subsidiaries and industry practices, Renjen also helped Deloitte become a leader in key, high-growth markets such as sustainability, business analytics, heath care and the U.S. federal government.
Renjen was recognized as one of Consulting magazine's top consultants in 2007. He also has guided Deloitte Consulting to be recognized as one of the "2010 Best Firms to Work For" by Consulting magazine and as one of the top firms in Vault's Guide to the Top 50 Management and Strategy Consulting Firms. Under Renjen's leadership, Deloitte Consulting has experienced the highest-ever levels of satisfaction and engagement of its talent.
"This is a great privilege, and I deeply appreciate the partnership's confidence in me," said Renjen. "I share Sharon Allen's vision for Deloitte – to be the 'Standard of Excellence.' Setting this standard demands effective governance, transparency, accountability and uncompromised quality. I am committed to leading the board in providing valuable oversight and strategic guidance to management, and also to representing our exceptional organization and culture with external stakeholders."
Renjen has held many key leadership roles during his more than 23 years of experience with the consulting practice. He currently serves on the DTTL board of directors and Global Consulting Executive Committee. Previously, he was the DTTL's global consulting strategy and operations leader and mergers and acquisitions consultative services leader. Renjen is an active speaker on college campuses and is a member of the board of trustees of Willamette University in Salem, Oregon where he earned his master's degree in management with honors.
Deloitte has been recognized 12 times on FORTUNE magazine's list of the "100 Best Companies to Work For" since 1998; ranked No.1 in the most recent Businessweek "Best Places to Launch a Career" ranking; and ranked No.1 on the Top 100 Firms by Accounting Today. Recently, Deloitte was ranked No. 8 on The 2011 DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity list, and has been inducted into Working Mother magazine's Hall of Fame.

NEW YORK, Feb. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- BNY Mellon, a global leader in investment management and investment services, announced today that its Board of Directors has elected Joseph Echevarria, the former Chief Executive Officer of Deloitte LLP, as an independent director, effective immediately. With the addition of Echevarria, BNY Mellon's Board will have 15 directors, 14 of whom are independent. Echevarria will also be included in the company's slate of nominees for election to the Board at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. 
"Joe is a well-respected and accomplished leader in his field, acknowledged for his expertise in and understanding of the financial services industry globally," said BNY Mellon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerald L. Hassell. "His financial and accounting credentials will be complementary to the Board and our management team as we execute against our strategic priorities and continue to deliver innovative solutions to our clients around the world." 
Echevarria will join the Audit Committee and the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee of BNY Mellon's Board of Directors.
Echevarria joined Deloitte in 1978 and rapidly advanced into increasingly senior leadership positions at the firm, including U.S. Managing Partner for Operations, prior to being named Chief Executive Officer in 2011. He retired from the firm last year.

Echevarria is the fourth new Board member appointed to BNY Mellon's Board of Directors in the last 10 months.  During that time, the company has appointed Jeffrey A. Goldstein, a former Under Secretary of the United States Treasury for Domestic Finance and currently an executive at the private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC; John M. Hinshaw, Executive Vice President of Technology and Operations at HP; and Edward P. Garden, Chief Investment Officer and a founding partner of Trian Fund Management, L.P.
