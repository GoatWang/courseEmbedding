Equity Strategy Composites
Fiduciary’s objective is to buy durable businesses at value prices in order to achieve superior investment results over a three- to five-year time horizon. The essential tenets to our investment philosophy are:

We utilize a business owner’s approach to investing and thoroughly investigate the economics of the business and the qualities of management of each company.
Our approach is contrarian in nature as we invest in companies that have stumbled or are temporarily out of favor with the market, and hence improperly priced.
Our goal is to invest in durable business franchises that are selling at a discount to their intrinsic value.
We believe our investment process of purchasing good companies at low valuations will achieve superior risk-adjusted returns over a three- to five-year time horizon.

WelchBiographyPartner and Managing DirectorTSG Consumer PartnersWisconsin Naming PartnersIn 2007, the Wisconsin School of Business received an unprecedented gift totaling $85 million from a group of 13 alumni who formed the “Wisconsin Naming Partnership” to support the school’s mission. The gift has since grown to  $110 million and a total of 17 naming partners. Three naming partners remain anonymous.
The Wisconsin naming gift is the first of its kind received by a U.S. business school. Conventional business school naming gifts adopt the name of a single donor in perpetuity. By preserving the Wisconsin name for 20 years, this gift leaves open the option of future naming gifts. During that time, the school will not be named for a single donor or entity. This unprecedented naming partnership will uphold tradition and greatly enhance the value of the school to students, the campus, and the state. 
The Wisconsin Naming Partnership will provide strategic advice to the Wisconsin School of Business, including future naming opportunities.
