Faculty and ResearchThe Kellogg School faculty is an esteemed group of scholars and practitioners, and members provide a rich source of international experience in professional management problems and practices. Faculty members combine real-world and academic knowledge of management problems to augment their theoretical training. Senior faculty members also teach courses to senior executives through the Kellogg School’s executive programs. This approach reinforces faculty research and keeps faculty members abreast of changes in corporate practices. All Kellogg School courses combine theory and practice. Teaching methods include case study, field study, seminars, simulations, and independent work. Faculty members choose the method most appropriate to the material and their individual styles. Research is a vital component of Kellogg’s program, and faculty members have developed groundbreaking theories in many academic fields, such as marketing, banking, strategy, and game theory. There are several research centers, on topics ranging from dispute resolution to banking. Several scholarly journals are edited at Kellogg, two of which—the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy and Games and Economic Behavior—were founded here. The Journal of Financial Intermediation was also founded at Kellogg.

What new MileagePlus initiatives has United launched? Our MileagePlus frequent-flyer program continues to lead the industry. Global Traveler readers named MileagePlus the world’s best frequent-flyer program in 2013 for the 10th consecutive year. In 2013, for the fourth year, IdeaWorksCompany’s annual study named MileagePlus as offering the most saver-award availability among the global U.S. carriers.
In 2013, we launched RewardsPlus with Marriott, the industry’s largest-ever combination of frequent-traveler programs, offering reciprocal elite status for our top Premier travelers and Marriott’s top customers. We also joined with Mercedes-Benz USA to offer incentives to MileagePlus Premiers when they purchase or lease certain new Mercedes-Benz models, and to offer a tarmac-transfer service to many Global Services members making connections at our largest hubs. Plus, we introduced the MileagePlus Small Business Network, through which businesses, in addition to individuals, can earn and redeem miles. These initiatives are just part of this year’s advances, and there are more developments in the works.
What is the most challenging aspect of keeping your frequent-flyer program innovative? The most challenging aspect is continuing to advance United’s business and loyalty program in economically sound ways, executing new developments at our scale, and recognizing the differing types of our very wide and diverse range of customers.
