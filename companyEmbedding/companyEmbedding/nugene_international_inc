Helpful reviews that aren't fake. Competitive prices though I wish they were a bit lower instead of needing coupons. Free gifts are fun but sometimes the selection isn't great.

It is a private label product made by a company in Florida. I have used it for years and it works very well. I ordered from LovelySkin because the packaging from the last group from which I ordered was impossible. There is some type of inadequate "automatic" dispenser under the lid, but it does not work for me. It impossible to remove the entire lid so that I could access the product directly without using a hammer and screwdriver! I will continue to search for a supplier that using reasonable packaging.

In this context, forward-looking statements often address NuGene's expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and often contain words such as "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "believe," "seek," "see," "will," "would," or "target." Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain, such as statements about our current and future sales, planned operations, marketing activities and other operational, sales and financial plans. These may include our ability to convert pre-order commitments/wins into orders; timing of planned and anticipated product deliveries; the price we realize on orders since commitments/wins are stated at list prices; customer actions or developments such as customer returns and other factors that may affect the level of demand and performance of the major industries and customers we serve; the impact of regulation and regulatory, investigative and legal proceedings and legal compliance risks, including the impact of regulation and litigation; adverse market conditions, timing of and ability to obtain required regulatory approvals, or other factors relating to us; the impact of potential information technology or data security breaches; and the other factors that are described in "Risk Factors" in NuGene's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. These or other uncertainties may cause our actual future results to be materially different than those expressed in our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update our forward-looking statements. This document also contains non-GAAP financial information. Management uses this information in its internal analysis of results and believes that this information may be informative to investors in gauging the quality of our financial performance, identifying trends in our results and providing meaningful period-to-period comparisons.Image Available: http://www2.marketwire.com/mw/frame_mw?attachid=2859008ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next6 Under-Eye Concealers That Are Better Than YSL's Touche EclatRackedEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredCan Type 2 Diabetes Be Reversed?The Doctors TVAfter you get your free food samples, you’ll want to add these 17 beauty products from Costco to your basketHello GigglesUW researchers discover a recipe to regenerate retinal cells in miceGeekWireDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredGlaxo (GSK) Beats Q2 Earnings, Misses SalesZacksKristin Beck, transgender Navy SEAL hero: 'Let's meet face to face and you tell me I'm not worthy'Business InsiderShark Tank's Daymond John: Retailers must 'over-provide' for the customerYahoo FinanceAre You Still Interested in a Travel Rewards Card?Wise BreadSponsoredAP Exclusive: Boy Scouts chief expected a fiery Trump speechAssociated PressAmazon’s Echo rivaled by Xiaomi and Facebook: rptYahoo Finance Video7 insights from looking at 10 million expense reportsYahoo FinanceWomen Everywhere Should Carry This Tiny DeviceSiren SongSponsoredPhil Mickelson trash-talked Jordan Spieth at the Open Championship — and Phil is going to have to eat his wordsBusiness InsiderTrump’s big Foxconn announcement will bring jobs — and robotsYahoo FinanceSens.

The company will be giving away one of its premier products, NuCell Universal Serum, to more than 50 lucky 'Extra' audience attendees as well as to selected visitors of the 'Extra' website.  NuCell Universal Serum is formulated to improve skin texture and thickness, reduce the signs of aging and restore the skin's natural luminosity and health. The product retails for $299.99. For those that couldn't attend the 'Extra' taping, entries can be submitted online until February 25, 2015 for a chance to receive one of five Universal Serum sets.
