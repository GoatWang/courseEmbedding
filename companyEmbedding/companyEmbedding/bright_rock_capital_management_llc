Our Process



 Built For Success Bright Rock Quality Large Cap Philosophy We build our portfolios with high-quality companies that deliver strong, stable earnings consistency. Our selection process starts with our proprietary quality screening metrics, followed by rigorous quantitative research and complimented with a disciplined bottom-up fundamental analysis. Bright Rock Mid Cap Growth Philosophy  We believe in constructing well diversified portfolios of high quality companies with solid financials, seasoned management and sustainable distinct advantages. We believe in a bottom up, fundamental research effort aimed at identifying companies with attractive earnings growth prospects. We believe that attractive earnings growth prospects are the critical driver for stock price appreciation.    COMMITMENT   We buy companies as a result of deep fundamental research based on 10+ years of mid cap portfolio management expertise. While we are aware of the trends and sector considerations that may impact an opportunity over the short term, we are investing in companies that we believe in and want to invest in for the long term. Diligent, hands on analysis has been the driver of our process for more than a decade.     DISCIPLINE   Regardless of how much we may like a particular company, a solid balance sheet is our golden rule. We seek high quality companies first and foremost; companies with the balance sheets and demonstrated discipline and commitment to reinvest, to maximize technology, to be in-business over the long term.     GROWTH   We seek real, organic growth; not growth by acquisition. We invest in companies that are driven to deliver the best possible products to the market, never resting on old ideas nor growing solely through often uncompelling acquisitions. Ideally, profits drive R&D, applied technology and market leadership.

Brings Established Institutional Investment Management Capability to 
      Market






June 02, 2010 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



HANOVER, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Rockland Trust is pleased to announce the establishment of Bright Rock 
      Capital Management, LLC (Bright Rock) a wholly owned subsidiary 
      dedicated to institutional investment management. Beginning today, 
      Bright Rock’s institutional investment management products and services 
      are available to the global institutional market.
    

      Rockland Trust and Bright Rock Capital Management combined assets under 
      management currently exceed $1.3 billion, and include investment 
      management products across the United States equity and fixed income 
      markets. In launching Bright Rock, Rockland Trust has affirmed its focus 
      on providing institutional investors with access to best of breed 
      products managed by the firm. Supported by the $4.5 billion Rockland 
      Trust infrastructure and resources, Bright Rock’s investment management 
      team averages 25 years of experience and maintains a strong and growing 
      track record in several investment styles, including Mid Cap Growth, 
      Small Cap Growth, and Quality Large Cap.
    

      “Consistent with the Rockland Trust commitment to excellence on behalf 
      of our clients, we have established Bright Rock to ensure that our 
      clients receive the full focus and attention of the organization, 
      specific to their areas of need. In Bright Rock, we see an opportunity 
      to provide institutional investors with direct access to industry 
      leading and highly focused investment management capabilities across the 
      US equity markets and beyond,” noted David Smith, CFA, the firm’s Chief 
      Investment Officer.
    

      “With a team of dedicated investment professionals, deep infrastructure, 
      and a commitment to service our customers, we believe that Bright Rock 
      has many advantages in today’s marketplace. Our dedication to deep, 
      fundamental research and analysis is core to our philosophy, and is the 
      essence of Bright Rock’s value proposition to the market,” noted Doug 
      Butler, CFA, CFP and Director of Research for the firm.
    

      Bright Rock will offer both separately managed accounts as well as 
      mutual funds. Critical to the needs of large institutions, Bright Rock 
      will have the capacity to customize mandates across the US equity 
      spectrum, with specific focus on the Mid Cap Growth, Small Cap Growth,

Cornell University law professor Michael C. Dorf argues that if President Trump were to pardon himself, that action itself would not cause a constitutional crisis, but other actions Trump has already taken have already placed us far along a road to a constitutional crisis.
