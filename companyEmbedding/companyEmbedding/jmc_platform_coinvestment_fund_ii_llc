JMC expands business development team after successful close of second fund

JMC Capital Partners (JMC), a private equity buyout firm focusing on industrial product and technology businesses, has expanded Business Development Team following the recent closing of its second fund at USD206 million.

With the addition of three more business development professionals, JMC continues its efforts to strengthen relationships with "lower-lower" market founders and business owners of unique industrial companies as well as expand its outreach to investment bankers, advisors and business brokers. 
 
Todd Rainville, who joined JMC as Partner in February following 20 years of private equity and finance experience at several Boston area private equity firms, leads the business development effort. New additions to the team include Greg Schultz as Vice President, as well as Tyler Ashley and Mike Gianelli as Associates. The team also includes Kevin Greener (Vice President), who has been with JMC for 3 years pursuing investment opportunities and developing relationships with intermediaries, and Andrea Leung (Marketing Manager), who joined JMC in 2015 and manages all marketing, PR and social media programs for the firm.
 Greg Schultz, Vice President, joined JMC from Launch Angels, a university affiliated co-investment fund platform, where he was Vice President. Previously, Greg was a growth investor at Symmetric Capital, a Boston-based private equity firm, where he sourced and executed transactions, and provided board-level oversight to lower-middle market companies that had self-funded to $10-50MM in revenues.  
 
Tyler Ashley, Associate, joined JMC with four years of business development experience as a Sales Planner with BBC America, and previously as an Account Director at Bluewolf Group, a Salesforce.com consultancy.  Tyler worked on a part-time basis at JMC over the past 8 months while completing his MBA.  
 
Mike Gianelli, Associate, joined JMC after working as an investment banking analyst with Alantra (formerly C.W. Downer) in Boston supporting a range of M&A transactions, and serving as an analyst with Greenspring Associates, a venture capital fund-of-funds and secondary investment firm. 
 
Todd Rainville, Partner and head of the Business Development Team, says: "JMC has the great benefit of focusing only on the industrial space - in tangible product and technology businesses.  Even with this emphasis, like most private equity firms, we recognise the need to further our relationships with the right intermediaries active in our market with smaller companies, and CEOs and business owners themselves.  reg, Tyler and Mike's skill sets will be an enormous help to this effort."

BOSTON, June 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- JMC Capital Partners ("JMC"), a private equity buyout firm focusing on industrial product and technology businesses, is pleased to announce its newly expanded Business Development Team in conjunction with the recent closing of JMC's second fund of $206 million.  








With the addition of three more business development professionals, JMC continues its efforts to strengthen relationships with "lower-lower" market founders and business owners of unique industrial companies as well as expand its outreach to investment bankers, advisors and business brokers. 
Todd Rainville, who joined JMC as Partner in February following 20 years of private equity and finance experience at several Boston area private equity firms, leads the business development effort. New additions to the team include Greg Schultz as Vice President, as well as Tyler Ashley and Mike Gianelli as Associates. The team also includes Kevin Greener (Vice President), who has been with JMC for 3 years pursuing investment opportunities and developing relationships with intermediaries, and Andrea Leung (Marketing Manager), who joined JMC in 2015 and manages all marketing, PR and social media programs for the firm.
Greg Schultz - Vice PresidentGreg Schultz joined JMC from Launch Angels, a university affiliated co-investment fund platform, where he was Vice President. Previously, Greg was a growth investor at Symmetric Capital, a Boston-based private equity firm, where he sourced and executed transactions, and provided board-level oversight to lower-middle market companies that had self-funded to $10-50MM in revenues.  View Bio
Tyler Ashley - AssociateTyler Ashley joined JMC with four years of business development experience as a Sales Planner with BBC America, and previously as an Account Director at Bluewolf Group, a Salesforce.com consultancy.  Tyler worked on a part-time basis at JMC over the past 8 months while completing his MBA.  View Bio
Mike Gianelli - AssociateMike Gianelli joined JMC after working as an investment banking analyst with Alantra (formerly C.W. Downer) in Boston supporting a range of M&A transactions, and serving as an analyst with Greenspring Associates, a venture capital fund-of-funds and secondary investment firm. View Bio
Todd Rainville, Partner and head of the Business Development Team, continued, "JMC has the great benefit of focusing only on the industrial space - in tangible product and technology businesses.  Even with this emphasis, like most private equity firms, we recognize the need to further our relationships with the right intermediaries active in our market with smaller companies, and CEOs and business owners themselves.  Greg, Tyler and Mike's skill sets will be an enormous help to this effort."
