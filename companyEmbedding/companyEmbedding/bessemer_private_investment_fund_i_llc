Purpose: Designed to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in a diversified set of
equities across market capitalizations, primarily in developed markets.
Process: Large capitalization companies are selected based on their sustainable growth rates, high
earnings quality, attractive valuations, and improving fundamentals. Small and mid-size companies
are selected on the basis of strong business models as measured by highly visible cash flow
generation, reasonable capital needs, and aligned management teams. 
Summary information is available below: 
                     
All Cap Core




Purpose: Designed to 1) achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in a concentrated selection of stocks of large capitalization companies, and 2) provide primary exposure to public equity markets together with Large Cap Strategies. 
Process: Build a portfolio of companies with sustainable growth, quality businesses, attractive valuations, and improving fundamentals.  While the strategy's mandate is global, the focus is currently on U.S. stocks.  The portfolio typically consists of 35 to 45 stocks.
Summary information is available below: 
                     
Large Cap Core




Purpose: Designed to 1) achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in stocks of large capitalization companies in developed and emerging markets, and 2) provide primary exposure to public equity markets together with Large Cap Core.

Sands Capital Management invests in earlier-stage companies that are experiencing rapid growth through superior products or services;
Harding Loevner invests in emerging market companies with a sustainable competitive advantage and superior returns on invested capital that are trading at a reasonable price; and
Bessemer Managed Volatility Equities is a quantitative lower volatility strategy which narrows down the global equity universe to find companies that are attractive based on valuation, management quality, and company-specific risk.


                     A team of Bessemer professionals maintains overall responsibility, manages a portion of the assets, and oversees the external sub-advisers.

LinkedIn



LinkedIn operates the world's largest professional network.  Started from a living room in 2002, the site officially launched on May 5, 2003.  After a month in business, it counted 4,500 members in the network.

Yelp



Yelp was founded in San Francisco in July 2004 to connect people to great local businesses. We became Yelp's first institutional investor in 2005. Shortly after our investment, Yelp's team of about a dozen people moved into a shuttered stereo store on San Francisco's Mission street. The location had an unexpected upside: Yelp board meetings took place in a padded room once used to demo loud set ups, which ensured that those confidential conversations would not be overheard. Today, that seems like ancient history. Yelp went public in 2012 (NYSE: YELP) and now has active communities in 32 countries around the world.  With more than 90 million rich, local reviews, Yelp is the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists.

OvaScience, Inc. 



OvaScience makes miracles happen. Founded in 2011, with the goal of improving the treatment of infertility, the company assembled a team of scientists, physicians and advisers that are recognized leaders in the field of reproductive medicine. In 2015, baby Zain Rajani was born.  Zain was the first baby born with the assistance of OvaScience's first product (AUGMENT) which increases the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and uses the mothers own cellular energy to revitalize her egg.  For Bessemer, backing the OvaScience founders in 2011 was an easy decision.   We’d funded Michelle Dipp, Christoph Westphal, and Rich Aldrich before.  (In fact, we’ve funded Christoph five times!)  OvaScience (NASDAQ: OVAS) became a public company in 2012.

Periscope 



Periscope changed how we see the world.  Periscope is a live video streaming app developed by Kayvon Beykpour and Joe Bernstein.  The idea for Periscope was born in 2013, as Kayvon traveled abroad. He was in Istanbul when protests broke out in Taksim Square. He turned to Twitter for real-time updates but, while he could read about the protests, he was frustrated not to see them. Motivated by that experience, Kayvon and Joe started the company in February 2014.  Two months later, we provided seed capital to fund development of the app. Before launching their product, Periscope was acquired by Twitter (January 2015).   Periscope was launched in March 2015 and now has over 10 million registered users and 40 years of video watched per day.

Bessemer Trust Co. has raised $161 million of its estimated $250 million goal for Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XII, its latest fund of funds, according to filings with regulators. The firm is well known for managing money for wealthy families.
The new fund would be a successor to Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XI, which had a target of $200 million. That fund had drawn commitments of $154 million as of June, 2011, according to the latest regulatory filing available. Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XI’s first Form D was filed on Sept. 23, 2010.
Bessemer Trust has been launching Old Westbury funds-of-funds for several years, and over the years has made commitments to the $21.7 billion Blackstone Capital Partners V fund, the $5.3 billion Bain Capital Fund VIII and the $10 billion Apollo Investment Fund VI, among other buyout funds, according to the Dow Jones Directory of Alternative Investment Programs. 





Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XII’s May 28 Form D filing lists the fund’s first sale date as April 15, 2013. The firm says it does not intend the offering to last more than a year. The minimum investment accepted from any outside investor is $250,000.
Gregory Lester, Daniel Rice, Daphne Richards, Marc de Saint Phalle and Philip Benyola are listed as officers of Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XII. Everett Goings and Mark Hansen are also included as officers of the fund and members of the issuer’s board of managers. However, their names did not appear in an earlier Form D filing for Fund XII on April 23.
Both the May 28 and April 23 Form D filings listed $161 million raised thus far for Old Westbury Private Equity Fund XII, just a few months after a Dec. 4, 2012 filing that disclosed zero money raised for the fund.
A spokesperson from New York-based Bessemer Trust Co. declined to comment.
Privately-owned Bessemer Trust’s web site lists $88.2 billion under supervision.  Founded in 1907, the firm now counts more than 2,100 clients and 700 employees under CEO Marc Stern, President George Wilcox and CIO Rebecca Patterson.
The firm has a fund-of-funds investment program focused on “attractive long-term capital appreciation” through venture capital and later-stage private equity funds throughout the world, according to its web site. Its objective is to “deliver a return pattern not highly correlated with public markets.”

Bessemer has offices in Silicon Valley, as well as New York; Mumbai; Herzliya, Israel; and Cambridge, Mass.

PRESS RELEASE:
Bessemer Venture Partners (BVP), a global investment firm, today announced the closing of Bessemer Venture Partners VIII. BVP VIII is a $1.6 billion venture capital fund that will sustain the firm’s focus on investing in and partnering with innovative, high-growth companies across multiple industries and geographies. Alongside existing BVP limited partners, Bessemer welcomed a select number of leading university endowments, corporations and family offices into BVP VIII as new LPs.
“With BVP VIII, we continue our mission of finding and funding the highest growth startups, wherever they operate,” said BVP partner Ed Colloton. “And we have clearly benefited from an on-the-ground presence in a number of key markets to identify the most talented entrepreneurs. Bessemer is among the first venture capital firms to have built a truly global platform.”
Bessemer, which actively invests in North America, India, Israel, Europe and Latin America, expects to invest roughly a quarter of the new fund in the fast-growing Indian market. BVP opened its offices in Mumbai seven years ago and has since invested in 31 Indian companies, including Shriram EPC, Orient Green Power, IL&FS Transportation Networks and Applied Solar Technologies. As in other markets where BVP is investing, BVP’s India strategy has been to select great entrepreneurs and actively help them build enduring businesses. 





Since raising BVP VII in 2007, Bessemer has continued to add talented partners globally, including Steve Kraus in Cambridge, Mass.; Umesh Padval in Menlo Park; and Vishal Gupta, Siddharth Nautiyal and Subramanya “Subu” S.V. in Mumbai.
Bessemer is one of the oldest venture capital firms in the U.S., growing out of steel magnate Henry Phipps’ family holding company, Bessemer Securities, which was founded in 1911 and is still an anchor investor in BVP VIII.
Throughout its history, BVP has backed some of the world’s most talented early stage entrepreneurs, helping them to build their businesses and dominate growing markets. In the last three years, BVP has realized 27 portfolio-company exits, including initial public offerings for BroadSoft, Orient Green Power and Cornerstone OnDemand and M&A exits for Quidsi (sold to Amazon.com), Playdom (Disney), Alnara (Eli Lilly) and Vertica (Hewlett-Packard).
About Bessemer Venture Partners
Bessemer Venture Partners is a global venture capital firm with offices in Silicon Valley, Cambridge, Mass., New York, Mumbai and Herzliya, Israel. One of the oldest venture capital practices in the United States, BVP has partnered as an active, hands-on investor in Ciena, LinkedIn, Celtel, Blue Nile, Skype, Staples, VeriSign and Yelp. More than 100 BVP-funded companies have gone public on exchanges in Canada, India, the U.K. and the United States. Learn more at www.bvp.com and www.bvp.com/india.

Mutual funds can help lower investing risks
Take some of the anxiety out of investing by letting a mutual fund do a little of the work for you.

Browse Vanguard funds by asset class


Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

Vanguard balanced funds


100% of our low-cost balanced funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Get a mix of stocks and bonds in one fund
Combine the potential for income and growth



Balanced mutual funds invest in both bonds, which focus primarily on income, and stocks, which aim for investment growth.

Add stability to your portfolio



The bond portion of the fund helps offset the risks associated with the stock portion—providing you with a "balanced" investment.

Automatically maintain your asset mix



You never have to rebalance a balanced fund—it's done for you automatically. Some funds maintain a set asset mix, while others grow more conservative over time.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds and stocks in a single balanced fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds and stocks.

How to choose a balanced fund



Picking a Vanguard balanced fund generally depends on whether you're investing for a specific goal, like retirement, or you have another goal in mind.

Target Retirement Funds



If you're investing for retirement, you can get a complete portfolio in a single fund with a Vanguard Target Retirement Fund. Simply choose a fund based on the date you plan to retire or your current age, and the fund will gradually grow more conservative the closer you get to retirement.
See which Target Retirement Fund fits your timeline


LifeStrategy Funds



If you'd prefer a fund that maintains a set asset mix, a LifeStrategy® Fund can help you reach other financial goals.
Match your risk tolerance to a LifeStrategy Fund


Managed Payout Fund



If you're looking to generate income in retirement, Vanguard Managed Payout Fund** might be appropriate for you.
Get income from the Managed Payout Fund


Traditional balanced funds



If you'd like a set asset allocation based on the level of risk you're comfortable with, choose from a variety of traditional index or actively managed balanced funds.

footnote**Vanguard Managed Payout Fund is protected by U.S. Patent Nos. 8,180,695 and 8,185,464.
	Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments to more conservative ones based on its target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
	Each LifeStrategy Fund invests in 4 broadly diversified Vanguard funds and is subject to the risks associated with those underlying funds.
	The Managed Payout Fund is not guaranteed to achieve its investment objectives, is subject to loss, and some of its distributions may be treated in part as a return of capital. The dollar amount of the fund's monthly cash distributions could go up or down substantially from one year to the next and over time. It is also possible for the fund to suffer substantial investment losses and simultaneously experience additional asset reductions as a result of its distributions to shareholders under its managed-distribution policy. An investment in the fund could lose money over short, intermediate, or even long periods of time because the fund allocates its assets worldwide across different asset classes and investments with specific risk and return characteristics. Diversification does not necessarily ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. The fund is proportionately subject to the risks associated with its underlying funds, which may invest in stocks (including stocks issued by REITs), bonds, cash, inflation-linked investments, commodity-linked investments, long/short market-neutral investments, and leveraged absolute return investments.
	The Managed Payout Fund may not be appropriate for all investors. For example, depending on the time horizon, retirement income needs, and tax bracket, an investment in the Managed Payout Fund might not be appropriate for younger investors not currently in retirement, in IRAs or other tax-advantaged accounts for those investors under 59½, or for participants in employer-sponsored plans. Investors who hold the Managed Payout Fund within a tax-advantaged retirement account should consult their tax advisors to discuss tax consequences that could result if payments are distributed from their core account prior to age 59½ or if they plan to use the Managed Payout Fund, in whole or in part, to meet their required minimum distribution (RMD) obligations. Distributions from the Managed Payout Fund are unlikely to precisely match an investor's IRA RMD obligations. In addition, use of the Managed Payout Fund may be restricted in employer-sponsored plans by the terms of the governing plan documents and/or at the discretion of the plan administrator. Review the information carefully with your financial advisor before deciding whether the Managed Payout Fund is right for you.
	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.

Index funds could help lower long-term costs
Get the high quality and low costs you'd expect from the company that introduced indexing to individual investors.
What are index mutual funds?



Instead of hiring fund managers to actively select which stocks or bonds the fund will hold, an index fund buys all (or a representative sample) of the securities in a specific index, like the S&P 500 Index.The goal of an index fund is to track the performance of a specific market benchmark as closely as possible. That's why you may hear it referred to as a "passively managed" fund.

Index funds offer built-in benefits








Low costs
Because index funds hold investments until the index itself changes, they generally have lower management and transaction costs.
 




Lower risk through broader diversification
Some index funds give you exposure to potentially thousands of securities in a single fund.
 




Tax efficiency
Broad index funds generally don't trade as much as actively managed funds might, so they're typically generating less taxable income, which reduces the drag on your investments.
 
Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds 

Could actively managed funds help you beat the market?

Read more about what you should consider when choosing an index fund


You can get an index fund anywhere—why Vanguard?








We started the indexing revolution
Vanguard launched the first index fund for individual investors in 1976, and we've been fine-tuning both our benchmark selections and tracking skills ever since.Today, we have more than 60 unique funds that track indexes across the bond and stock markets, both U.S. and international, as well as sector-specific areas of the markets.
See a complete list of Vanguard index funds 

 




We've made it our business to keep your costs low
The average Vanguard index fund expense ratio is 71% less than the industry average.*

Low-cost investing for everyone



Our passion for low costs will always be our driving force. When others take notice, expense ratios fall more broadly. Everyone wins!

How would index funds fit into your portfolio?



Because of their low costs, broader diversification, and tax efficiency, index funds could be appropriate for any portion of your portfolio. In fact, the right balance of four of our broadest index funds could give you a complete portfolio, with full exposure to U.S. and international stock and bond markets.Get details on:

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. Bond funds are subject to the risk that an issuer will fail to make payments on time and that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates or negative perceptions of an issuer's ability to make payments. Investments in stocks issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk, which is the chance that political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions; and currency risk, which is the chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates. Funds that concentrate on a relatively narrow market sector face the risk of higher share-price volatility. Past performance is no guarantee of future returns. The performance of an index is not an exact representation of any particular investment, as you cannot invest directly in an index.

Past performance cannot be used to predict future returns. Fund share prices will fluctuate, so investors could lose money if they sell when prices have fallen.
You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through a broker like Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (you may incur commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares aren't redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Like stocks, ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you'll pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning

By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
