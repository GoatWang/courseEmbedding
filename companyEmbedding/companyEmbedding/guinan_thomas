As long as they do carry this insurance, you cannot sue your employer if they cause your injury. Frequently, however, there are third parties who through their negligence caused your work-related injury and we at Howland Hess will advise you of your rights and opportunities for appropriate compensation.Wrongful TerminationA short list of the types of claims range from real estate, zoning, eminent domain, business agreements, shareholders agreements, employment, wrongful termination, corporate, breach of contracts, mechanics liens.Property LawProperty DamageLimited tort option. While a much more cost effective option, limited tort significantly restrains those insured under such a policy to sue for anything other than economic damages (unpaid medical bills, lost wages/earnings, and property damage). What does this mean? That electing limited tort does not eliminate your right to bring a lawsuit against an at-fault driver, but it does potentially limit your recovery options.Real Estate LitigationOur attorneys also have a depth of experience in all aspects of real estate disputes. We have represented our clients for a century in matters involving breach of contract or other Agreement of Sale disputes, fraudulent misrepresentation, failure to disclose, serious termite damage, adequacy of water supply, operation of on-site septic system, specific performance, violation or enforcement of Deed restrictions or restrictive covenants, easements, boundaries, rights-of-way, private streets, paper streets, and almost any other imaginable area of real estate disputes. One of our most fulfilling areas of practice is helping land owners obtain just compensation when their land is taken by the government in condemnation proceedings.Premises LiabilityRepresentation includes claims involving motor vehicle accidents, accidents involving catastrophic injuries, product liability, wrongful death claims, slip and fall and other premises liability actions.Construction LitigationHaving represented clients in every category of construction, Howland Hess has successfully resolved disputes at all levels of complexity arising from a wide range of construction projects, from moderately sized projects to mega-projects in both the public and private sectors. The firm has particular expertise in projects such as schools, government buildings, highways and other private projects and residential communities. The firm represents major contractors, owners, design professionals, subcontractors, material suppliers, vendors, sureties and other construction industry participants with matters throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Representations include prosecuting and defending construction claims for delay, disruption and acceleration of work, extra work and change order disputes, bid disputes, surety law matters including payment and performance bond claims, mechanics' lien claims, OSHA claims and project safety matters, claims for defective work and related construction law matters.Real Estate TransactionsIn addition to all forms of real estate transactions, 1031 exchanges, and real estate litigation, our practice is also concentrated in all aspects of zoning, subdivision and land development. We assist our clients in evaluating the best approach to obtaining desired or necessary special exceptions, variances, or conditional uses, and we will guide the matter through the approval process by meeting with the applicable public officials, and representing the client before the necessary Municipal body, including the Commissioners, Supervisors, Planning Commission, Historic Review Board and Zoning Hearing Board. Similar to our varied legal practice in the area of real estate transactions, our clients range from homeowners who simply want a side or rear yard variance to permit the construction of an addition or a swimming pool to complicated use variances to permit new business uses or to establish the legality of an existing non-conforming use. We also handle minor subdivisions involving the split off of a single building lot from an existing oversized residential property, and complex subdivision for large residential new home developments or other projects.Eminent DomainEasementLand Use and ZoningGeorge has an extensive background in estate administration, estate planning and taxation, real estate, zoning and land use. George, a 35 year partner at Barbin & O'Connell, prior to its merger with Howland Hess, is committed to the community and has continuously served pro bono on the Montgomery County Legal Aid Society since 1971, has been a Director and Solicitor for the Elkins Park Fire Company and the Cheltenham High School Alumni Association for in excess of thirty-five years, is a representative of the Cheltenham Township Fire Department and has served with Abington Township's Citizens and Police Together (CAPT).

None of the penalties listed are guaranteed as maximum or minimum penalties.Wrongful DeathHowland Hess undertakes a wide range of personal injury issues for its clients, including motor vehicle accidents, accidents involving catastrophic injuries, product liability, wrongful death claims, slip and fall and other premises liability actions. We are committed to ensuring that victims of accidents receive fair compensation. We recommend that you contact a physician and an attorney following an accident, because seemingly minor accidents can cause prolonged pain and medical costs. Our skilled legal team will gather, prepare and present the evidence that is critical to successfully resolving your claim.Traffic ViolationsIn order to curb this unnecessary loss of life, Pennsylvania State Troopers will be confronting the issue of speeding motorists in work zones in a new manner. According to the commander of the Pennsylvania State Police Troop charged with Turnpike patrols, Captain Gregory Bacher, troopers will be dispatchedMisdemeanors$500.00 - $5,000.00 fine, 10 days to 2 years prison sentence, license suspension for one year, an official charge of a 2nd degree misdemeanor on your criminal record, alcohol and drug counseling/treatment, pay for installation and utilize ignition interlock system in vehicle for one year, higher insurance rates.Drug CrimesHowland Hess is experienced in defending a wide range of criminal matters including DUI/DWI, drug offenses, assaults, and juvenile criminal violations.

Parents need to be able to meet the many needs of their children. In many divorce cases or separations, the non-custodial parent (the parent that does not live with the children) provides financial support to the custodial parent (the parent that lives with the children).Child Custody and VisitationChild custody issues tend to be the most heart-wrenching and problematic part of a divorce or separation. In all cases, the Court will operate with “the best interests of the children” in mind. Keeping this objective in the forefront, most families end up with a custody order reached by agreement. Those that cannot agree receive an order imposed by the court.GuardianshipOur goal is to plan ahead for those things you may have never thought to prepare for. The focus of this firm is to care for the needs of families and individuals as they age. As listed above, issues accompanying aging include senior housing and homecare, long-term care, guardianships, health documents, Medicare and Medicaid.Spousal SupportSpousal Support is a payment one spouse makes to another while the parties are separated. Alimony is the financial support that one may receive after a divorce if they are the financially dependent spouse. The experienced family law attorneys at Howland, Hess, Guinan, Torpey, Cassidy & O’Connell can assist you with your spousal support and alimony matters. They will help you to understand the process of determining the amount of support, whether a mortgage deviation will apply, and the length of time that one spouse may collect an award. Much like child support, the calculations are based upon the incomes of both parties.AnnulmentFor many married individuals in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the pathway to legally ending a marriage is through divorce. However, that’s not the only way. In addition to divorce, a marriage in Pennsylvania can also be dissolved through what is known as an annulment. This is a term which many are familiar with, but few actually understand.Trusts and EstatesProbateEstate PlanningMr. Benz is an experienced estate planner and litigator with broad range of legal experience.
