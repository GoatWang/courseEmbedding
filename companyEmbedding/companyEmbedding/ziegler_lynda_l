Itron Announces Election Of Lynda Ziegler To Vice Chairman Of The Board Of Directors






Business Wire




Feb 26, 2015 4:30 PM EST













 




























































  Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITRI), a world-leading technology and services company dedicated to the resourceful use of energy and water, announced today that its board of directors has elected Lynda L. Ziegler to the new role of vice chairman of the board of directors, effective April 1, 2015. The vice chairman position was created as a part of the board's succession planning process to ensure the seamless transition of responsibilities when the current chairman's term concludes.  Ziegler has been an independent member of the Itron board since February 2013. She brings extensive experience in the energy industry to the board. In September 2012, she retired from Southern California Edison (SCE), one of the largest electric utilities in the U.S. and part of Edison International. Ziegler was responsible for the successful automation of nearly 5 million meters and associated supporting systems as a part of SCE's Edison SmartConnect ® program.  "It has been an honor to work with Lynda since she joined the board two years ago, and I look forward to working even more closely with her during the next year," said Jon Eliassen, chairman of Itron's board of directors. "Lynda's extensive business and industry experience makes her well-qualified to take on the new role of vice chairman. The board will be in good hands when my tenure as chairman ends in May 2016."  "Itron has benefited greatly from Lynda's utility industry expertise and her experience as a pioneer in grid modernization," said Philip Mezey, Itron president and chief executive officer. "I am pleased that Itron and our customers will continue to benefit from Lynda's valuable insights as we work toward creating a more resourceful world."  Forward-Looking Statements:  This release contains forward-looking statements concerning our expectations about operations, financial performance, sales, earnings and cash flows. These statements reflect our current plans and expectations and are based on information currently available. The statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate, and which are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated. Risks and uncertainties include the rate and timing of customer demand for our products, rescheduling of current customer orders, changes in estimated liabilities for product warranties, changes in laws and regulations, our dependence on new product development and intellectual property, future acquisitions, changes in estimates for stock-based and bonus compensation, increasing volatility in foreign exchange rates, international business risks and other factors that are more fully described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 and other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Itron undertakes no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements, including our business outlook.
