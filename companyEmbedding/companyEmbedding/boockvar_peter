July 26, 2017 By Peter Boockvar The FOMC: Relatively Soon
The FOMC statement is basically setting the stage for a September beginning to QT. The wording was this: “The Committee expects to begin implementing its balance sheet normalization program relatively soon, provided that the economy evolves broadly as anticipated.” The emphasis is certainly mine and “Relatively Soon” is exactly what Yellen said in her Congressional … [Read more...] about The FOMC: Relatively SoonJuly 26, 2017 By Peter Boockvar Another Good Auction
5 Year Auction
After a solid 2 yr note auction yesterday, today’s 5 yr auction was good too. The yield of 1.884% was a touch below the when issued of about 1.89%. The bid to cover of 2.58 was the above the 12 month average of 2.44. Also reflecting healthy demand was the combined direct and indirect bidders took 76% of the auction, thus leaving dealers with just 24%. … [Read more...] about Another Good AuctionJuly 26, 2017 By Peter Boockvar Home sales in June uneventful
New Home Sales
New home sales in June came in at 610k annualized, about in line with the estimate of 615k vs 605k in May which was revised down by 5k. For comparison, the 3 month average is now at 603k vs the 6 month run rate of 607k and vs 561k in 2016. We are though still running 15% below the 15 year average where the bubble peak was 1.389mm in July 2005.

United States
With plenty of hints that QT from the Fed comes before another rate hike, the only question today is whether the groundwork is laid in the statement for a beginning of this process in September or do they rely on upcoming speeches to set the stage. As the September meeting is not until the 19th/20th, they do have some time but considering that Yellen … [Read more...] about Now it’s all about when QT starts / Sentiment extreme again / OtherJuly 25, 2017 By Peter Boockvar 2 yr note auction very good. What’s that say?
The 2 yr note auction was very good. The yield of 1.395% was below the when issued of about 1.40%. The bid to cover of 3.06 was well above the 12 month average of 2.73 and was the most since an auction in November 2015. Also reflecting solid demand, direct and indirect bidders took about 75% of the auction leaving dealers with only 25%, well below the one year average … [Read more...] about 2 yr note auction very good.

The July Conference Board Consumer Confidence index rose to 121.1 from a revised 117.3 in June. That was almost 5 pts above the estimate of 116.5. This is the 2nd best level post election with the 124.9 print in March being the best with both levels last seen in 2000. It was at 100.8 in October.

As FOMC members have recently expressed some reservations with valuations in some asset classes such as commercial real estate, I’d add this to yesterday’s list of things I would bring into a Fed meeting if I were a staffer.

Markit’s manufacturing and services composite index for July rose .3 pts to 54.2 led by a m/o/m gain of 1.2 pts in manufacturing. The services component was unchanged at 54.2.

 Educational Background



 


The George Washington University

                  The George Washington University actively engages Washington, D.C., and the world. Their location in the heart of Washington places them at the core of U.S. government, policy and law. They sit where the worlds of science, technology, media and the arts converge. Their students and faculty have the unparalleled opportunity to study and work alongside leaders and practitioners in every discipline, to take part in the interchanges that shape our community and the world.
The George Washington University was created in 1821 through an Act of Congress, fulfilling George Washington’s vision of an institution in the nation’s capital dedicated to educating and preparing future leaders.
Today, GW is the largest institution of higher education in the District of Columbia. They have more than 20,000 students—from all 50 states, the District and more than 130 countries—studying a rich range of disciplines: from forensic science and creative writing to international affairs and computer engineering, as well as medicine, public health, the law and public policy.
GW comprises three campuses—Foggy Bottom and Mount Vernon in Washington, D.C., and the GW Virginia Science and Technology Campus in Ashburn, Va.—as well as several graduate education centers in the metropolitan area and Hampton Roads, Va.

  Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve…            The Reformed Broker    Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve…Posted December 15, 2014 by Joshua M Brown  Peter has something to get off his chest. Posted in full with his permission, an open letter to the Fed. Hope you enjoy! – JB***Dear Federal Reserve:As we approach your last get together of the year I first want to wish you all great holidays and a happy and healthy new year. I also want to extend my utmost respect for the time you have given to public service in your contribution of what is the Federal Reserve system with the best intentions. But, as they say with the best intentions, it leads to roads unforeseen to put it nice. As it is year end it’s always a good time for reflection and let’s look in the mirror together.The predominant investing rallying cry over the last 15+ years of the ‘Greenspan (now Fed) put’ and ‘search for yield’ without regard to risk is again showing its darker side, this time in the energy patch. We of course saw it first in technology land in the late 1990’s, to be repeated in a different fashion in the mid 2000’s via credit and housing and now in the US oil and gas industry. Thanks to those two sayings, the US economy has become the US ‘boom and bust’ economy. Your sole focus on consumer price inflation has again shifted your attention from the negative repercussions of excessive asset price inflation that inevitably always mean reverts. This time, an epic bond bubble is showing some big time cracks in corporate land.Without rehashing the two previous bubbles, let’s talk about the new one and focus on the ‘search for yield’ without regard to risk syndrome that again created extreme asset price inflation and again got hold of parts of our economy. Via another one of your cycles of interest rates well below the rate of inflation, the manhandling of longer term interest rates with QE and amazing American ingenuity and technology, anyone with a drill bit and a land lease was able to get a loan as long as oil prices levitated north of $80. Bloomberg estimates that since early 2010, $550b loans and bonds were issued by the oil and gas industry. Give me yield or give me death was essentially the mantra for this and many other investments. And, the money kept flowing, the drilling kept coming and all of a sudden the spurt in supply bumped up against a slowing global economy and then poof. The bubble burst essentially in a crash with crude prices falling by 46% over the past 6 months, not coincidentally either just as QE was ending.Which brings us to another one of your meetings this week where the debate now and for 2015 is when and how do you normalize interest rates and whether your focus should be the better labor market and the improvement in wage gains in November or more so the sudden drop in commodity prices mostly driven by lower oil prices. The irony of this discussion though hopefully won’t escape you. Cheap money that you created fueled a drilling boom that oversupplied a market that now has shrinking demand. Now with lower oil prices, headline inflation and inflation expectations as a result, you may actually use low inflation as an excuse to keep rates low for longer, the same policy that previously created the boom and now the bust. In your desire for higher inflation, cheap money instead lead to malinvestment and over capacity that inevitably lead to a downside and lower prices.Those fiber optic cables would have been laid anyway, those homes would have been built anyway and those shale wells would have been drilled anyway but the ‘Fed put’ and ‘search for yield’ rallying cries brought so much of this activity together at once in their respective time periods that the boom it created inevitably lead to the busts that followed. You know excessively easy monetary policy not only buys time, it steals economic activity from the future. Buy and invest today maybe what you would have done tomorrow but tomorrow always comes. Why isn’t this lesson ever learned?I will sum up with this: history is replete with the bad economic consequences of trying to manipulate human behavior with government induced price controls. Over the last 15 years especially it’s been control over the price of money and current policy is as if we have an economic five alarm fire. I’m not calling for you to quickly normalize policy immediately. I just believe that the process must begin, however slowly, as soon as possible and asset price inflation should no longer be ignored or only acknowledged with vague comments about overvaluation in select asset markets. Words and macro prudential regulation are not going to do it. The path ahead will be disruptive but that can no longer be avoided as 6 years of ZIRP and a 5 fold increase in your balance sheet has already way overstayed its welcome. The longer you wait, the worse the consequences will be when you do. Again, happy holidays and happy 2015.Sincerely yours,Peter Boockvar Managing Director and Chief Market Analyst, The Lindsey Group LLC Now go talk about it.       facebook        twitter        linkedin What's been said: Discussions found on the web      dashofinsight tweeted on Dec 15 Equal time for a source consistently wrong on the Fed RT @ReformedBroker: Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… http://t.co/m7oUoouWHe       johnkay999 tweeted on Dec 16 Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… http://t.co/pMRqumsZkN       Furlicity tweeted on Dec 16 Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… by @ReformedBroker http://t.co/E10NqXYhgT       sobata416 tweeted on Dec 16 $$$Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve:http://t.co/iIMpzzGkM1       GreenMonsterah tweeted on Dec 16 “@sobata416: $$$Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve:http://t.co/vV3hnIJz2E” good read Ty #oil #shalebubble Ty #Fed #QE      Tuesday Morning Links | timiacono.com commented on Dec 16 […] Dick Bove: Fed ‘Forcing Bank Transactions Into Shadow Market’ – MoneyNews Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… – Reformed Broker Industrial Production, Russia – Fed […]       hap317 tweeted on Dec 16 Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… http://t.co/kpHOShBwe3       BrennanMHopper tweeted on Dec 16 The rally cry over Fed put & search for yield without regard to risk is showing its darker side,this time in energy. http://t.co/oi813BaFKD      Peter Boockvar Writes the Stupidest Article Ever? | greyenlightenment.com commented on Dec 16 […] This plea to the fed to end QE is so stupid it necessitates a response: Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve […]       Notiflux tweeted on Dec 16 peter boockvar: dear federal reserve… http://t.co/5Dtv4HLXMz       MoneyDiva_ tweeted on Dec 16 Boom&Bust “…excessively easy monetary policy not only buys time, it steals economic activity from the future.” http://t.co/JoxwcAxUit       rizzello700 tweeted on Dec 17 Peter Boockvar: Dear Federal Reserve… http://t.co/Ml4xPIF3HF  Read this next.October 6, 2015 What Oil Does to Profit MarginsJanuary 8, 2010 Cold Snap Gets Oil Services Sector Off To A Great Start in 2010April 29, 2013 Five reasons I’m not worried about a Canadian housing bubble @reformedbrokerJoshua M.

Peter Boockvar: The Fed Has Overdosed on Social JusticeFergus Hodgson, 22 September 2016   DOWNLOAD THE MP3The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee has chosen to resist raising the federal-funds rate, the base interest rate in the U.S. economy. Peter Boockvar delivers the skinny on how these decisions are always influenced by politics, and why a corrective recession is inevitable and will only worsen with time.Boockvar is managing director and chief market analyst for the Lindsey Group LLC and co-chief investment officer for Bookmark Advisors, and he is building his own blog-style publication, the Boock Report. In particular, he makes the case that Fed officials should not be relied on for market savvy: "They only, obviously, discover[bubbles] after they have popped."Further, he says that the political inclination of those at the helm of the Fed is contrary to any Paul Volcker-style tightening: "[Yellen] believes in social justice.… These are all political animals who don't want to be blamed for a recession.… That's the problem.… You have to have somebody who … has a longer-term perspective."Boockvar, who will speak at the upcoming New Orleans Investment Conference (October 26-29), is also a CNBC contributor, so you can also watch a clip of him from this morning.Recommended LinksFederal Reserve System monetary-policy press release, September 21, 2016."The Canary in the 35-Year Bond Bull Market Is Singing," by Peter Boockvar with CNBC."Japan's Lost Decade: The Dangers of Deficit Spending," by Fergus Hodgson in the Cleveland Plain Dealer."What Is Social Justice?" by Jonah Goldberg of the American Enterprise Institute.Fergus Hodgson (@FergHodgson) is an economic consultant and Gold Newsletter's digital-media director.Subscribe Now
