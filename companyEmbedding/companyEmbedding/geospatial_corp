GEOUNDERGROUNDACCESS YOUR DATA ANYWHERE, ANY TIME




UNDERGROUND INFRASTRUCTURE MAPPING & DATA ACQUISITION: THE PLAN  PROJECT PLANNINGSaves time and leads to faster results. Existing records are acquired to identify an approximate location, ascertain the materials used to construct the lines and improve the overall organization and productivity of locating team. SEEKING WHAT'S BELOWGeospatial provides the right team with the right technologies to provide the right results to our clients-every time. COMBINING TECHNOLOGYGeospatial's ability to combine several data acquisition technologies enables us to provide the right solution to our clients infrastructure management issues. 

Additional Services

  Geospatial's Smart Probe, Gyroscopic (In-Line) Mapping System Geospatial's Smart Probe, Gyroscopic (In-Line) Mapping System allows the Company to map various types of conduits and pipelines from 3.8 cm (1.5 inches) to 122 cm (48 inches) in diameter. Pipelines or conduits can be of any material, metallic or non-metallic and can be located at any depth. Since the Smart Probe does not communicate with the surface, this is also an economical solution for mapping under bodies of water or under large pieces of equipment as the Smart Probe does not require a data tether or any communication with the surface, (such as a sonde).      Geospatial's Smart Probe Freedom II EM Pipeline Mapping Technologies Geospatial’s Smart Probe Freedom II electromagnetic mapping system provides efficient underground pipeline mapping with centimeter accuracy in x,y&z, providing accurate 3D positional data along with top of grade and depth of cover data to within 10 cm (4 inches). There is no need to enter the pipeline and this technology is not affected by soil conditions.The Smart Probe Freedom II Electromagnetic Pipeline Mapping Technology employs a set of magnetic field sensors to accurately measure the 3-D vector from our sensors to an underground utility and automatically combines this vector with absolute positions obtained via GNSS or other survey methods to obtain the 3-D coordinates of the utility. The Probes novel approach allows it to measure the 3-D vector from any vantage point within range and its built-in acceleration and magnetic sensors allow it to operate in almost any position. Moreover, it offers two distinct operating modes, line and sonde, extending its capabilities to most surveying situations.With this system Geospatial has the ability to map most pipelines up to 50 feet (15 meters) in depth. We are capable of mapping both metallic and non-metallic pipelines such as HDPE, PVC or other composites. To map non-metallic pipelines, a detectable rodder must be inserted into the conduit. Our Smart Probe Freedom II EM Mapping System accurately maps underground cables as well as pipelines as small as 1” in diameter. Adaptations of our Smart Probe Freedom II EM Pipeline Mapping Technologies allow Geospatial to collect data with our sensors mounted to an All Terrain Vehicle (ATV) allowing accurate and efficient data collection over a long distance. All data from this system seamless downloads via the web into our GeoUnderground data management system or any standard GIS system.    Geospatial's Smart Stack Combined Infrared, LIDAR & Microwave Technologies Geospatial’s Smart Stack™ Combined LIDAR, Infrared & Microwave Technologies was developed to locate underground pipelines and to detect voids and leaks in various underground pipelines including oil, gas, water and most other materials.Our Smart Stack™ sensors can be deployed on a walking device, on a van or ground-based vehicle or (ATV) All-Terrain Vehicle. It can also be deployed via a helicopter, fixed-wing aircraft or (UAV) un-manned aerial vehicle.This unique arrangement or “stack” of sensors and technologies allows Geospatial to collect accurate 2D pipeline locational information over large areas of ground very efficiently and economically.  Geospatial’s Smart Stack Sensors™ have the ability to map pipelines made from any type of material, (metallic and non-metallic). Our sensors can locate pipelines to depths in excess of 5 meters (15 feet). When combined with Geospatial’s “ground-truthing” capabilities, that utilize a number of our technologies, we can combine highly accurate (10 cm or 4 inch) x,y&z co-ordinates to the data derived from our Smart Stack™ technologies creating a true 3D picture of the underground infrastructure covering a very large geographical area.  In addition to accurate 2D or 3D pipeline mapping capabilities, Geospatial’s Smart Stack Technologies™ provide our clients highly detailed geo-referenced leak detection data over the entire area mapped with our Smart Stack™ system.      Geospatial's Smart Probe Immersion Our Smart Probe Immersion underwater mapping system enables Geospatial to accurately and efficiently map underwater pipelines and conduits of all sizes and types down to depths as much as 180 feet (55 meters) from the surface. In most cases, there is no requirement to enter the pipeline, enabling you to keep your system in service throughout the mapping process. Depending upon site conditions and length of run, accessible underwater pipelines can also be effectively mapped utilizing Geospatial's Smart Probe Freedom II system. All data from each of Geospatial's underwater mapping technologies seamlessly integrates with the Company's GeoUnderground GIS portal.    Electromagnetic (EM) Locating Technologies Electromagnetic underground infrastructure location and mapping technologies come in various configurations and capabilities. This technology will locate all metallic lines, including electrical instrumentation, CATV, telephone, steel or ductile iron pipes, and non-pressurized and some pressurized systems where a detectable rodder can be placed inside.  Lines may be traced by direct connection to the line or by induction, which is placing a transmitter above the expected path of the utility.  The EM equipment consists of a transmitter and receiver.  The transmitter applies a signal, set to a specific frequency, to a utility line or any insulated metallic line.  The transmitted signal is picked up by the receiver, which is tuned to the same frequency.  EM equipment has a selection of frequency and power setting options.  The choice of active frequency and power settings is dependent on site and line conditions.  In addition to the active frequencies, the receivers are equipped to scan for passive 60Hz power and broad-spectrum radio frequencies.     Conventional Electromagnetic Locating Technologies Conventional electromagnetic locating technologies consist of a hand-held receiver combined with an EM transmitter with a signal either applied to a line or induced via the soils.  By walking along the path of the utility following the resultant signal, the technician can determine the position of the pipeline or conduit and proceed to follow and record the position of the line in the x&y position and roughly the (z) or depth at the position of each particular reading.    Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Conventional ground penetrating radar will locate metallic and non-metallic lines provided that the soil conditions are suitable. The GPR unit is limited by the soil conditions at the site and the diameter of the utility lines or conduits. The GPR equipment sends continuous electromagnetic pulses through the earth or other structures, receives the reflected waves back from subsurface structures, and displays the results to construct a “picture” of the subsurface structures.  In some instances, GPR can be useful identifying potential targets even if the utility is not visible, for example identifying an underlying trench line.      Vacuum Excavation In many cases, vacuum excavation may be used if it is necessary to positively identify a buried waterline and confirm its depth.  This is the only approved mechanical means to safely expose buried utilities.    GeoUnderground-GPS Mapping/GIS Database Geospatial Corporation has developed GeoUnderground; a light weight, secure, and feature-rich web-based GIS management portal to provide a suite of tools to make critical data available to the customer in a comprehensive and user-friendly platform.GeoUnderground is a software-as-service "SAAS" model developed exclusively for web-based multi-users who have a need to manage and easily access critical infrastructure data.  Offering a variety of powerful data management tools, GeoUnderground incorporates geographic information system "GIS" functionality and web services that  can be used to supplement or even replace enterprise IT environments.  Industries that use GeoUnderground will be provided with two key benefits; their data is stored and accessible to authorized users via a secure centralized data repository, and it is delivered to them in an easy to use interface through their existing web browser.

GeoUnderground is custom designed around the Google Maps API and Google Maps Engine providing unparalleled content, security and mobility.  Mapping Technologies


  Underground Infrastructure Mapping and Data Acquisition Geospatial was founded on the basis of mapping underground infrastructure. Through the combination of pipeline locating expertise and proprietary technology, Geospatial is able to deliver clients accurate and comprehensive maps of their underground infrastructure. The value of this emerging concept is expounded by the continual problems caused by aging and crowded underground infrastructure. Geospatial eliminates the risks and expense caused by poorly located and mapped infrastructure by creating accurate 3-D digital maps of underground pipelines.Through our innovative and proprietary data acquisition technologies, we map all types of underground infrastructure including oil and gas pipelines, water, sanitary, pressurized and non-pressurized, metal, non-metal, fiberglass, plastic, electrical, CATV, telephone, steel, ductile iron and much more. Our combination of technologies collects this data via gyroscopic techniques, electromagnetic sensors, radar, microwaves, infrared, acoustic detection and other hi-tech capabilities whether it is underground, above ground or underwater. Geospatial has various sensors for locating pipelines and other infrastructure and leaks from water, natural gas or oil that can be operated from either a vehicle, an ATV, or from an aerial platform such as a helicopter, a fixed wing aircraft or a UAV (un-manned aerial vehicle).     Facilities Management Data Leasing and Consulting Services Geospatial specializes in above and below ground facilities management programs that provide perpetual support to locate, map, and manage critical underground infrastructure throughout facilities, municipalities, educational campuses, military compounds, or gas and electric distribution systems spanning thousands of miles. Geospatial is uniquely positioned to aggregate this data, providing the client with information as to exactly where their underground infrastructure is and where it is not. In addition, Geospatial offers its Underground Infrastructure Data Leasing model where Geospatial, along with a strong financial partner, teams up to provide the resources, both technical and financial, to rapidly and efficiently, collect mapping and geo-referenced condition assessment data of the underground infrastructure within an entire facility. The data is then leased back to the client for a specified term. Our Underground Infrastructure Data Leasing® model greatly accelerates the time it takes for a facility owner to have access to this critical underground infrastructure information and begin enjoying the (ROI) return on investment derived from his immediate access to the knowledge generated by our data.    GIS/Data Management: GeoUnderground 	Once Geospatial collects the underground infrastructure data, it is digitally stored and securely maintained for easy access whether you are in the field, on the road or in an office. Geospatial has developed the ultimate in underground infrastructure mapping software with its GeoUnderground application. GeoUnderground is a secure, cloud-based, 3-D mobile mapping application enabling users to view x,y,z coordinates, start/end points, extents, diameters, areas, and even upload geo-referenced videos and photos with attached GPS data such as utility right-of-ways and pipeline interiors. Geospatial is accessible through the Internet on computers, tablets or other hand-held devices via a conventional browser.
