History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]
Office locations[edit]
The bank operates from 42 cities across 27 countries.[9]

History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]
Office locations[edit]
The bank operates from 42 cities across 27 countries.[9]

History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]
Office locations[edit]
The bank operates from 42 cities across 27 countries.[9]

History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  14.67 (07/21/17)      EPS (TTM)  $3.23      Market Cap $6.15 B     Shares Outstanding 129.77 M     Public Float 126.89 M     Yield 3.46% (07/21/17)      Latest Dividend $0.41 (05/19/17)      Ex-Dividend Date 05/04/17       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (06/30/17)    Shares Sold Short 2.50 M     Change from Last  9.43%      Percent of Float 1.97%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.99      Net Money Flow ($)  3.09 M    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

                From the Survey: Lazard Ltd.

 Founded in 1848, Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) operates as a financial advisory and asset management company. The asset manager engages in investment banking, provides investment advisory products and services, and manages more than $180 billion in assets across the globe. Lazard’s traditional and alternative investment services cover listed equity and fixed-income securities for a broad range of clients, including both institutional and retail services. Moreover the company, which is based in New York City, has a number of subsidiaries that help it operate in 41 cities across 26 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and South America.
Lazard is engaged in two primary businesses; Financial Advisory and Asset Management. The company’s revenue, which is split just about equally between the two, eclipsed $2 billion for the first time in 2013. The organization has been flourishing of late, as favorable fundamentals have enabled the shares to retain a good portion of their 12-month gains even as the market has undergone some painful selling. Lazard was able to increase its assets under management (AUM) by 15% in 2013, and will likely see another 10%-15% boost by this year’s end. Moreover, we think that Lazard’s diversification and strong asset allocation strategies will help it weather eventual rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. For the time being, however, we see near zero interest-rate policies (ZIRP) acting as a boost to Lazard’s overall equity strategy, auguring well for the near term.
BusinessStrategy
Management continues to focus on strengthening its marketing and consulting capabilities. In doing so, the company concentrates on expanding its geographic footprint and leveraging its vast amount of resources to gain new business relationships and increase ongoing ones. Over the past several years, the strategic plan that the company has implemented involved hiring more senior investment professionals and portfolio managers, enhancing investment performance, expanding the product platform, and improving business results in areas where it has struggled.
The Economic Backdrop
Economic and global financial conditions are the keys to what drives Lazard’s success. Recently, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported (a revised) 3.9% GDP growth for the third quarter. Payroll reports have also shown underlying strength in the economy, as has manufacturing. Indeed, we see the economy further improving and suspect that 2015 will add momentum to the recovery. Unfortunately, things across the globe are deteriorating. More specifically, the European economy seems closer to contracting than expanding. Just recently, the European Central Bank elected to enact policies similar to the Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program known as Quantitative Easing. If the new measures are adequate and serve to improve the economy, that could give Lazard a boost in its European business, which comprises about a third of its overall revenue.
Competitors
Lazard continues to grow at an impressive rate despite competing with several different corporations of much larger stature. Some of these include industry leader BlackRock, Inc. (BLK), T. Rowe Price (TROW), and Franklin Resources (BEN). Although Lazard operates in a diverse, competitive, and fast-rising industry, we believe the company is well suited to deal with the many challenges that lie ahead. In fact, Lazard has been one of the top performing stocks in the financial services industry throughout 2014, and we see that as a sign of continuing investor confidence and strong business results.
Conclusion
All told, we think investors should take a hard look at Lazard Ltd. The company’s strengths can be seen in its Asset Management business, where it has become one of the leaders in that industry and in its strong financial advisory business. Moreover, we believe that Lazard has the ability to leverage its existing infrastructure and wide ranging network to capitalize on the global macroeconomic recovery that could play out in 2015. Subscribers interested in learning more about this financial services company are advised to consult Value Line’s quarterly reports for Lazard, as well as any supplemental issuances and relevant articles that may arise as important news comes to light.
At the time of this article’s writing, the author did not have positions in any of the companies mentioned.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Lazard Ltd's consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ significantly from those expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those set forth in the sections entitled "Risk Factors" and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.  Business Summary  Lazard is one of the world's preeminent financial advisory and asset management firms. We have long specialized in crafting solutions to the complex financial and strategic challenges of a diverse set of clients around the world, including corporations, governments, institutions, partnerships and individuals. Founded in 1848 in New Orleans, we currently operate from 43 cities in key business and financial centers across 27 countries throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, the Middle East, and Central and South America.  Our primary business purpose is to serve our clients. Our deep roots in business centers around the world form a global network of relationships with key decision-makers in corporations, governments and investing institutions. This network is both a competitive strength and a powerful resource for Lazard and our clients. As a firm that competes on the quality of our advice, we have two fundamental assets: our people and our reputation.  We operate in cyclical businesses across multiple geographies, industries and asset classes. In recent years, we have expanded our geographic reach, bolstered our industry expertise and continued to build in growth areas. Companies, government bodies and investors seek independent advice with a geographic perspective, deep understanding of capital structure, informed research and knowledge of global economic conditions. We believe that our business model as an independent advisor will continue to create opportunities for us to attract new clients and key personnel.  Our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in the following business segments:   Financial Advisory, which offers corporate, partnership, institutional, government, sovereign and individual clients across the globe a wide array of financial advisory services regarding mergers and acquisitions ("M&A") and other strategic matters, restructurings, capital structure, capital raising and various other financial matters, and   Asset Management, which offers a broad range of global investment solutions and investment management services in equity and fixed income strategies, alternative investments and private equity funds to corporations, public funds, sovereign entities, endowments and foundations, labor funds, financial intermediaries and private clients.  In addition, we record selected other activities in our Corporate segment, including management of cash, investments and outstanding indebtedness, as well as certain commercial banking activities of Lazard Group's Paris-based subsidiary, Lazard Frères Banque SA ("LFB").  LFB is a registered bank regulated by the Autorite de Contrôle Prudentiel et de Resolution ("ACPR"). It is engaged primarily in commercial and private banking services for clients and funds managed by Lazard Frères Gestion SAS ("LFG") and for other clients, investment banking activities, including participation in underwritten offerings of securities in France, and asset-liability management.  Table of Contents  Our consolidated net revenue was derived from the following segments:   Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 Financial Advisory 53 % 49 % 55 % Asset Management 49 52 47 Corporate (2 ) (1 ) (2 ) Total 100 % 100 % 100 %  We also invest our own capital from time to time, generally alongside capital of qualified institutional and individual investors in alternative investments or private equity investments, and, since 2005, we have engaged in a number of alternative investments and private equity activities, including investments through (i) the Edgewater Funds ("Edgewater"), our Chicago-based private equity firm (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (ii) Lazard Australia Corporate Opportunities Fund 2 ("COF2"), a Lazard-managed Australian fund targeting Australasian mid-market investments, (iii) a mezzanine fund, which invests in mezzanine debt of a diversified selection of small-to mid-cap European companies and (iv) a fund targeting significant noncontrolling-stake investments in established private companies. We also make investments to seed our Asset Management strategies. We may explore and discuss opportunities to expand the scope of our alternative investment and private equity activities in Europe, the U.S. and elsewhere. These opportunities could include internal growth of new funds and direct investments by us, partnerships or strategic relationships, investments with third parties or acquisitions of existing funds or management companies.  In the third quarter of 2014, we entered into arrangements with LFCM Holdings LLC, which is now known as LMDC Holdings LLC ("LMDC Holdings") and continues to be owned in large part by former and current managing directors of Lazard (including our executive officers), and certain of its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the arrangements, among other things, (i) we acquired certain assets from LMDC Holdings relating to its convertible securities business, (ii) the business alliance provided for in the Business Alliance Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2005, between the Company and LMDC Holdings, terminated, and (iii) LMDC Holdings relinquished certain license rights previously granted under the License Agreement, dated as of May 10, 2005, between the Company and LMDC Holdings. In addition, LMDC Holdings surrendered certain leasehold interests, including leasehold improvements, to the Company, and was relieved of obligations to pay related sublease rent. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We do not believe that any of these arrangements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  The acquired assets facilitate the execution of exchange offers and other transactions related to financial advice provided by our Capital Advisory and Convertible Securities practice groups. In addition, we have taken steps that will enable us to act as an underwriter in public offerings and other distributions of securities from time to time in order to buttress our Financial Advisory business.  Business Environment and Outlook  Economic and global financial market conditions can materially affect our financial performance. As described above, our principal sources of revenue are derived from activities in our Financial Advisory and Asset Management business segments. As our Financial Advisory revenues are primarily dependent on the successful completion of merger, acquisition, restructuring, capital raising or similar transactions, and our Asset Management revenues are primarily driven by the levels of assets under management ("AUM"), weak economic and global financial market conditions can result in a challenging business environment for M&A and capital-raising activity as well as our Asset Management business, but may provide opportunities for our restructuring business.  Despite some market volatility in the fourth quarter of 2014, equity market indices for developed markets at December 31, 2014 increased as compared to such indices at December 31, 2013, with U.S. markets generally outpacing European markets. Emerging markets indices at December 31, 2014 generally decreased as compared to December 31, 2013. In the global M&A markets during 2014, the number and value of all completed M&A  Table of Contents  transactions increased as compared to the same period in the prior year, as did the subset of such transactions involving values greater than $500 million. During the same time, the number and value of all announced M&A transactions, including the subset of such transactions involving values greater than $500 million, also increased, reflecting an active global M&A environment. During 2014, global restructuring activity remained low, consistent with the last several years.  Entering 2015, corporate cash balances remain high and the outlook for interest rates remains low. The U.S. macroeconomic environment has improved, but Europe and many of the developing markets remain unsettled. Volatility has returned to the capital markets, but the underpinnings of the U.S.-led global economic recovery appear to remain in place. Although market volatility may continue, the longer-term trends appear to remain favorable for both of our businesses.  We intend to leverage our existing infrastructure to capitalize on any global macroeconomic recovery, positive momentum in the M&A cycle, and strength in the global equity markets. We expect to generate revenue growth by remaining adequately staffed to capitalize on any macroeconomic recovery and deploying our intellectual capital to generate new revenue streams.  Our outlook with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is described below.   Financial Advisory - The fundamentals for continued growth of a strategic M&A cycle appear to remain in place. Demand continues for expert, independent strategic advice that can be levered across geographies and our range of advisory capabilities. The global scale and breadth of our Financial Advisory business allows us to advise on large, complex cross-border transactions across a variety of industries. In addition, we believe our businesses throughout the emerging markets, Japan and Australia position us for growth in these markets, while enhancing our relationships with, and the services that we can provide to, clients in developed economies.   Asset Management - Generally, we have seen increased investor demand across regions and investment platforms. In the short to intermediate term, we expect most of our growth will come from defined benefit and defined contribution plans in the developed economies because of their sheer scope and size. Over the longer term, we expect an increasing share of our AUM to come from the developing economies in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, as their retirement systems evolve and individual wealth is increasingly deployed in the financial markets. Our global footprint is already well established in the developed economies and we expect our business in the developing economies will continue to expand. Given our globally diversified platform and our ability to provide investment solutions for a global mix of clients, we believe we are positioned to benefit from growth that may occur in the asset management industry. We recently extended the global footprint of our Asset Management business by opening new offices in Zurich, Singapore, Dubai and Dublin. We are continually developing and seeding new investment strategies that extend our existing platforms. Recent examples of growth initiatives include the following investment strategies: Emerging Markets Debt, Emerging Markets Small Cap Equity, Real Estate, Managed Volatility Strategies, Middle East North African Equities, Asian Equities, U.S. Long/Short Equity and International Concentrated Equity.  We operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge continuously, and it is not possible for our management to predict all risks and uncertainties, nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K. Furthermore, net income and revenue in any period may not be indicative of full-year results or the results of any other period and may vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter.  Overall, we continue to focus on the development of our business, including the generation of stable revenue growth, earnings growth and shareholder returns, the prudent management of our costs and expenses, the efficient use of our assets and the return of capital to our shareholders.  Table of Contents  Certain data with respect to our Financial Advisory and Asset Management businesses is included below.  Financial Advisory  As reflected in the following table, which sets forth global M&A industry statistics, the value and number of all completed transactions, including completed transactions with values greater than $500 million, increased in 2014 as compared to the 2013 period. With respect to announced M&A transactions, the value and number of all transactions, including announced transactions with values greater than $500 million, increased in 2014 as compared to the 2013 period.   Year Ended December 31, % 2014 2013 Incr / (Decr) ($ in billions) Completed M&A Transactions: All deals: Value $ 2,915 $ 2,723 7 % Number 38,428 38,090 1 % Deals Greater than $500 million: Value 2,112 1,899 11 % Number 1,042 996 5 % Announced M&A Transactions: All deals: Value $ 3,611 $ 2,849 27 % Number 40,656 38,120 7 %  Source: Dealogic as of January 13, 2015.  Global restructuring activity during 2014, as measured by the number of corporate defaults, decreased as compared to 2013, and the aggregate value of debt defaults remained low, consistent with the last several years. The number of defaulting issuers decreased slightly to 54 in 2014, according to Moody's Investors Service, Inc., as compared to 62 in 2013. In the U.S., the number of corporate defaults decreased 3% in 2014 as compared to 2013, while the value of such defaults increased substantially due to one large default in the 2014 period.  Asset Management The percentage change in major equity market indices at December 31, 2014, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2013, and at December 31, 2013, as compared to such indices at December 31, 2012, is shown in the table below. Percentage Changes December 31, 2014 vs. 2013 2013 vs. 2012 MSCI World Index 3 % 24 % Euro Stoxx 1 % 18 % MSCI Emerging Market (5 )% (5 )% S&P 500 11 % 30 %  The fees that we receive for providing investment management and advisory services are primarily driven by the level of AUM and the nature of the AUM product mix. Accordingly, market movements, foreign currency volatility and changes in our AUM product mix will impact the level of revenues we receive from our Asset  Table of Contents  Management business when comparing periodic results. A substantial portion of our AUM is invested in equities. Movements in AUM during the period generally reflect the changes in equity market indices. Our AUM at December 31, 2014 increased 5% versus AUM at December 31, 2013, primarily due to market appreciation and net inflows, partially offset by adverse foreign exchange movements. Average AUM for 2014 increased 13% as compared to average AUM in 2013.  Cost Saving Initiatives  In October 2012, we announced certain cost saving initiatives in order to reduce our compensation and non-compensation cost base. Expenses associated with implementation of the cost saving initiatives were completed in the second quarter of 2013 and were reflected in our financial results. These implementation expenses were approximately $64 million in 2013 and $103 million in 2012.  The cost saving initiatives were intended to improve our profitability with minimal impact on revenue growth, while allowing us to continue to invest in our business. The initiatives included: streamlining our corporate structure and consolidating support functions; realigning our investments into areas with potential for the greatest long-term return; the settlement of certain contractual obligations; reducing occupancy costs; and creating greater flexibility to retain and attract the best people and invest in new growth areas. The full impact of the savings resulting from the cost saving initiatives was reflected in our 2014 results.  See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Financial Statement Overview  Net Revenue  The majority of Lazard's Financial Advisory net revenue historically has been earned from the successful completion of M&A transactions, strategic advisory matters, restructuring and capital structure advisory services, capital raising and similar transactions. The main drivers of Financial Advisory net revenue are overall M&A activity, the level of corporate debt defaults and the environment for capital raising activities, particularly in the industries and geographic markets in which Lazard focuses. In some client engagements, often those involving financially distressed companies, revenue is earned in the form of retainers and similar fees that are contractually agreed upon with each client for each assignment and are not necessarily linked to the completion of a transaction. In addition, Lazard also earns fees from providing strategic advice to clients, with such fees not being dependent on a specific transaction, and may also earn fees in connection with public and private securities offerings. Significant fluctuations in Financial Advisory net revenue can occur over the course of any given year, because a significant portion of such net revenue is earned upon the successful completion of a transaction, restructuring or capital raising activity, the timing of which is uncertain and is not subject to Lazard's control.  Lazard's Asset Management segment principally includes Lazard Asset Management LLC (together with its subsidiaries, "LAM"), LFG and Edgewater. Asset Management net revenue is derived from fees for investment management and advisory services provided to clients. As noted above, the main driver of Asset Management net revenue is the level and product mix of AUM, which is generally influenced by the performance of the global equity markets and, to a lesser extent, fixed income markets as well as Lazard's investment performance, which impacts its ability to successfully attract and retain assets. As a result, fluctuations (including timing thereof) in financial markets and client asset inflows and outflows have a direct effect on Asset Management net revenue and operating income. Asset Management fees are generally based on the level of AUM measured daily, monthly or quarterly, and an increase or reduction in AUM, due to market price fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in product mix, or net client asset flows will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in management fees. The majority of our investment advisory contracts are generally terminable at any time or on notice of 30 days or less. Institutional and individual clients, and firms with which we have strategic alliances, can terminate their relationship with us, reduce the aggregate amount of AUM or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for a number of reasons, including investment performance, changes in prevailing interest rates and financial market  Table of Contents  performance. In addition, as Lazard's AUM includes significant amounts of assets that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to foreign currencies will impact the value of Lazard's AUM. Fees vary with the type of assets managed and the vehicle in which they are managed, with higher fees earned on equity assets and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds, and lower fees earned on fixed income and cash management products.  The Company earns performance-based incentive fees on various investment products, including traditional products and alternative investment funds, such as hedge funds and private equity funds.  For hedge funds, incentive fees are calculated based on a specified percentage of a fund's net appreciation, in some cases in excess of established benchmarks or thresholds. The Company records incentive fees on traditional products and hedge funds at the end of the relevant performance measurement period, when potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined. The incentive fee measurement period is generally an annual period (unless an account terminates during the year). The incentive fees received at the end of the measurement period are not subject to reversal or payback. Incentive fees on hedge funds are often subject to loss carryforward provisions in which losses incurred by the hedge funds in any year are applied against certain gains realized by the hedge funds in future periods before any incentive fees can be earned.  For private equity funds, incentive fees may be earned in the form of a "carried interest" if profits arising from realized investments exceed a specified threshold. Typically, such carried interest is ultimately calculated on a whole-fund basis and, therefore, clawback of carried interest during the life of the fund can occur. As a result, incentive fees earned on our private equity funds are not recognized until potential uncertainties regarding the ultimate realizable amounts have been determined, including any potential for clawback.  Corporate segment net revenue consists primarily of investment gains and losses on the Company's "seed investments" related to our Asset Management business, principal investments in private equity funds and "equity method" investments, net of hedging activities, as well as gains and losses on investments held in connection with Lazard Fund Interests ("LFI") and on the extinguishment of debt (to the extent applicable), interest income and interest expense. Corporate net revenue also can fluctuate due to changes in the fair value of investments classified as "trading", as well as due to changes in interest and currency exchange rates and in the levels of cash, investments and indebtedness.  Although Corporate segment net revenue during 2014 represented (2)% of Lazard's net revenue, total assets in the Corporate segment represented 59% of Lazard's consolidated total assets as of December 31, 2014, which are attributable to investments in government bonds and money market funds, debt and equity securities, interests in alternative investment, debt, equity and private equity funds, cash and assets associated with LFB.  Operating Expenses  The majority of Lazard's operating expenses relate to compensation and benefits for managing directors and employees. Our compensation and benefits expense includes (i) salaries and benefits, (ii) amortization of the relevant portion of previously granted deferred incentive compensation awards, including (a) share-based incentive compensation under the Lazard Ltd 2005 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2005 Plan") and the Lazard Ltd 2008 Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2008 Plan") and (b) LFI and other similar deferred compensation arrangements (see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), (iii) a provision for discretionary or guaranteed cash bonuses and profit pools and (iv) when applicable, severance payments. Compensation expense in any given period is dependent on many factors, including general economic and market conditions, our actual and forecasted operating and financial performance, staffing levels, competitive pay conditions and the nature of revenues earned, as well as the mix between current and deferred compensation.  We believe that "awarded compensation and benefits expense" and the ratio of "awarded compensation and benefits expense" to "operating revenue," both non-U.S. GAAP measures, are the most appropriate measures to assess the annual cost of compensation and provide the most meaningful basis for comparison of compensation  Table of Contents  and benefits expense between present, historical and future years. "Awarded compensation and benefits expense" for a given year is calculated using "adjusted compensation and benefits expense," also a non-U.S. GAAP measure, as modified by the following items:   We deduct amortization expense recorded for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") purposes in each fiscal year associated with the vesting of deferred incentive compensation awards,   We add (i) the deferred incentive compensation awards granted applicable to the relevant year-end compensation process (e.g. deferred incentive compensation awards granted in 2015, 2014 and 2013 related to the 2014, 2013 and 2012 year-end compensation processes, respectively) and (ii) investments in people (e.g. "sign-on" bonuses) and other special deferred incentive compensation awards granted throughout the applicable year, with such amounts in (i) and (ii) reduced by an estimate of future forfeitures of such awards, and   We adjust for year-end foreign exchange fluctuations.  We also use "adjusted compensation and benefits expense" and the ratio of "adjusted compensation and benefits expense" to "operating revenue," both non-U.S. GAAP measures, for comparison of compensation and benefits expense between periods. For the calculations with respect to "adjusted compensation and benefits expense" and "awarded compensation and benefits expense" and related ratios to "operating revenue," see the table under "Consolidated Results of Operations" below.  Compensation and benefits expense is the largest component of our operating expenses. Our goal is for annual awarded compensation and benefits expense to . . .

History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]
Office locations[edit]
The bank operates from 42 cities across 27 countries.[9]

History[edit]




Lazard's largest office is at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City, NY


Early years[edit]
On July 12, 1848, three Jewish French brothers, Alexandre, Lazare, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères & Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.[2]
In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London.[2]
The three houses of Lazard[edit]
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three “Houses of Lazard” in the United States, France, and England, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.[2]
In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market.[3]
In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today’s Lazard Asset Management.[4]
A unified firm[edit]
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.[5]
In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company, with nearly two-third of its shares owned by current and former employees in 2005. Wasserstein became its first Chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.[3]
Following Wasserstein’s sudden death in 2009, Lazard's Board of Directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs Chairman and CEO.[6]
Business overview[edit]
Financial advisory[edit]
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007.[7] Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard's Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.[8]
Asset management[edit]
Lazard's asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).[citation needed]
Office locations[edit]
The bank operates from 42 cities across 27 countries.[9]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
