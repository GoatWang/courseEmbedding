	1) 





	This entry represents the number of shares of ViaSat, Inc. common stock withheld by the Issuer to satisfy the tax withholding obligation of the Reporting Person. These shares were not sold by the Reporting Person but were instead offset from the total number of vested shares received by the Reporting Person from the Issuer.

	2) 





	The original restricted stock unit grant was for 9,167 restricted stock units on 11/17/2015. Subject to the reporting persons election to defer the receipt of the common stock, the units vest and convert into shares of common stock (on a 1 for 1 basis) at the rate of 1/4 on the 13th month anniversary of the grant date; 1/4 on the second anniversary of the grant date; 1/4 on the third anniversary and 1/4 on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.







	(
