Education[edit]
Dr. Miller received his PhD in International Relations from Georgetown University and a Masters in Public Policy from Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. His BA in Political Theory is also from Georgetown University.[4]
Career[edit]
Dr. Miller served as Director for Afghanistan on the National Security Council staff from September 2007 to September 2009 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Miller served on the staff of Douglas Lute, who served as Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan for President Bush and, subsequently, as Special Coordinator for Afghanistan and Pakistan for President Obama. Miller supported the presidential transition and continued in his position during the Obama Administration before accepting a position as Assistant Professor of International Security Affairs at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.[3][4]
Views on Afghanistan[edit]
Miller writes regularly about U.S. policy towards Afghanistan, Pakistan, and South Asia. He has argued that "The greatest threat to long-term success in Afghanistan is not the Taliban, who are fairly weak compared to other insurgent movements around the world. It is the Afghan government’s endemic weakness and the international community’s failure to address it."[5] Miller's proposed solution is greater attention to reconstruction and stabilization in Afghanistan.[6] He has criticized the views of conservatives, like George Will, as well as moderates and liberals, like David Rothkopf, who argue the war in Afghanistan is unwinnable.[7][8]

Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Board CertificationsWhy It Matters: Dr. Miller's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor.

More Why It Matters: Dr. Miller's Board CertificationsBoard certification should be one of your top considerations when choosing a doctor. Board certification is an official recognition given to doctors who have met specific requirements set by national medical specialty boards in the United States.Board certification indicates that a doctor is highly qualified in the medical field in which he or she practices.

A Praying Life: Connecting with God in a Distracting World (2nd Edition)
 Miller, Paul E.

Struggling to pray? Paul Miller offers biblical insights and relatable examples to help you achieve greater intimacy with God in a distracting world.   Going beyond a how-to of prayer, Miller encourages us to see prayer as an integral part of living each day in relationship with the Father rather than an isolated activity. 2017 Edition revised and updated throughout.

Product Description
More than 300,000 copies sold!"This book will be like having the breath of God at your back. Let it lift you to new hope." –Dan B. Allender, PhD, author of Bold LoveThis new edition includes an expanded chapter on using the practical "prayer cards"—a hallmark of the teaching found in A Praying Life—and a chapter on the need and use of prayers of lament.Prayer is so hard that unless circumstances demand it—an illness, or saying grace at a meal—most of us simply do not pray. We prize accomplishments and productivity over time in prayer. Even Christians experience this prayerlessness—a kind of practical unbelief that leaves us marked by fear, anxiety, joylessness, and spiritual lethargy.Prayer is all about relationship. Based on the popular seminar by the same name, A Praying Life has discipled thousands of Christians to a vibrant prayer life full of joy and power. When Jesus describes the intimacy He seeks with us, He talks about joining us for dinner (Revelation 3:20). A Praying Life feels like having dinner with good friends. It is the way we experience and connect to God. In A Praying Life,  author Paul Miller lays out a pattern for living in relationship with God and includes helpful habits and approaches to prayer that enable us to return to a childlike faith.

Phillip Miller and Paul Scoptur—among the most skilled of advocacy teachers—cover the full range of essentials to your becoming a deposition master. They show you what needs to be done and why, and—with striking clarity and directness—exactly how to do it. This book is a strong addition to our advocacy resources.—David Ball, author of David Ball on Damages 3 and Reptile


No one in America understands and teaches techniques for depositions that devastate defenses better than Miller and Scoptur—no one.—Jim Lees, member of the American Association for Justice and West Virginia Trial Lawyers Association


Paul Scoptur and Phillip Miller approach depositions through the lens of years of experience with focus groups, taking strong depositions themselves, and teaching how to conduct depositions. They know how to obtain the most from a witness in any deposition situation.—Jerome O’Neill, fellow of the International Society of Barristers, member of the American Board of Trial Advocates, former president of the Vermont Association for Justice, cochair of the NCA Board of Trustees, member of the AAJ Board of Governors


Having worked with Paul and Phillip as litigation consultants in all the major trucking litigation my office handles, I can unequivocally state the techniques work, work exceptionally well, and have caused more than one insurance company to tender limits in what were not only ‘no offer’ cases but ‘never offer’ cases. The distilling of the best deposition techniques from multiple schools of thought makes this a must-read. Every lawyer in my office had to read this book before they took another deposition. Every new lawyer in my office will have to read this book before they read the first case file. Strategic, tactical, timely, and immediately useful, this book is a must-read for every lawyer who ever plans to take a deposition.—Morgan G. Adams, past chair, AAJ Trucking Litigation Group; diplomate, National College of Advocacy


Paul Scoptur: Great teacher. Great motivator. He was hard on us, but we deserved it. Excellent communicator with outstanding grasp of the core deposition techniques. He also motivated me to go out and try them!—Vince Parrett, member of Motley Rice, LLC; served as naval officer and trial lawyer in U.S. Navy JAG Corps


Advanced Depositions Strategy and Practice is the bible on how to take effective depositions that generate big settlements and serious verdicts.—Bill Barton, author of Recovering for Psychological Injuries, 3rd edition, and past president of the Oregon and Western Trial Lawyers Associations


This book is a must-have in any plaintiff lawyer’s library. Phillip and Paul are masters at the art and science of deposition taking, and this book and DVD with video examples teaches time-proven techniques that lead to killer depositions. And we all know killer depositions lead to better settlements and verdicts!—Mark R. Kosieradzki, past chair, AAJ Nursing Litigation Group; faculty member, AAJ Advanced Deposition College


Advanced Depositions Strategy and Practice is exactly the kind of book lawyers must read to ensure they are confident not only at the deposition, but also at trial or the negotiating table. Many guides to depositions can do the former, leaving the attorney with the feeling that the deposition itself was a ‘win’ and covered all the necessary ground. Few can do the latter, setting up victory down the road, when it really counts. This book does both by explaining every part of the process from multiple angles, with insight and practical examples from years of experience, plus advice and anecdotes from lawyers across the country.—Bryan F. Aylstock, appointee to leadership roles in several Plaintiffs’ Steering Committees for Multi-District Litigations, including co–lead counsel and multi-district coordinator; founding partner of litigation firm Aylstock, Witkin, Kreis & Overholtz, PLLC


Phillip Miller and Paul Scoptur have put together what should be the ‘go to’ book on depositions. They have combined decades of knowledge, experience, and tried-and-true methods and now share their expertise and wisdom with other trial lawyers so that they can improve their own skills. This book is not simply routine checklists, but detailed explanations and techniques that should be followed to get the most out of every deposition taken. The Miller Mousetrap and the advanced deposition techniques (summarizing, boxing in, etc.) alone are worth the price and will pay for themselves as soon as they are used in a difficult deposition. The deposition skills that Miller and Scoptur teach in this book and their trial advocacy programs are presented in a clear and easy-to-use format that will show you how to get more from each and every deposition. Given that a case can be won or lost in a deposition, everyone should turn to this book during deposition preparation until it’s dog-eared with use. This book must be on every lawyer’s shelf no matter how long he or she has been practicing.—Carrie R. Frank, JD, MSSW


Not only is this masterpiece a ‘must read’ for every lawyer in our office—it is also our law firm’s new deposition strategy bible! [This] book is user-friendly, practical, loaded with step-by-step methodologies that we can use ‘next Monday,’ and it is loaded with practical hints on how to win the deposition and win the case. Paul and Phillip have redefined ‘obstacle-ism,’ as this book is a trial advocate’s compass, guiding you through and over and under every foreseeable obstacle to be faced in key depositions!—John F. Romano, former president, Academy of Florida Trial Lawyers; fellow, International Academy of Trial Lawyers


Among the ‘thought leaders’ at the annual AAJ Deposition Colleges, no two lawyers have helped develop the best techniques for preparing for and taking a discovery deposition more than Phillip Miller and Paul Scoptur. Their new and latest collaboration is an absolute essential for all trial lawyers and litigators. To get the best results, and put our clients’ cases in the best position to maximize settlement or verdict potential, I urge you to read and reread the many effective tools, techniques, and jury skills in their assembly of deposition weaponry. Used properly, as Phillip and Paul teach, your deps will always become a successful step to settlement or trial.—Tom Vesper, listed in Best Lawyers in America






1 review for Advanced Depositions Strategy and Practice





5 out of 5


Bryan Hutchinson – May 31, 2016

Great book! Before reading this book my depositions were often lacking key concessions or achieving key fact finding. I now go into each deposition with a clear goal of what I want to achieve and a better outcome. This book should be read in conjunction with the Deposition Handbook.
