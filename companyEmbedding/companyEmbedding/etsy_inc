Can Etsy Demonstrate Growth Momentum? - Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ETSY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Can Etsy Demonstrate Growth Momentum?Mar.27.17 | About: Etsy, Inc. (ETSY) Anthony Fratini Value, Growth, bonds, long onlySummaryEtsy, Inc. faces tough competition from both public and private e-commerce companies.Revenues are increasing year over year but at a decreasing rate.New products and services will enable the company to continue to grow market share.Etsy can be considered as a potential growth investment with acceptable risk at or below $10 per share.Thesis The intent of this article is to: 1. Review the Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) business model, fundamental indicators, technical indicators, and competition. 2. Determine if Etsy is a buy, sell, or hold. Data Source, Tables, Table Calculations, & Charts Unless otherwise specified, all financial data in this article was accessed from E*Trade.com. All tables, table calculations, and charts were created by the author. Company Business Model "Etsy, Inc. operates a marketplace to connect people around the both online and offline for making, selling and buying goods. The Company's geographical segments include United States and International. The Company's community includes Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, wholesale partners, manufacturers and Etsy employees. The Company's platform includes a marketplace, a seller services platform, and technology and community, both online and offline. The Company offers a range of services to help Etsy sellers build their personal brands, engage customers and complete transactions. The Company has over three seller services: Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout and Shipping Labels. Its Promoted Listings offering enables an Etsy seller to pay a cost-per-click-based fee to feature and promote her goods in search results generated by Etsy buyers on its platform. Its Direct Checkout offering allows Etsy sellers to accept various forms of payment, such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal and Etsy gift cards." 


 

 Source: Etsy.com On March 3, 2015, Etsy announced that it had filed for a $100 million IPO. Etsy now generates transactions around 2 billion on its platform, which has 54 million members. The Lynch Investment Philosophy Peter Lynch took over the Fidelity Magellan Fund in 1977. At the time, the fund assets were about $20M. Under his leadership, the fund outperformed the market by a whopping 13.4% per year annualized. Lynch believed individual investors had an advantage over large institutions because large firms are unable or unwilling to invest in small caps that were not getting the attention of the analysts or mutual funds. Lynch authored several books on investing but his three basic investment rules are as follows: 1. Only buy what you understand 2. Always do your homework 3. Invest for the long run When it comes to understanding the Etsy business model, my wife is the expert. She is a loyal Etsy customer because of many pleasant purchase experiences. She told me that, with Etsy, she was able to work directly with a seller to make the perfect dog collar just for our puppy. Analysts Price Targets E*Trade's price target of $14.30 is based on 6 ranked analyst estimates. Thomson Reuters' price target is $14.70 based on 11 ranked analyst estimates. Also, on 01 March 2017, Blake Harper of Loop Capital maintained his "Buy" rating and a $16 price target on Etsy, despite the recent drop in share price following a "below consensus revenue outlook." 


 Annual Revenue Etsy is indeed growing. However, when you look at the percent change in revenue year over year, the revenue growth is happening at a decreasing rate. The table and chart below is a summary of annual revenue since 2012 and also includes analysts' estimates for years 2017-2020 (yellow bars). The red line in the bar chart shows the revenue growth trend. 

 

 Growth Is Expensive What levers can Etsy pull to reduce costs? Etsy's primary operating expenses are Cost of Revenue, Selling/Gen/Admin Expenses, Labor & Related Expenses, and R&D expenses. The company has labor expenses under control with an average 3.2% of revenue. Cost of Revenue is not likely to decrease much leaving Selling/Gen/Admin and R&D for potential cost reduction opportunities moving forward. 

 Source: Company 2016 10-k 

 I would like to see the company reduce its Selling/Gen/Admin expenses by 5% in 2017; a savings that could go directly to its bottom line.
 Technical Analysis After months of basing around the $12.50 support level, the stock finally broke to the downside and is now selling for around $10 per share. The recent 16.3% drop (2/27-2/28) attributed to a below consensus revenue outlook. The stock price is well below both its 50- and 100-day moving average. The Slow Stochastics technical indicator is approaching the oversold (20%) line. The Money Flow technical Indicator has been basing around 40, slightly above the oversold condition. My opinion is that the stock is oversold below $10 per share and may represent an investment opportunity. Yearly Chart (With Weekly Candle Stick Bars, Stochastics, & Money Flow Index) 

 Source: E*Trade Earnings Per Share There is nothing good about negative earnings. However, for a new company that went IPO in 2015, the negative earnings are trending up towards greener pastures. Analysts are giving Etsy the green light in 2017 and beyond. 

 

 Cash is King As of December 2016, Etsy had $182M on hand, down from $271M. Cash flow per share is on the rise. However, free cash flow per share (i.e. cash available after a company pays all its bills) has been hovering around $0 since 2012. Going back to what I said above, even a modest 5% reduction in Selling/Gen/Admin expenses would raise the free cash flow per share line above zero.
 

 Debt As of December 2016, total company debt was $12M. The company has a revolving credit facility but no amounts have been drawn. The company has very low debt ratios: Debt/Assets Ratio = 0.02. Debt/Equity Ratio = 0.03. 

 Source: Company 10-K 

 Analysts Buy/Sell/Hold Recommendations Based on E*Trade, Thomson Reuters and Zacks, Etsy is a HOLD. Recent E*Trade Smart Consensus Peer Ratings show 10 Buys, 40 Holds, and 18 Sells. 

 Data Sources: E*Trade, Thomson Reuters, Zacks.com Competition (Publicly Traded Companies) A Fundamental Data Summary of Publicly Traded "Handmade" Companies The following table is a summary of fundamental data for Etsy and the other public companies offering similar services for handmade buyers and sellers. 


 The tables above are sorted by market cap. The Definition of "Handmade" First, we need to define "handmade." Well, as it turns out, it depends on who you ask. Both Etsy and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) have different definitions and rules. Amazon defines handmade as anything that is made entirely by hand, hand-altered, or hand assembled by companies with less than 20 employees or collectives with less than 100 employees. Etsy defines handmade as anything made or designed by the seller. If the seller uses outside help, it must be approved by Etsy. Most e-commerce businesses these days compete for customers with publicly traded companies such as Amazon and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) so that is a given. Other publicly traded companies that Etsy competes with include (but may not be limited to): Alibaba (NYSE: BABA), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Leaf Group (NYSE:LFGR). Amazon Amazon launched "Handmade" in October 2015 to compete with Etsy's Handmade business. A typical "100% Handmade Dog Collar" search result from Amazon is shown below… 

 Alibaba Launched in 1999, Alibaba is Chinese e-commerce company that provides consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business sales services via web portals. The company offers millions of products in over 40 different major categories, including consumer electronics, machinery and apparel. The company does business in 190+ countries and regions. A typical "100% Handmade Dog Collar" search result from Alibaba is shown below… 


 I noticed in some cases (like the one above) that you have to buy in bulk, which would not work for most individual buyers unless the intent was to resell, making Etsy the better (or maybe easier) choice for the typical handmade buyer. eBay eBay, like Amazon, sells everything. My wife sells a lot of stuff on eBay. However, she does not buy handmade from eBay or Amazon. Anytime she is looking to buy that special one-of-a-kind item, she uses Etsy. A typical "100% Handmade Dog Collar" search result from eBay is shown below… 

 Shopify and Leaf Group are e-commerce platform solutions for sellers. Although, buyers would not typically buy from these websites, I mention them here because they compete directly with Etsy seller platforms. Competition (Privately Owned Companies) The list of privately owned e-commerce companies in direct competition with Etsy is a long one. Here are a few of the more popular ones… 

 

 Graphic & Data: Toughnickel.com Note, Etsy was included in the table above for comparison. Buyers and Sellers Both buyers and sellers are growing, but at a decreasing rate. So the future may appear cloudy, but if there is a silver lining in the cloud cover, it is buyers are increasing at a faster rate than sellers. The red line in the charts below show the decreasing rate of buyers and sellers (year over year).
 

 

 Data Source: Etsy, Inc. 10-K New products and services spur growth and thus will improve flat buyer and seller growth. New Products & Services No doubt, Etsy is facing some major headwinds. E-Commerce competition is as tough as it gets. Growing revenue at a decreasing rate can only be sustained for so long. The only way to survive is to keep coming up with new and innovative products and services. I think Etsy is doing just that. 2016 Completed Projects  Launched Pattern by Etsy, a (fourth) paid Seller Service. Expanded Direct Checkout into 14 new countries. Added expedited United States Postal Service Shipping Labels, partnered with Google to launch Google Shopping tool. Added search and machine learning capabilities with the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies and launched a global brand campaign called "Difference Makes Us" to highlight Etsy as a go-to shopping destination for buyers around the world.  2017 Launched Shop Manager Shop Manager can track seller orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics and have conversations with buyers, for all of their Etsy channels in one place. It's a centralized operating hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their Etsy businesses. 2017 Etsy Studio and Multi-Shop The company announced plans to launch a market dedicated to craft supplies. Etsy Studio will enable craft supplies sellers to tap into a larger audience of crafters, makers and DIY enthusiasts around the world. The market will offer millions of listings along with content such as tutorials and craft ideas, so buyers will be able to find both materials and inspiration for their next projects.
 Launching a Multi-Shop checkout system that will enable buyers to complete purchases from multiple sellers with Direct Checkout in one simple transaction and guest checkout will allow buyers to make purchases from sellers without creating or signing into an Etsy account. Source: Etsy, Inc. website Conclusion Etsy is a young and growing company facing tough competition from both public and private e-commerce companies. Etsy customers are loyal and keep coming back. Revenues are increasing year over year but at a decreasing rate, and General & Admin expenses are on the rise. Not a good combination for sustaining growth. Both buyers and sellers are increasing, but at a decreasing rate. However, buyers are increasing at a faster rate than sellers. Etsy has positioned itself well in a niche market and, I think, is ahead of its competition in terms of new products and services that will enable the company to continue to grow. I believe Etsy will continue to grow its market share and should be considered as a potential growth investment with acceptable risk at an entry point close to $10 per share.

Etsy to lay off 15% of its workforce, bringing total reduction to 22% this year
Etsy Inc.  shares were up 1% in premarket trade Wednesday after the company announced it is cutting 15% of its workforce, or about 140 positions. This adds to previous headcount reductions to bring the total of layoffs to 230 positions, or a 22% reduction in its workforce this year. Along with the May reduction in staff, the company replaced its Chief Executive Chad Dickerson with Josh Silverman, an Etsy board member. The layoffs will largely be in marketing, product management, general and administrative positions, Etsy said, and will largely take place in the company's Brooklyn headquarters. Silverman said the layoffs were put in place to focus on initiatives including search and discovery, improving seller tools and increasing marketing speed. Wednesday's reduction of workforce is expected to cost $6 million to $8.8 million, in addition to the $6.5 million to $8 million in costs associated with the layoffs announced in May. Shares of Etsy have gained 40% in the past three months, compared to the S&P 500's  gain of 4%.

This 2015 IPO May Finally Be Crafting A Breakout Move
With failed IPOs from Snap (SNAP) and Blue Apron (APRN), as well as a sharp pullback from Canada Goose (GOOS), new issues have lost some luster among investors.

About EtsyWith an Etsy coupon code, you don’t have to travel around the world to sample the wares of international merchants and artisans. That’s because its founders didn’t just aim to design an online marketplace—that had already been done—instead, their goal was to infuse online commerce with the unique passion that only artisans and collectors can provide. If you’re looking for a bold statement necklace or a shabby-chic armchair, pare down the cost with an Etsy promo code.Etsy was founded on June 18, 2005 by Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik, at the time running a small company known as iospace. Today, the company is known for not only giving artisans a place to share their handiwork with the world, but to make money at the same time. These products range from handmade jewelry and clothing to vintage pieces and recycled and upcycled goods. The whole shopping process is made easy for sellers and customers alike thanks to the website’s sleek and intuitive design. Shoppers can either type their queries in the search bar on the homepage, or browse through categories that range from home and living to weddings and gift ideas. Before you look around, grab an Etsy coupon code from Groupon Freebies to save on your next purchase.Because of its efforts to address social and environmental problems, Etsy has become a certified B Corporation. This accolade, according to the Etsy blog, is “like a LEED or Fair Trade certification, but for a business,” and puts Etsy alongside the likes of ecological-guardian Patagonia, a purveyor of outdoor clothing and gear that for decades has worked toward conservation efforts. How did Etsy earn this honor? The company strives to make a positive impact on both a local and global scale with earth-empathic initiatives that range from donating compost to a community farm to providing employees with loaner bicycles.In the old days, finding good vintage stuff involved the arduous process of driving to a consignment shop, browsing through the items, and carrying your purchases home in a bag.

That’s because its founders didn’t just aim to design an online marketplace—that had already been done—instead, their goal was to infuse online commerce with the unique passion that only artisans and collectors can provide. If you’re looking for a bold statement necklace or a shabby-chic armchair, pare down the cost with an Etsy promo code.Etsy was founded on June 18, 2005 by Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik, at the time running a small company known as iospace. Today, the company is known for not only giving artisans a place to share their handiwork with the world, but to make money at the same time. These products range from handmade jewelry and clothing to vintage pieces and recycled and upcycled goods. The whole shopping process is made easy for sellers and customers alike thanks to the website’s sleek and intuitive design. Shoppers can either type their queries in the search bar on the homepage, or browse through categories that range from home and living to weddings and gift ideas. Before you look around, grab an Etsy coupon code from Groupon Freebies to save on your next purchase.Because of its efforts to address social and environmental problems, Etsy has become a certified B Corporation. This accolade, according to the Etsy blog, is “like a LEED or Fair Trade certification, but for a business,” and puts Etsy alongside the likes of ecological-guardian Patagonia, a purveyor of outdoor clothing and gear that for decades has worked toward conservation efforts. How did Etsy earn this honor? The company strives to make a positive impact on both a local and global scale with earth-empathic initiatives that range from donating compost to a community farm to providing employees with loaner bicycles.In the old days, finding good vintage stuff involved the arduous process of driving to a consignment shop, browsing through the items, and carrying your purchases home in a bag. There’s an easier way, now that you’ve found these Etsy coupons.×About Etsy×Share this coupon with friends:    : How Coupons Work×How Coupons WorkWhen shopping other websites and stores, check out Groupon Coupons for exclusive coupon codes, free offers, and other giveaways.

          Announces CEO Transition

BROOKLYN, N.Y., May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ:   ETSY), which builds markets, services and economic opportunity for creative entrepreneurs, today announced financial results for its first quarter, ended March 31, 2017.
Senior Leadership Transition








The Company also announced that the Etsy Board of Directors has appointed Josh Silverman, a director on the Board since November 2016, as CEO, effective May 3, 2017. Josh succeeds Chad Dickerson, who will step down as CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors. Chad will serve in an advisory role to the Company through May 31, 2017. Fred Wilson, who joined the Etsy Board in June 2007 and has served as lead independent director since October 2014, will succeed Chad as Chair of the Board.
As the new CEO of Etsy, Josh has two decades of product development, marketing and e-commerce expertise. His deep industry experience includes leading and growing consumer technology companies and scaling global marketplaces. Josh previously served as President of Consumer Products and Services at American Express. Before American Express, Josh was CEO of Skype, CEO of shopping.com, an eBay company, and held various executive roles at eBay. He was also a co-founder and CEO of Evite, Inc. and he currently serves on the board of directors of Shake Shack.
Fred said, "Etsy is very fortunate to have Josh stepping into the CEO role at this time. He brings twenty years of senior leadership in technology and marketplace businesses to Etsy. In the six months that Josh has been on our Board, we have gotten to know him well and he has gotten to know us well. That will make for an easier transition and faster execution. I am pleased to be appointed Chair of the Etsy Board and I am looking forward to working closely with Josh and the leadership team to help Etsy capitalize on its significant growth opportunities."
Fred added, "On behalf of the Board and the entire Etsy team, I want to thank Chad for building Etsy into the wonderful company that it is. Over the last six years as CEO, Chad has transformed a chaotic startup into a world class company, and in the process grew the revenues our sellers make over nine times, the revenues Etsy generates almost fourteen times and the operating profit Etsy generates almost fifteen times. And in doing that, Chad never lost sight of the original vision and the unique culture that makes Etsy the very best home for creative entrepreneurs. We have benefited greatly from his leadership."
Josh said, "I have a deep appreciation for the mission of Etsy and the unique role that it plays in global e-commerce. Our focus will remain on delivering value to our community, including our shareholders. Having worked at other marketplaces, I recognize how difficult it is to create a differentiated value proposition for buyers that provides a unique opportunity for sellers—and Etsy has done that. In the coming weeks, I look forward to listening and learning from our employees, sellers, buyers and shareholders to help ensure we are focusing on the most value-enhancing near- and long-term opportunities."
Chad said, "It has been an honor to lead Etsy as CEO for the past six years and the three years before that as CTO. The Board decided that it was time for new leadership to take Etsy forward and I support that decision. I deeply admire and respect each and every person on the Etsy team who has worked so hard during my tenure to deliver a great experience for Etsy buyers and economic empowerment for creative entrepreneurs around the world. I have the greatest degree of confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for Etsy under Josh's leadership. I wish the company and the community the greatest success and look forward to supporting the global community of Etsy sellers as a regular buyer after the transition."
In addition, the Company also announced that John Allspaw, Chief Technology Officer, will be leaving the Company and Mike Brittain, VP of Engineering, will be named interim CTO. Mr. Allspaw will serve in an advisory role to the Company through May 31, 2017.

First Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights 
"During the first quarter, we laid the groundwork for key initiatives and launches that will enhance Etsy's capabilities and offerings for sellers and buyers, strengthen the brand and help position Etsy for long-term growth," continued Chad. "Etsy is actively investing in machine learning, search and marketing to attract new buyers and drive purchase frequency. Additionally, we just completed the successful launch of Etsy Studio. Although a challenging February contributed to lower than anticipated first quarter results, I am confident that the fundamental strength of Etsy's business and its unique competitive position will drive long-term growth for all stakeholders."
GMS was $719.0 million, up 14.2% compared with the first quarter of 2016. On a currency-neutral basis (excluding the direct impact of currency translation on GMS from goods that are not listed in U.S. dollars) GMS growth in the first quarter of 2017 would have been 15.2%. Growth in GMS was supported by 12.4% year-over-year growth in active sellers and 18.5% year-over-year growth in active buyers. 
Continuing the trend we've seen for multiple quarters, mobile visits once again grew faster than desktop visits. Percent mobile visits was approximately 66% compared with approximately 63% in the first quarter of 2016 and approximately 65% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Percent mobile GMS was approximately 51% compared with 47% in the first quarter of 2016 and 49% in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, mobile GMS was more than 50% of overall GMS for the first time. Specifically, mobile web was the largest contributor to both overall visits as well as mobile GMS. Year-over-year aggregate conversion rate increased, despite the growing contribution of mobile web, which carries the lowest conversion rate of any device. In addition, conversion rate on every device - desktop, mobile web and mobile app - increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. During the first quarter, the year-over-year growth in mobile conversion rates led to a slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile GMS. Mobile app and mobile web GMS each continued to grow significantly faster than desktop GMS during the first quarter.
Percent international GMS was 32.1% in the first quarter of 2017, up from 30.3% in the first quarter of 2016, and up sequentially from 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, international GMS growth accelerated year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter.
During the first quarter of 2017, percent international GMS was largely driven by continued robust GMS growth between U.S. buyers and international sellers and GMS growth between buyers and sellers outside of the U.S., both in the same country and cross-border. GMS growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international GMS, growing 44% year-over-year during the first quarter. We believe the robust growth in this category demonstrates the progress we are making in building and deepening local Etsy communities around the world. GMS between U.S. sellers and international buyers declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter, an improvement from the trends we experienced in 2015 and 2016. 
Expense Reductions and Resource Realignment
Late last year, Etsy realigned its teams to better support the evolving needs of our business. This has resulted in strengthened cross-functional collaboration, increased accountability and faster execution. Building on this foundation, early in the second quarter of 2017, we also looked for opportunities to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure. As a result of this process, we have identified savings that will be realized through a combination of headcount reductions and a reduction in internal program expenses. In total, we expect to eliminate approximately 80 positions, which is approximately 8% of the total workforce.
Chad commented, "Today, we announced an expense reduction and realignment initiative to help position Etsy for growth. Etsy's business has evolved significantly over the past 12 years and, while decisions like these are never easy, the Board is confident that this initiative will give the Company greater focus and agility in the near term, while allowing the Company to continue expanding in key growth areas. I wish everyone who was affected the absolute best in whatever they choose to do next."
Recent Operational Highlights
Our product roadmap is focused on supporting sellers as they start, manage and scale their businesses and enhancing the buyer experience. Recent highlights include:
Etsy Studio launch

Last week, we launched Etsy Studio. Etsy Studio is the first new market that we've built since 2005 and will disrupt the global craft buying and selling experience. By offering a differentiated and category specific buyer experience we believe Etsy Studio will allow us to gain share in the large addressable craft supplies market. On Etsy Studio at the time of launch, our global craft sellers offered nearly eight million items to buyers around the world.

Product launches

We are using machine learning to make category-specific suggestions to improve the listing process and collect more accurate data. Our efforts around Structured Data will enable us to collect more attributes and information from sellers during the listing process so we can offer more advanced and relevant search filters and deliver more personalized recommendations. This will allow buyers to more quickly find the exact items for which they are searching. 
We recently updated our Direct Checkout payment service and rebranded it as Etsy Payments. Our ultimate goal with Etsy Payments is to offer all Etsy sellers and buyers one unified payments platform. For sellers, Etsy Payments offers a more flexible and easy way to manage how and when they receive payments and deposits. Buyers have access to 10 different payment options, including Android Pay for mobile app, launched in March. Additionally, our recent launches of Multi-Shop Checkout and Guest Checkout enable buyers to seamlessly purchase from multiple sellers in one transaction and check out without being signed into an Etsy account, respectively. We believe these collective enhancements can drive conversion and GMS growth by reducing friction in the checkout process.

Creating a unified business management offering for sellers

Since our February launch of Shop Manager, a centralized hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their Etsy business, we have received positive feedback from a number of sellers using the new platform. We believe this was an important step towards building a unified business management offering to help our sellers start, manage and scale their businesses. Shop Manager showcases the breadth and depth of our services and tools in one convenient place, which we believe can help encourage seller service adoption.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights
Total revenue was $96.9 million, up 18.4% year-over-year, driven by growth in both Markets and Seller Services revenue. Markets revenue grew 14.1%, driven by growth in transaction fee revenue and, to a lesser extent, growth in listing fee revenue. Seller Services revenue grew 23.9% year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue growth in Etsy Payments. Seller Services revenue also benefited from revenue growth in Promoted Listings and, to a lesser extent, Pattern by Etsy and Shipping Labels. Gross profit for the first quarter was $62.2 million, up 15.4% year-over-year and gross margin was 64.2%, down 170 bps compared with 65.9% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Total operating expenses were $64.3 million in the first quarter, up 36.4% year-over-year, and represented 66.4% of revenue, up from 57.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue is primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses and marketing expenses related to our brand campaign. 
During the first quarter, marketing expenses were $23.5 million, up 48.0% year-over-year and represented 24.2% of revenue compared with 19.4% in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by brand marketing spend, mostly on YouTube and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, digital acquisition marketing (which excludes brand marketing-related spend on YouTube and Facebook) and employee-related expenses. Digital acquisition marketing spend increased 25.9% year-over-year during the first quarter. 
Product development expenses were $18.1 million, up 48.1% year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs including additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies. Product development expenses increased as a percent of revenue to 18.7% compared with 14.9% in the first quarter of 2016.
G&A expenses were $22.8 million, up 19.3% year-over-year driven by increased employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses and post-combination stock compensation expense related to the acquisition of ALM year-over-year. G&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to 23.5% compared with roughly 23.3% in the first quarter of 2016. 
Based on build-to-suit accounting requirements, we recognized $0.8 million and $2.1 million in incremental depreciation and non-cash interest expense, respectively, in the first quarter related to our new headquarters, as expected. For more information on the cash impact of our build-to-suit lease agreement, please refer to "Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, compared with net income of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Etsy's net loss in the first quarter of 2017 included interest expense associated with the build-to-suit lease accounting related to our new headquarters, a $2.8 million foreign exchange gain and an income tax benefit of $1.1 million, all primarily non-cash. 
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $9.7 million, and declined 34.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 10.0%, down 800 bps year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA performance was driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses and an increase in marketing expenses as a percent of revenue.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared with $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was mainly driven by revenue growth. 
Cash, marketable securities and short-term investments were $276.0 million as of March 31, 2017.
Financial Guidance
In light of the leadership transition, Etsy's new management team will review the Company's 2017 guidance. The Company plans to provide guidance in conjunction with the announcement of its second quarter 2017 results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, we provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net income (loss) adjusted to exclude: interest and other non-operating expense, net; provision (benefit) for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; and foreign exchange gain. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform.
We believe that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest expense; and 
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.

Etsy is a peer-to-peer (P2P) e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and supplies, as well as unique factory-manufactured items. These items cover a wide range, including art, photography, clothing, jewelry, food, bath and beauty products, quilts, knick-knacks, and toys. Many sellers also sell craft supplies such as beads, wire and jewelry-making tools. All vintage items must be at least 20 years old.[2] The site follows in the tradition of open craft fairs, giving sellers personal storefronts where they list their goods for a fee of US$0.20 per item.[3]
As of December 31, 2014, Etsy had 54 million users registered as members,[4] and the online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods connected 1.4 million active sellers with 19.8 million active buyers.[5] At the end of 2014, Etsy had 685 employees,[6] and had 29 million items listed on its website.[7] In 2014, Etsy clocked a total sales (Gross Merchandise Sales or GMS) of US$1.93 billion on the platform.[4] Of this, 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% was generated outside the USA.[4]
In 2014, Etsy garnered a revenue of US$195.6 million, and registered a net loss of US$15.2 million. Etsy generates revenue primarily from three revenue streams. Its 'Marketplace' revenue includes a fee of 3.5% of sale value, which an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, and a listing fee of 20 cents per item. 'Seller Services', Etsy's fastest growing revenue stream, includes fees for services such as Promoted Listings, payment processing and purchases of shipping labels through the platform. 'Other' revenue includes fees received from third-party payment processors.[8]
In November 2016, Etsy disclosed it purchased Blackbird Technologies for $32.5 million. Blackbird Technologies is a startup that developed AI software used for shopping context - search applications.[9]

History[edit]
2005-2010[edit]




Etsy staff at work, July 2010






Art in the Etsy office in Brooklyn.


The site was launched in 2005[10] by iospace, a small company composed of Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik. The initial version had taken two and a half months to build.[11] Later Jared Tarbell joined the team. Former NPR executive Maria Thomas joined as COO in 2008, was promoted to CEO and left Etsy in December 2009. Robert Kalin resumed his role as CEO from December 2009 until July 2011.[12] Investors include Sean Meenan,[13] Spencer and Judson Ain, Union Square Ventures, and founders of Flickr and Delicious.[14]
Kalin said that he named the site Etsy because he "wanted a nonsense word because I wanted to build the brand from scratch. I was watching Fellini's 8 ½ and writing down what I was hearing. In Italian, you say 'etsi' a lot. It means 'oh, yes' (actually it's "eh, si"). And in Latin and French, it means 'what if.'"[15][16]
In Etsy's first year, it attracted attention for frequently adding new tools and functionality to the site to help sellers gain exposure and traffic, including Adobe Flash-based visualizations and a taxonomy of categories with tags.[17] Etsy passed $1.7 million in sales in May 2007.[18] On July 29, Etsy had its one-millionth sale and anticipated its two-millionth sale would occur mid-December 2007. In November 2007, buyers spent $4.3 million purchasing 300,000 items for sale on Etsy, an increase of 43 percent from October 2007.[3] In June 2007, it expected to be profitable by the fall,[19] but in December 2007 it was not a profitable company.[20] In January 2008, Etsy received an additional $27 million in funding from Union Square Ventures, Hubert Burda Media, and Jim Breyer.[21]
In February 2008, trouble at eBay, including a strike by some dissatisfied sellers, brought speculation that Etsy could be an increasing competitor.[22] At the same time, however, some Etsy sellers expressed unhappiness with how Etsy was handling complaints about stores.[23] At the time, a comparison of the two websites included complaints that on Etsy, items are difficult to find, the interface "feels slow", and the buying and selling process is United States-centric.[24] Other reviewers enjoyed using Etsy's specialized search options,[25][26] including the "Shop Local" tool.[27]
In July 2008, Rob Kalin ceded the position of CEO to Maria Thomas.[28] Some longtime Etsy employees left the company in August 2008, including founders Haim Schoppik and Chris Maguire.[29] In September 2008, Etsy hired Chad Dickerson, who formerly worked at Yahoo!, as Chief Technology Officer.[30] The company acknowledged concerns about vendors selling other people's work as their own.[31]
In April 2009, users organized an "etsyday" promotion on Twitter that brought extra attention to the site.[32] As of May 2009, it had approximately 60 employees and sales of $10 to 13 million per month,[33] possibly boosted by consumer interest in cheaper and more personalized goods due to the United States recession.[34]
In March 2011, Etsy "introduced a Facebook-style social networking system called People Search...to help buyers and sellers connect with each other and become friends". By doing so, Etsy made any past purchase with feedback easily searchable, which caused many complaints. Etsy then made changes to the site to better guard information regarding users' purchases.[35]
IPO and investor lawsuit[edit]
In March 2010, Kalin said that the company is profitable and "plans to go public, though not until at least next year."[36] Financial statements required to be filed by Etsy in order to go public show that due to reinvestment of annually increasing gross profits in marketing, product development, and management, the company has not reported a net profit as of 2015.[37]
In December 2010, Etsy said it had seven million registered users, and that it would continue to focus on a personal community feel as it grows larger, as that is part of what distinguishes it from eBay.[38]
On March 3, 2015, Etsy announced that it had filed for a $100 million USD IPO.[6][39] As of 2015, Etsy generated transactions worth US$1.93 billion on its platform, which has 54 million members.[40] Etsy went public on April 16, 2015. The company's valuation was $1.8 billion and raised $237 million in IPO proceeds.[41] Less than a month later, Etsy stock dropped more than 8%. The stock closed at $30 on its first day of trading on April 16 and dropped down to $20.32 as of May 11.[42]
Shortly after the IPO in 2015, a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Etsy claiming fraud. The suit claimed that Etsy's CEO and officers failed to disclose numerous problems with the site which could affect the stock price, among them that "more than 5 percent of all merchandise for sale on Etsy’s website may be either counterfeit or constitute trademark or copyright infringement” and that “brands are increasingly pursuing sellers on Etsy for trademark or copyright infringement, jeopardizing listing fees and commissions." The suit also claimed that Etsy management knew of the rampant trademark and copyright infringement but did little to stop it, and in fact worked to hide this information from potential invenstors.[43]
2011-2017[edit]
In July 2011, Chad Dickerson, CTO since September 2008, became CEO, upon the firing of Rob Kalin. Later CTOs were Kellan Elliot-McCrea and John Allspaw.[44]
In April 2012, a newspaper article about Etsy covered its fraud detection efforts;[45] Etsy had been criticized in the past for inconsistently applying its rules about items having to be handmade.[46] Later in April 2012, the writer of Regretsy, a popular blog, did independent research into a specific featured vendor, Ecologica Malibu, and found evidence to accuse the vendor of being a reseller, which would be against the Etsy Terms of Service.[47] The vendor asserted that it was in line with the Terms of Service, stating that the shop had simply failed to identify itself as a "collective" that included the work of several individuals, and many Etsy community members posted on the Etsy forum expressing unhappiness with the action (or lack of action) taken by Etsy.[48] As of June 2012, the vendor's account is no longer active on Etsy.[49]
In May 2012, Etsy raised $40 million in Series F funding, and announced the company had become B Corporation certified.[50] This funding is partly going toward expanding Etsy in international markets, including France, Germany, and Australia.[51]
On October 1, 2013, Dickerson held an online Town Hall Meeting to announce that Etsy would now permit factory-made goods and drop shipping, provided the seller either designed or hired designers of the items, disclosed to Etsy their factory, disclosed that they used factories and took "ownership" of the process. In that meeting and afterward, Etsy claimed the meaning of the word "handmade" should be redefined to encompass factory made.[52]
In September 2016, Etsy announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup, Blackbird Technologies.[53] Etsy Inc. after experience a first-quarter loss in May 2017, replaced its chief executive and cut 8% of its workforce. Board member Josh Silverman was appointed CEO over Chad Dickerson.[54]
In May 2017, the company's board replaced Dickerson as CEO with Josh Silverman, citing pressure from shareholders and poor profits.[55]
Main features[edit]
Selling[edit]
A variety of products are sold on Etsy, including arts supplies, handmade products and vintage pieces. Vintage pieces can only be listed if they are a minimum of 20 years old. In order to sell products on Etsy, users must create a username and have the option to create a shop name. The username cannot be changed once created. Creating a shop on Etsy is free, however each listing that is posted in the shop costs $0.20. Each listing will remain on the shop's page for 4 months, or until someone buys the product. The sale prices of products are determined by the shop owner, but Etsy claims 3.5% of the sale price of each listing. Shop owners are sent a bill at the end of every month containing the fees they owe, and they have until the 15th day of the following month to pay the Etsy bill.[56] Since on-line sign-up appears for every region internationally, Etsy provides a global shipping feature.[57]
Buying[edit]
Searching for products to buy on Etsy is generally intuitive and simple. On the homepage, potential buyers can type a product description into the search bar,[58] or they can "Browse" through a list of options on the left side of the homepage, which include Art, Home & Living, Jewelry, Women, Men, Kids, Vintage, Weddings, Craft Supplies, Trending Items, Gift Ideas, Mobile Accessories, and more.[59] Alternatively, buyers may choose from a list of categories by clicking on the "Categories" link under "More Ways to Shop". This will bring the user to a page of over 30 categories, each containing sub-categories.[60]
When a buyer views a product, he/she can view the positive percentage feedback of each seller to determine the reliability of the shop. Once a buyer finds a product he/she would like to buy, he/she clicks "Add to Cart", and that product is added to his/her virtual "Shopping Cart". The buyer may then continue shopping or purchase the selected item. In order to purchase items, buyers must have an account with Etsy. The account is free and can be integrated with Facebook. The total product and shipping costs are shown to the user prior to entering payment information so the user knows exactly how much is being paid. Sellers choose which payment options to offer buyers; options include credit/debit cards and PayPal, among others.[61]
Buyers should be aware that Etsy has a very poor record in protecting customer data and privacy.[62] As of 2016, according to the Privacy Policy Section on the Etsy website ; " By using Etsy, you authorise Etsy to use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where Etsy operates " .[63]
Operations[edit]




Etsy Labs community workspace area.


Etsy is popular as a side-business[64] as well as a place to buy goods made from recycled and upcycled materials,[65] along with less expensive or more unusual versions of mass-produced items.[66] The unique nature of many of the items for sale is part of their appeal to some shoppers.[67][68] Product photos on Etsy tend to be editorial or artistic instead of commercial catalog style.[69] Sellers can add tags to their products to help buyers find them,[70] and buyers can choose to search for items available locally.[71] Etsy staffers publish lists of featured items.[72]
Etsy makes money by charging a listing fee of USD 0.20 for each item and getting 3.5% of every sale,[73] with the average sale about $15 or $20. Most sellers are women[19] who tend to be college-educated and in their twenties and thirties.[33] Individual Etsy sellers decide which payment options to offer buyers; these options may include credit card, check, money order, PayPal, bank transfer, and Etsy gift card.[74][75]
Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional artists who use the site to make a living.[76] According to artists who have developed their Etsy stores into their primary jobs, scaling up production of handmade items can require more than full-time work,[77] especially during the holiday shopping season.[78]
Etsy's main office is located in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and it has hosted open crafting classes in the "Etsy Labs".[79] The site's technology, customer support, marketing/PR, business, and communications teams operate out of this office. Etsy Labs has a workspace that provides equipment and donated materials where members gather to make items, take and teach workshops, and attend special events.[3] Etsy also has an office in Berlin.[80] In April 2012, Etsy announced that it was taking steps to hire more women engineers to improve the gender balance of its team, as a website with majority women users but few women engineers.[81]
Etsy was one of the main members of the Handmade Consortium, a 2007 effort to encourage buying handmade holiday gifts.[20] Etsy has partnered with the retail chain West Elm to sell some Etsy products in its stores.[82][83] In December 2012, Etsy opened a temporary holiday storefront in SoHo, New York City.[78]
Ethos[edit]
In an interview in August 2013, CEO Chad Dickerson emphasized the importance of human interaction and meaning from creativity in regard to his perspective on Etsy. Dickerson described the website as "a platform that provides meaning to people, and an opportunity to validate their art, their craft", and after spending time with Etsy users, Dickerson learned that "all commerce is about real human interaction". Dickerson also provided a summation of Etsy that is a further reflection of the company's relationship- and meaning-based ethos: "At the end of every transaction, you get something real from a real person. There is an existential satisfaction to that."[84]
Competitors[edit]
As of March, 2016, Etsy's top three competitors according to Hoovers Online are Amazon Handmade, Craigslist, and eBay.[85] Etsy has been compared to "a crafty cross between Amazon and eBay",[18] and to "your grandma's basement".[86] Etsy also has a number of direct competitors. DaWanda, based in Germany, focuses on growing in European countries.[87] ezebee.com, based in Switzerland, is a global competitor, but also caters to freelancers and professionals[88] Bonanza (formerly Bonanzle and 1000 Markets[89]) is based in the United States and focuses on clothing and fashion, Zibbet and Made It which are based in Australia, iCraft is based in Canada,[90] Artfire is based in the United States,[91] and Hello Pretty is an online craft marketplace targeted at South Africans.[92] Tindie is based in Portland, Oregon, and focuses on technology and electronics.[93]
Asked about competitors, Etsy's European CEO said, "As far as I am concerned, the more people highlighting the value of supporting micro-producers and buying handmade and vintage directly from them, the better."[94]
Seller issues[edit]
Privacy[edit]
In an effort to add social networking features to Etsy, the company implemented features in 2011 that allowed users to search other users' buying histories and to trace their purchasing transactions. Etsy thought that this feature would allow Etsy users to connect to individuals with similar buying and/or selling histories and an automatic opt-in was applied to all users without the attainment of prior permission. Users of the service raised concerns over the feature's violation of privacy rights, but an official response was not released by the company.[95]
Ecologica Malibu[edit]
In April 2012, some Etsy users began requesting the removal of Ecologica Malibu from the website due to the shop's use of a wholesale manufacturer. Users complained that Ecologica Malibu's practice was contradictory to the anti-big business values of Etsy.[96] CEO Chad Dickerson responded in an Etsy blog post:

Much of the information we learn from investigations can’t be shared with the larger community out of respect for the privacy of the seller being investigated, so there is a natural divergence between what the community sees when they report a seller and what we see as we go deeper on the case. … [T]here are times when available public evidence suggests that a violation of our policy is clear, and our investigations find that it’s actually not the case.[97]

Many users are still not content with Dickerson's response.[98]
Production outsourcing[edit]
On Oct 1, 2013, Etsy changed its policy to allow sellers to outsource production to third parties and factories and to use shipping or fulfillment services.[99] The new rules allow products to be labeled "handmade" as long as the original idea for that item — or its "authorship" as C.E.O. Dickerson says — comes from its respective seller. Further, the policy changes allow Etsy businesses to hire as many employees as they deem necessary (including workers in different locations) and allow sellers to ship orders via third-party couriers rather than the post office.[100]
The move has prompted at least one Etsy competitor to distinguish itself by committing never to sell manufactured items.[101]
In September 2015, Etsy made further changes to its manufacturing policy with the launch of Etsy Manufacturing, a marketplace allowing sellers to connect with outside manufacturers to fabricate their products. Manufacturers must be reviewed and approved by Etsy to ensure they adhere to certain criteria, although Etsy will not conduct visits or in-person inspections. Sellers must apply and be approved to work with any partners listed on Etsy Manufacturing and are required to disclose their use of outside manufacturers on their pages.[102]

Etsy is a peer-to-peer (P2P) e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and supplies, as well as unique factory-manufactured items. These items cover a wide range, including art, photography, clothing, jewelry, food, bath and beauty products, quilts, knick-knacks, and toys. Many sellers also sell craft supplies such as beads, wire and jewelry-making tools. All vintage items must be at least 20 years old.[2] The site follows in the tradition of open craft fairs, giving sellers personal storefronts where they list their goods for a fee of US$0.20 per item.[3]
As of December 31, 2014, Etsy had 54 million users registered as members,[4] and the online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods connected 1.4 million active sellers with 19.8 million active buyers.[5] At the end of 2014, Etsy had 685 employees,[6] and had 29 million items listed on its website.[7] In 2014, Etsy clocked a total sales (Gross Merchandise Sales or GMS) of US$1.93 billion on the platform.[4] Of this, 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% was generated outside the USA.[4]
In 2014, Etsy garnered a revenue of US$195.6 million, and registered a net loss of US$15.2 million. Etsy generates revenue primarily from three revenue streams. Its 'Marketplace' revenue includes a fee of 3.5% of sale value, which an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, and a listing fee of 20 cents per item. 'Seller Services', Etsy's fastest growing revenue stream, includes fees for services such as Promoted Listings, payment processing and purchases of shipping labels through the platform. 'Other' revenue includes fees received from third-party payment processors.[8]
In November 2016, Etsy disclosed it purchased Blackbird Technologies for $32.5 million. Blackbird Technologies is a startup that developed AI software used for shopping context - search applications.[9]

History[edit]
2005-2010[edit]




Etsy staff at work, July 2010






Art in the Etsy office in Brooklyn.


The site was launched in 2005[10] by iospace, a small company composed of Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik. The initial version had taken two and a half months to build.[11] Later Jared Tarbell joined the team. Former NPR executive Maria Thomas joined as COO in 2008, was promoted to CEO and left Etsy in December 2009. Robert Kalin resumed his role as CEO from December 2009 until July 2011.[12] Investors include Sean Meenan,[13] Spencer and Judson Ain, Union Square Ventures, and founders of Flickr and Delicious.[14]
Kalin said that he named the site Etsy because he "wanted a nonsense word because I wanted to build the brand from scratch. I was watching Fellini's 8 ½ and writing down what I was hearing. In Italian, you say 'etsi' a lot. It means 'oh, yes' (actually it's "eh, si"). And in Latin and French, it means 'what if.'"[15][16]
In Etsy's first year, it attracted attention for frequently adding new tools and functionality to the site to help sellers gain exposure and traffic, including Adobe Flash-based visualizations and a taxonomy of categories with tags.[17] Etsy passed $1.7 million in sales in May 2007.[18] On July 29, Etsy had its one-millionth sale and anticipated its two-millionth sale would occur mid-December 2007. In November 2007, buyers spent $4.3 million purchasing 300,000 items for sale on Etsy, an increase of 43 percent from October 2007.[3] In June 2007, it expected to be profitable by the fall,[19] but in December 2007 it was not a profitable company.[20] In January 2008, Etsy received an additional $27 million in funding from Union Square Ventures, Hubert Burda Media, and Jim Breyer.[21]
In February 2008, trouble at eBay, including a strike by some dissatisfied sellers, brought speculation that Etsy could be an increasing competitor.[22] At the same time, however, some Etsy sellers expressed unhappiness with how Etsy was handling complaints about stores.[23] At the time, a comparison of the two websites included complaints that on Etsy, items are difficult to find, the interface "feels slow", and the buying and selling process is United States-centric.[24] Other reviewers enjoyed using Etsy's specialized search options,[25][26] including the "Shop Local" tool.[27]
In July 2008, Rob Kalin ceded the position of CEO to Maria Thomas.[28] Some longtime Etsy employees left the company in August 2008, including founders Haim Schoppik and Chris Maguire.[29] In September 2008, Etsy hired Chad Dickerson, who formerly worked at Yahoo!, as Chief Technology Officer.[30] The company acknowledged concerns about vendors selling other people's work as their own.[31]
In April 2009, users organized an "etsyday" promotion on Twitter that brought extra attention to the site.[32] As of May 2009, it had approximately 60 employees and sales of $10 to 13 million per month,[33] possibly boosted by consumer interest in cheaper and more personalized goods due to the United States recession.[34]
In March 2011, Etsy "introduced a Facebook-style social networking system called People Search...to help buyers and sellers connect with each other and become friends". By doing so, Etsy made any past purchase with feedback easily searchable, which caused many complaints. Etsy then made changes to the site to better guard information regarding users' purchases.[35]
IPO and investor lawsuit[edit]
In March 2010, Kalin said that the company is profitable and "plans to go public, though not until at least next year."[36] Financial statements required to be filed by Etsy in order to go public show that due to reinvestment of annually increasing gross profits in marketing, product development, and management, the company has not reported a net profit as of 2015.[37]
In December 2010, Etsy said it had seven million registered users, and that it would continue to focus on a personal community feel as it grows larger, as that is part of what distinguishes it from eBay.[38]
On March 3, 2015, Etsy announced that it had filed for a $100 million USD IPO.[6][39] As of 2015, Etsy generated transactions worth US$1.93 billion on its platform, which has 54 million members.[40] Etsy went public on April 16, 2015. The company's valuation was $1.8 billion and raised $237 million in IPO proceeds.[41] Less than a month later, Etsy stock dropped more than 8%. The stock closed at $30 on its first day of trading on April 16 and dropped down to $20.32 as of May 11.[42]
Shortly after the IPO in 2015, a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Etsy claiming fraud. The suit claimed that Etsy's CEO and officers failed to disclose numerous problems with the site which could affect the stock price, among them that "more than 5 percent of all merchandise for sale on Etsy’s website may be either counterfeit or constitute trademark or copyright infringement” and that “brands are increasingly pursuing sellers on Etsy for trademark or copyright infringement, jeopardizing listing fees and commissions." The suit also claimed that Etsy management knew of the rampant trademark and copyright infringement but did little to stop it, and in fact worked to hide this information from potential invenstors.[43]
2011-2017[edit]
In July 2011, Chad Dickerson, CTO since September 2008, became CEO, upon the firing of Rob Kalin. Later CTOs were Kellan Elliot-McCrea and John Allspaw.[44]
In April 2012, a newspaper article about Etsy covered its fraud detection efforts;[45] Etsy had been criticized in the past for inconsistently applying its rules about items having to be handmade.[46] Later in April 2012, the writer of Regretsy, a popular blog, did independent research into a specific featured vendor, Ecologica Malibu, and found evidence to accuse the vendor of being a reseller, which would be against the Etsy Terms of Service.[47] The vendor asserted that it was in line with the Terms of Service, stating that the shop had simply failed to identify itself as a "collective" that included the work of several individuals, and many Etsy community members posted on the Etsy forum expressing unhappiness with the action (or lack of action) taken by Etsy.[48] As of June 2012, the vendor's account is no longer active on Etsy.[49]
In May 2012, Etsy raised $40 million in Series F funding, and announced the company had become B Corporation certified.[50] This funding is partly going toward expanding Etsy in international markets, including France, Germany, and Australia.[51]
On October 1, 2013, Dickerson held an online Town Hall Meeting to announce that Etsy would now permit factory-made goods and drop shipping, provided the seller either designed or hired designers of the items, disclosed to Etsy their factory, disclosed that they used factories and took "ownership" of the process. In that meeting and afterward, Etsy claimed the meaning of the word "handmade" should be redefined to encompass factory made.[52]
In September 2016, Etsy announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup, Blackbird Technologies.[53] Etsy Inc. after experience a first-quarter loss in May 2017, replaced its chief executive and cut 8% of its workforce. Board member Josh Silverman was appointed CEO over Chad Dickerson.[54]
In May 2017, the company's board replaced Dickerson as CEO with Josh Silverman, citing pressure from shareholders and poor profits.[55]
Main features[edit]
Selling[edit]
A variety of products are sold on Etsy, including arts supplies, handmade products and vintage pieces. Vintage pieces can only be listed if they are a minimum of 20 years old. In order to sell products on Etsy, users must create a username and have the option to create a shop name. The username cannot be changed once created. Creating a shop on Etsy is free, however each listing that is posted in the shop costs $0.20. Each listing will remain on the shop's page for 4 months, or until someone buys the product. The sale prices of products are determined by the shop owner, but Etsy claims 3.5% of the sale price of each listing. Shop owners are sent a bill at the end of every month containing the fees they owe, and they have until the 15th day of the following month to pay the Etsy bill.[56] Since on-line sign-up appears for every region internationally, Etsy provides a global shipping feature.[57]
Buying[edit]
Searching for products to buy on Etsy is generally intuitive and simple. On the homepage, potential buyers can type a product description into the search bar,[58] or they can "Browse" through a list of options on the left side of the homepage, which include Art, Home & Living, Jewelry, Women, Men, Kids, Vintage, Weddings, Craft Supplies, Trending Items, Gift Ideas, Mobile Accessories, and more.[59] Alternatively, buyers may choose from a list of categories by clicking on the "Categories" link under "More Ways to Shop". This will bring the user to a page of over 30 categories, each containing sub-categories.[60]
When a buyer views a product, he/she can view the positive percentage feedback of each seller to determine the reliability of the shop. Once a buyer finds a product he/she would like to buy, he/she clicks "Add to Cart", and that product is added to his/her virtual "Shopping Cart". The buyer may then continue shopping or purchase the selected item. In order to purchase items, buyers must have an account with Etsy. The account is free and can be integrated with Facebook. The total product and shipping costs are shown to the user prior to entering payment information so the user knows exactly how much is being paid. Sellers choose which payment options to offer buyers; options include credit/debit cards and PayPal, among others.[61]
Buyers should be aware that Etsy has a very poor record in protecting customer data and privacy.[62] As of 2016, according to the Privacy Policy Section on the Etsy website ; " By using Etsy, you authorise Etsy to use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where Etsy operates " .[63]
Operations[edit]




Etsy Labs community workspace area.


Etsy is popular as a side-business[64] as well as a place to buy goods made from recycled and upcycled materials,[65] along with less expensive or more unusual versions of mass-produced items.[66] The unique nature of many of the items for sale is part of their appeal to some shoppers.[67][68] Product photos on Etsy tend to be editorial or artistic instead of commercial catalog style.[69] Sellers can add tags to their products to help buyers find them,[70] and buyers can choose to search for items available locally.[71] Etsy staffers publish lists of featured items.[72]
Etsy makes money by charging a listing fee of USD 0.20 for each item and getting 3.5% of every sale,[73] with the average sale about $15 or $20. Most sellers are women[19] who tend to be college-educated and in their twenties and thirties.[33] Individual Etsy sellers decide which payment options to offer buyers; these options may include credit card, check, money order, PayPal, bank transfer, and Etsy gift card.[74][75]
Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional artists who use the site to make a living.[76] According to artists who have developed their Etsy stores into their primary jobs, scaling up production of handmade items can require more than full-time work,[77] especially during the holiday shopping season.[78]
Etsy's main office is located in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and it has hosted open crafting classes in the "Etsy Labs".[79] The site's technology, customer support, marketing/PR, business, and communications teams operate out of this office. Etsy Labs has a workspace that provides equipment and donated materials where members gather to make items, take and teach workshops, and attend special events.[3] Etsy also has an office in Berlin.[80] In April 2012, Etsy announced that it was taking steps to hire more women engineers to improve the gender balance of its team, as a website with majority women users but few women engineers.[81]
Etsy was one of the main members of the Handmade Consortium, a 2007 effort to encourage buying handmade holiday gifts.[20] Etsy has partnered with the retail chain West Elm to sell some Etsy products in its stores.[82][83] In December 2012, Etsy opened a temporary holiday storefront in SoHo, New York City.[78]
Ethos[edit]
In an interview in August 2013, CEO Chad Dickerson emphasized the importance of human interaction and meaning from creativity in regard to his perspective on Etsy. Dickerson described the website as "a platform that provides meaning to people, and an opportunity to validate their art, their craft", and after spending time with Etsy users, Dickerson learned that "all commerce is about real human interaction". Dickerson also provided a summation of Etsy that is a further reflection of the company's relationship- and meaning-based ethos: "At the end of every transaction, you get something real from a real person. There is an existential satisfaction to that."[84]
Competitors[edit]
As of March, 2016, Etsy's top three competitors according to Hoovers Online are Amazon Handmade, Craigslist, and eBay.[85] Etsy has been compared to "a crafty cross between Amazon and eBay",[18] and to "your grandma's basement".[86] Etsy also has a number of direct competitors. DaWanda, based in Germany, focuses on growing in European countries.[87] ezebee.com, based in Switzerland, is a global competitor, but also caters to freelancers and professionals[88] Bonanza (formerly Bonanzle and 1000 Markets[89]) is based in the United States and focuses on clothing and fashion, Zibbet and Made It which are based in Australia, iCraft is based in Canada,[90] Artfire is based in the United States,[91] and Hello Pretty is an online craft marketplace targeted at South Africans.[92] Tindie is based in Portland, Oregon, and focuses on technology and electronics.[93]
Asked about competitors, Etsy's European CEO said, "As far as I am concerned, the more people highlighting the value of supporting micro-producers and buying handmade and vintage directly from them, the better."[94]
Seller issues[edit]
Privacy[edit]
In an effort to add social networking features to Etsy, the company implemented features in 2011 that allowed users to search other users' buying histories and to trace their purchasing transactions. Etsy thought that this feature would allow Etsy users to connect to individuals with similar buying and/or selling histories and an automatic opt-in was applied to all users without the attainment of prior permission. Users of the service raised concerns over the feature's violation of privacy rights, but an official response was not released by the company.[95]
Ecologica Malibu[edit]
In April 2012, some Etsy users began requesting the removal of Ecologica Malibu from the website due to the shop's use of a wholesale manufacturer. Users complained that Ecologica Malibu's practice was contradictory to the anti-big business values of Etsy.[96] CEO Chad Dickerson responded in an Etsy blog post:

Much of the information we learn from investigations can’t be shared with the larger community out of respect for the privacy of the seller being investigated, so there is a natural divergence between what the community sees when they report a seller and what we see as we go deeper on the case. … [T]here are times when available public evidence suggests that a violation of our policy is clear, and our investigations find that it’s actually not the case.[97]

Many users are still not content with Dickerson's response.[98]
Production outsourcing[edit]
On Oct 1, 2013, Etsy changed its policy to allow sellers to outsource production to third parties and factories and to use shipping or fulfillment services.[99] The new rules allow products to be labeled "handmade" as long as the original idea for that item — or its "authorship" as C.E.O. Dickerson says — comes from its respective seller. Further, the policy changes allow Etsy businesses to hire as many employees as they deem necessary (including workers in different locations) and allow sellers to ship orders via third-party couriers rather than the post office.[100]
The move has prompted at least one Etsy competitor to distinguish itself by committing never to sell manufactured items.[101]
In September 2015, Etsy made further changes to its manufacturing policy with the launch of Etsy Manufacturing, a marketplace allowing sellers to connect with outside manufacturers to fabricate their products. Manufacturers must be reviewed and approved by Etsy to ensure they adhere to certain criteria, although Etsy will not conduct visits or in-person inspections. Sellers must apply and be approved to work with any partners listed on Etsy Manufacturing and are required to disclose their use of outside manufacturers on their pages.[102]

Etsy is a peer-to-peer (P2P) e-commerce website focused on handmade or vintage items and supplies, as well as unique factory-manufactured items. These items cover a wide range, including art, photography, clothing, jewelry, food, bath and beauty products, quilts, knick-knacks, and toys. Many sellers also sell craft supplies such as beads, wire and jewelry-making tools. All vintage items must be at least 20 years old.[2] The site follows in the tradition of open craft fairs, giving sellers personal storefronts where they list their goods for a fee of US$0.20 per item.[3]
As of December 31, 2014, Etsy had 54 million users registered as members,[4] and the online marketplace for handmade and vintage goods connected 1.4 million active sellers with 19.8 million active buyers.[5] At the end of 2014, Etsy had 685 employees,[6] and had 29 million items listed on its website.[7] In 2014, Etsy clocked a total sales (Gross Merchandise Sales or GMS) of US$1.93 billion on the platform.[4] Of this, 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% was generated outside the USA.[4]
In 2014, Etsy garnered a revenue of US$195.6 million, and registered a net loss of US$15.2 million. Etsy generates revenue primarily from three revenue streams. Its 'Marketplace' revenue includes a fee of 3.5% of sale value, which an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction, and a listing fee of 20 cents per item. 'Seller Services', Etsy's fastest growing revenue stream, includes fees for services such as Promoted Listings, payment processing and purchases of shipping labels through the platform. 'Other' revenue includes fees received from third-party payment processors.[8]
In November 2016, Etsy disclosed it purchased Blackbird Technologies for $32.5 million. Blackbird Technologies is a startup that developed AI software used for shopping context - search applications.[9]

History[edit]
2005-2010[edit]




Etsy staff at work, July 2010






Art in the Etsy office in Brooklyn.


The site was launched in 2005[10] by iospace, a small company composed of Robert Kalin, Chris Maguire, and Haim Schoppik. The initial version had taken two and a half months to build.[11] Later Jared Tarbell joined the team. Former NPR executive Maria Thomas joined as COO in 2008, was promoted to CEO and left Etsy in December 2009. Robert Kalin resumed his role as CEO from December 2009 until July 2011.[12] Investors include Sean Meenan,[13] Spencer and Judson Ain, Union Square Ventures, and founders of Flickr and Delicious.[14]
Kalin said that he named the site Etsy because he "wanted a nonsense word because I wanted to build the brand from scratch. I was watching Fellini's 8 ½ and writing down what I was hearing. In Italian, you say 'etsi' a lot. It means 'oh, yes' (actually it's "eh, si"). And in Latin and French, it means 'what if.'"[15][16]
In Etsy's first year, it attracted attention for frequently adding new tools and functionality to the site to help sellers gain exposure and traffic, including Adobe Flash-based visualizations and a taxonomy of categories with tags.[17] Etsy passed $1.7 million in sales in May 2007.[18] On July 29, Etsy had its one-millionth sale and anticipated its two-millionth sale would occur mid-December 2007. In November 2007, buyers spent $4.3 million purchasing 300,000 items for sale on Etsy, an increase of 43 percent from October 2007.[3] In June 2007, it expected to be profitable by the fall,[19] but in December 2007 it was not a profitable company.[20] In January 2008, Etsy received an additional $27 million in funding from Union Square Ventures, Hubert Burda Media, and Jim Breyer.[21]
In February 2008, trouble at eBay, including a strike by some dissatisfied sellers, brought speculation that Etsy could be an increasing competitor.[22] At the same time, however, some Etsy sellers expressed unhappiness with how Etsy was handling complaints about stores.[23] At the time, a comparison of the two websites included complaints that on Etsy, items are difficult to find, the interface "feels slow", and the buying and selling process is United States-centric.[24] Other reviewers enjoyed using Etsy's specialized search options,[25][26] including the "Shop Local" tool.[27]
In July 2008, Rob Kalin ceded the position of CEO to Maria Thomas.[28] Some longtime Etsy employees left the company in August 2008, including founders Haim Schoppik and Chris Maguire.[29] In September 2008, Etsy hired Chad Dickerson, who formerly worked at Yahoo!, as Chief Technology Officer.[30] The company acknowledged concerns about vendors selling other people's work as their own.[31]
In April 2009, users organized an "etsyday" promotion on Twitter that brought extra attention to the site.[32] As of May 2009, it had approximately 60 employees and sales of $10 to 13 million per month,[33] possibly boosted by consumer interest in cheaper and more personalized goods due to the United States recession.[34]
In March 2011, Etsy "introduced a Facebook-style social networking system called People Search...to help buyers and sellers connect with each other and become friends". By doing so, Etsy made any past purchase with feedback easily searchable, which caused many complaints. Etsy then made changes to the site to better guard information regarding users' purchases.[35]
IPO and investor lawsuit[edit]
In March 2010, Kalin said that the company is profitable and "plans to go public, though not until at least next year."[36] Financial statements required to be filed by Etsy in order to go public show that due to reinvestment of annually increasing gross profits in marketing, product development, and management, the company has not reported a net profit as of 2015.[37]
In December 2010, Etsy said it had seven million registered users, and that it would continue to focus on a personal community feel as it grows larger, as that is part of what distinguishes it from eBay.[38]
On March 3, 2015, Etsy announced that it had filed for a $100 million USD IPO.[6][39] As of 2015, Etsy generated transactions worth US$1.93 billion on its platform, which has 54 million members.[40] Etsy went public on April 16, 2015. The company's valuation was $1.8 billion and raised $237 million in IPO proceeds.[41] Less than a month later, Etsy stock dropped more than 8%. The stock closed at $30 on its first day of trading on April 16 and dropped down to $20.32 as of May 11.[42]
Shortly after the IPO in 2015, a group of investors filed a class action lawsuit against Etsy claiming fraud. The suit claimed that Etsy's CEO and officers failed to disclose numerous problems with the site which could affect the stock price, among them that "more than 5 percent of all merchandise for sale on Etsy’s website may be either counterfeit or constitute trademark or copyright infringement” and that “brands are increasingly pursuing sellers on Etsy for trademark or copyright infringement, jeopardizing listing fees and commissions." The suit also claimed that Etsy management knew of the rampant trademark and copyright infringement but did little to stop it, and in fact worked to hide this information from potential invenstors.[43]
2011-2017[edit]
In July 2011, Chad Dickerson, CTO since September 2008, became CEO, upon the firing of Rob Kalin. Later CTOs were Kellan Elliot-McCrea and John Allspaw.[44]
In April 2012, a newspaper article about Etsy covered its fraud detection efforts;[45] Etsy had been criticized in the past for inconsistently applying its rules about items having to be handmade.[46] Later in April 2012, the writer of Regretsy, a popular blog, did independent research into a specific featured vendor, Ecologica Malibu, and found evidence to accuse the vendor of being a reseller, which would be against the Etsy Terms of Service.[47] The vendor asserted that it was in line with the Terms of Service, stating that the shop had simply failed to identify itself as a "collective" that included the work of several individuals, and many Etsy community members posted on the Etsy forum expressing unhappiness with the action (or lack of action) taken by Etsy.[48] As of June 2012, the vendor's account is no longer active on Etsy.[49]
In May 2012, Etsy raised $40 million in Series F funding, and announced the company had become B Corporation certified.[50] This funding is partly going toward expanding Etsy in international markets, including France, Germany, and Australia.[51]
On October 1, 2013, Dickerson held an online Town Hall Meeting to announce that Etsy would now permit factory-made goods and drop shipping, provided the seller either designed or hired designers of the items, disclosed to Etsy their factory, disclosed that they used factories and took "ownership" of the process. In that meeting and afterward, Etsy claimed the meaning of the word "handmade" should be redefined to encompass factory made.[52]
In September 2016, Etsy announced the acquisition of artificial intelligence startup, Blackbird Technologies.[53] Etsy Inc. after experience a first-quarter loss in May 2017, replaced its chief executive and cut 8% of its workforce. Board member Josh Silverman was appointed CEO over Chad Dickerson.[54]
In May 2017, the company's board replaced Dickerson as CEO with Josh Silverman, citing pressure from shareholders and poor profits.[55]
Main features[edit]
Selling[edit]
A variety of products are sold on Etsy, including arts supplies, handmade products and vintage pieces. Vintage pieces can only be listed if they are a minimum of 20 years old. In order to sell products on Etsy, users must create a username and have the option to create a shop name. The username cannot be changed once created. Creating a shop on Etsy is free, however each listing that is posted in the shop costs $0.20. Each listing will remain on the shop's page for 4 months, or until someone buys the product. The sale prices of products are determined by the shop owner, but Etsy claims 3.5% of the sale price of each listing. Shop owners are sent a bill at the end of every month containing the fees they owe, and they have until the 15th day of the following month to pay the Etsy bill.[56] Since on-line sign-up appears for every region internationally, Etsy provides a global shipping feature.[57]
Buying[edit]
Searching for products to buy on Etsy is generally intuitive and simple. On the homepage, potential buyers can type a product description into the search bar,[58] or they can "Browse" through a list of options on the left side of the homepage, which include Art, Home & Living, Jewelry, Women, Men, Kids, Vintage, Weddings, Craft Supplies, Trending Items, Gift Ideas, Mobile Accessories, and more.[59] Alternatively, buyers may choose from a list of categories by clicking on the "Categories" link under "More Ways to Shop". This will bring the user to a page of over 30 categories, each containing sub-categories.[60]
When a buyer views a product, he/she can view the positive percentage feedback of each seller to determine the reliability of the shop. Once a buyer finds a product he/she would like to buy, he/she clicks "Add to Cart", and that product is added to his/her virtual "Shopping Cart". The buyer may then continue shopping or purchase the selected item. In order to purchase items, buyers must have an account with Etsy. The account is free and can be integrated with Facebook. The total product and shipping costs are shown to the user prior to entering payment information so the user knows exactly how much is being paid. Sellers choose which payment options to offer buyers; options include credit/debit cards and PayPal, among others.[61]
Buyers should be aware that Etsy has a very poor record in protecting customer data and privacy.[62] As of 2016, according to the Privacy Policy Section on the Etsy website ; " By using Etsy, you authorise Etsy to use your information in the United States, Ireland and any other country where Etsy operates " .[63]
Operations[edit]




Etsy Labs community workspace area.


Etsy is popular as a side-business[64] as well as a place to buy goods made from recycled and upcycled materials,[65] along with less expensive or more unusual versions of mass-produced items.[66] The unique nature of many of the items for sale is part of their appeal to some shoppers.[67][68] Product photos on Etsy tend to be editorial or artistic instead of commercial catalog style.[69] Sellers can add tags to their products to help buyers find them,[70] and buyers can choose to search for items available locally.[71] Etsy staffers publish lists of featured items.[72]
Etsy makes money by charging a listing fee of USD 0.20 for each item and getting 3.5% of every sale,[73] with the average sale about $15 or $20. Most sellers are women[19] who tend to be college-educated and in their twenties and thirties.[33] Individual Etsy sellers decide which payment options to offer buyers; these options may include credit card, check, money order, PayPal, bank transfer, and Etsy gift card.[74][75]
Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional artists who use the site to make a living.[76] According to artists who have developed their Etsy stores into their primary jobs, scaling up production of handmade items can require more than full-time work,[77] especially during the holiday shopping season.[78]
Etsy's main office is located in Dumbo, Brooklyn, and it has hosted open crafting classes in the "Etsy Labs".[79] The site's technology, customer support, marketing/PR, business, and communications teams operate out of this office. Etsy Labs has a workspace that provides equipment and donated materials where members gather to make items, take and teach workshops, and attend special events.[3] Etsy also has an office in Berlin.[80] In April 2012, Etsy announced that it was taking steps to hire more women engineers to improve the gender balance of its team, as a website with majority women users but few women engineers.[81]
Etsy was one of the main members of the Handmade Consortium, a 2007 effort to encourage buying handmade holiday gifts.[20] Etsy has partnered with the retail chain West Elm to sell some Etsy products in its stores.[82][83] In December 2012, Etsy opened a temporary holiday storefront in SoHo, New York City.[78]
Ethos[edit]
In an interview in August 2013, CEO Chad Dickerson emphasized the importance of human interaction and meaning from creativity in regard to his perspective on Etsy. Dickerson described the website as "a platform that provides meaning to people, and an opportunity to validate their art, their craft", and after spending time with Etsy users, Dickerson learned that "all commerce is about real human interaction". Dickerson also provided a summation of Etsy that is a further reflection of the company's relationship- and meaning-based ethos: "At the end of every transaction, you get something real from a real person. There is an existential satisfaction to that."[84]
Competitors[edit]
As of March, 2016, Etsy's top three competitors according to Hoovers Online are Amazon Handmade, Craigslist, and eBay.[85] Etsy has been compared to "a crafty cross between Amazon and eBay",[18] and to "your grandma's basement".[86] Etsy also has a number of direct competitors. DaWanda, based in Germany, focuses on growing in European countries.[87] ezebee.com, based in Switzerland, is a global competitor, but also caters to freelancers and professionals[88] Bonanza (formerly Bonanzle and 1000 Markets[89]) is based in the United States and focuses on clothing and fashion, Zibbet and Made It which are based in Australia, iCraft is based in Canada,[90] Artfire is based in the United States,[91] and Hello Pretty is an online craft marketplace targeted at South Africans.[92] Tindie is based in Portland, Oregon, and focuses on technology and electronics.[93]
Asked about competitors, Etsy's European CEO said, "As far as I am concerned, the more people highlighting the value of supporting micro-producers and buying handmade and vintage directly from them, the better."[94]
Seller issues[edit]
Privacy[edit]
In an effort to add social networking features to Etsy, the company implemented features in 2011 that allowed users to search other users' buying histories and to trace their purchasing transactions. Etsy thought that this feature would allow Etsy users to connect to individuals with similar buying and/or selling histories and an automatic opt-in was applied to all users without the attainment of prior permission. Users of the service raised concerns over the feature's violation of privacy rights, but an official response was not released by the company.[95]
Ecologica Malibu[edit]
In April 2012, some Etsy users began requesting the removal of Ecologica Malibu from the website due to the shop's use of a wholesale manufacturer. Users complained that Ecologica Malibu's practice was contradictory to the anti-big business values of Etsy.[96] CEO Chad Dickerson responded in an Etsy blog post:

Much of the information we learn from investigations can’t be shared with the larger community out of respect for the privacy of the seller being investigated, so there is a natural divergence between what the community sees when they report a seller and what we see as we go deeper on the case. … [T]here are times when available public evidence suggests that a violation of our policy is clear, and our investigations find that it’s actually not the case.[97]

Many users are still not content with Dickerson's response.[98]
Production outsourcing[edit]
On Oct 1, 2013, Etsy changed its policy to allow sellers to outsource production to third parties and factories and to use shipping or fulfillment services.[99] The new rules allow products to be labeled "handmade" as long as the original idea for that item — or its "authorship" as C.E.O. Dickerson says — comes from its respective seller. Further, the policy changes allow Etsy businesses to hire as many employees as they deem necessary (including workers in different locations) and allow sellers to ship orders via third-party couriers rather than the post office.[100]
The move has prompted at least one Etsy competitor to distinguish itself by committing never to sell manufactured items.[101]
In September 2015, Etsy made further changes to its manufacturing policy with the launch of Etsy Manufacturing, a marketplace allowing sellers to connect with outside manufacturers to fabricate their products. Manufacturers must be reviewed and approved by Etsy to ensure they adhere to certain criteria, although Etsy will not conduct visits or in-person inspections. Sellers must apply and be approved to work with any partners listed on Etsy Manufacturing and are required to disclose their use of outside manufacturers on their pages.[102]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Etsy, Inc. Reports First Quarter 2017 Financial ResultsAnnounces CEO Transition

BROOKLYN, N.Y., May 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Etsy, Inc. (NASDAQ: ETSY), which builds markets, services and economic opportunity for creative entrepreneurs, today announced financial results for its first quarter, ended March 31, 2017.Senior Leadership TransitionThe Company also announced that the Etsy Board of Directors has appointed Josh Silverman, a director on the Board since November 2016, as CEO, effective May 3, 2017. Josh succeeds Chad Dickerson, who will step down as CEO and Chair of the Board of Directors. Chad will serve in an advisory role to the Company through May 31, 2017. Fred Wilson, who joined the Etsy Board in June 2007 and has served as lead independent director since October 2014, will succeed Chad as Chair of the Board.As the new CEO of Etsy, Josh has two decades of product development, marketing and e-commerce expertise. His deep industry experience includes leading and growing consumer technology companies and scaling global marketplaces. Josh previously served as President of Consumer Products and Services at American Express. Before American Express, Josh was CEO of Skype, CEO of shopping.com, an eBay company, and held various executive roles at eBay. He was also a co-founder and CEO of Evite, Inc. and he currently serves on the board of directors of Shake Shack.Fred said, "Etsy is very fortunate to have Josh stepping into the CEO role at this time. He brings twenty years of senior leadership in technology and marketplace businesses to Etsy. In the six months that Josh has been on our Board, we have gotten to know him well and he has gotten to know us well. That will make for an easier transition and faster execution. I am pleased to be appointed Chair of the Etsy Board and I am looking forward to working closely with Josh and the leadership team to help Etsy capitalize on its significant growth opportunities."Fred added, "On behalf of the Board and the entire Etsy team, I want to thank Chad for building Etsy into the wonderful company that it is. Over the last six years as CEO, Chad has transformed a chaotic startup into a world class company, and in the process grew the revenues our sellers make over nine times, the revenues Etsy generates almost fourteen times and the operating profit Etsy generates almost fifteen times. And in doing that, Chad never lost sight of the original vision and the unique culture that makes Etsy the very best home for creative entrepreneurs. We have benefited greatly from his leadership."Josh said, "I have a deep appreciation for the mission of Etsy and the unique role that it plays in global e-commerce. Our focus will remain on delivering value to our community, including our shareholders. Having worked at other marketplaces, I recognize how difficult it is to create a differentiated value proposition for buyers that provides a unique opportunity for sellers—and Etsy has done that. In the coming weeks, I look forward to listening and learning from our employees, sellers, buyers and shareholders to help ensure we are focusing on the most value-enhancing near- and long-term opportunities."Chad said, "It has been an honor to lead Etsy as CEO for the past six years and the three years before that as CTO. The Board decided that it was time for new leadership to take Etsy forward and I support that decision. I deeply admire and respect each and every person on the Etsy team who has worked so hard during my tenure to deliver a great experience for Etsy buyers and economic empowerment for creative entrepreneurs around the world. I have the greatest degree of confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for Etsy under Josh's leadership. I wish the company and the community the greatest success and look forward to supporting the global community of Etsy sellers as a regular buyer after the transition."In addition, the Company also announced that John Allspaw, Chief Technology Officer, will be leaving the Company and Mike Brittain, VP of Engineering, will be named interim CTO. Mr. Allspaw will serve in an advisory role to the Company through May 31, 2017. First Quarter 2017 Financial Summary(in thousands except percentages; unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,% Growth Y/Y20162017GMS$     629,853$     719,03714.2%Revenue$       81,847$       96,89118.4%Markets revenue$       35,730$       40,75914.1%Seller Services revenue$       43,533$       53,94723.9%Net income (loss)$         1,192$          (421)(135.3%)Adjusted EBITDA$       14,751$         9,722(34.1%)Active sellers1,6031,80112.4%Active buyers25,02729,66918.5%Percent mobile visits63%66%300 bpsPercent mobile GMS47%51%400 bpsPercent international GMS30.3%32.1%180 bps For information about how we define our metrics, see our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.First Quarter 2017 Operational Highlights "During the first quarter, we laid the groundwork for key initiatives and launches that will enhance Etsy's capabilities and offerings for sellers and buyers, strengthen the brand and help position Etsy for long-term growth," continued Chad. "Etsy is actively investing in machine learning, search and marketing to attract new buyers and drive purchase frequency. Additionally, we just completed the successful launch of Etsy Studio. Although a challenging February contributed to lower than anticipated first quarter results, I am confident that the fundamental strength of Etsy's business and its unique competitive position will drive long-term growth for all stakeholders."GMS was $719.0 million, up 14.2% compared with the first quarter of 2016. On a currency-neutral basis (excluding the direct impact of currency translation on GMS from goods that are not listed in U.S. dollars) GMS growth in the first quarter of 2017 would have been 15.2%. Growth in GMS was supported by 12.4% year-over-year growth in active sellers and 18.5% year-over-year growth in active buyers. Continuing the trend we've seen for multiple quarters, mobile visits once again grew faster than desktop visits. Percent mobile visits was approximately 66% compared with approximately 63% in the first quarter of 2016 and approximately 65% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Percent mobile GMS was approximately 51% compared with 47% in the first quarter of 2016 and 49% in the fourth quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, mobile GMS was more than 50% of overall GMS for the first time. Specifically, mobile web was the largest contributor to both overall visits as well as mobile GMS. Year-over-year aggregate conversion rate increased, despite the growing contribution of mobile web, which carries the lowest conversion rate of any device. In addition, conversion rate on every device - desktop, mobile web and mobile app - increased for the sixth consecutive quarter. During the first quarter, the year-over-year growth in mobile conversion rates led to a slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile GMS. Mobile app and mobile web GMS each continued to grow significantly faster than desktop GMS during the first quarter.Percent international GMS was 32.1% in the first quarter of 2017, up from 30.3% in the first quarter of 2016, and up sequentially from 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Notably, international GMS growth accelerated year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter.During the first quarter of 2017, percent international GMS was largely driven by continued robust GMS growth between U.S. buyers and international sellers and GMS growth between buyers and sellers outside of the U.S., both in the same country and cross-border. GMS growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international GMS, growing 44% year-over-year during the first quarter. We believe the robust growth in this category demonstrates the progress we are making in building and deepening local Etsy communities around the world. GMS between U.S. sellers and international buyers declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter, an improvement from the trends we experienced in 2015 and 2016. Expense Reductions and Resource RealignmentLate last year, Etsy realigned its teams to better support the evolving needs of our business. This has resulted in strengthened cross-functional collaboration, increased accountability and faster execution. Building on this foundation, early in the second quarter of 2017, we also looked for opportunities to increase efficiency and streamline our cost structure. As a result of this process, we have identified savings that will be realized through a combination of headcount reductions and a reduction in internal program expenses. In total, we expect to eliminate approximately 80 positions, which is approximately 8% of the total workforce.Chad commented, "Today, we announced an expense reduction and realignment initiative to help position Etsy for growth. Etsy's business has evolved significantly over the past 12 years and, while decisions like these are never easy, the Board is confident that this initiative will give the Company greater focus and agility in the near term, while allowing the Company to continue expanding in key growth areas. I wish everyone who was affected the absolute best in whatever they choose to do next."Recent Operational HighlightsOur product roadmap is focused on supporting sellers as they start, manage and scale their businesses and enhancing the buyer experience. Recent highlights include:Etsy Studio launchLast week, we launched Etsy Studio. Etsy Studio is the first new market that we've built since 2005 and will disrupt the global craft buying and selling experience. By offering a differentiated and category specific buyer experience we believe Etsy Studio will allow us to gain share in the large addressable craft supplies market. On Etsy Studio at the time of launch, our global craft sellers offered nearly eight million items to buyers around the world.Product launchesWe are using machine learning to make category-specific suggestions to improve the listing process and collect more accurate data. Our efforts around Structured Data will enable us to collect more attributes and information from sellers during the listing process so we can offer more advanced and relevant search filters and deliver more personalized recommendations. This will allow buyers to more quickly find the exact items for which they are searching.
We recently updated our Direct Checkout payment service and rebranded it as Etsy Payments. Our ultimate goal with Etsy Payments is to offer all Etsy sellers and buyers one unified payments platform. For sellers, Etsy Payments offers a more flexible and easy way to manage how and when they receive payments and deposits. Buyers have access to 10 different payment options, including Android Pay for mobile app, launched in March. Additionally, our recent launches of Multi-Shop Checkout and Guest Checkout enable buyers to seamlessly purchase from multiple sellers in one transaction and check out without being signed into an Etsy account, respectively. We believe these collective enhancements can drive conversion and GMS growth by reducing friction in the checkout process.Creating a unified business management offering for sellersSince our February launch of Shop Manager, a centralized hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their Etsy business, we have received positive feedback from a number of sellers using the new platform. We believe this was an important step towards building a unified business management offering to help our sellers start, manage and scale their businesses. Shop Manager showcases the breadth and depth of our services and tools in one convenient place, which we believe can help encourage seller service adoption.First Quarter 2017 Financial HighlightsTotal revenue was $96.9 million, up 18.4% year-over-year, driven by growth in both Markets and Seller Services revenue. Markets revenue grew 14.1%, driven by growth in transaction fee revenue and, to a lesser extent, growth in listing fee revenue. Seller Services revenue grew 23.9% year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue growth in Etsy Payments. Seller Services revenue also benefited from revenue growth in Promoted Listings and, to a lesser extent, Pattern by Etsy and Shipping Labels. Gross profit for the first quarter was $62.2 million, up 15.4% year-over-year and gross margin was 64.2%, down 170 bps compared with 65.9% in the first quarter of 2016. Total operating expenses were $64.3 million in the first quarter, up 36.4% year-over-year, and represented 66.4% of revenue, up from 57.6% of revenue in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue is primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses and marketing expenses related to our brand campaign. During the first quarter, marketing expenses were $23.5 million, up 48.0% year-over-year and represented 24.2% of revenue compared with 19.4% in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by brand marketing spend, mostly on YouTube and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, digital acquisition marketing (which excludes brand marketing-related spend on YouTube and Facebook) and employee-related expenses. Digital acquisition marketing spend increased 25.9% year-over-year during the first quarter. Product development expenses were $18.1 million, up 48.1% year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related costs including additional expenses resulting from the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies. Product development expenses increased as a percent of revenue to 18.7% compared with 14.9% in the first quarter of 2016.G&A expenses were $22.8 million, up 19.3% year-over-year driven by increased employee-related expenses, partially offset by lower professional services expenses and post-combination stock compensation expense related to the acquisition of ALM year-over-year. G&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to 23.5% compared with roughly 23.3% in the first quarter of 2016. Based on build-to-suit accounting requirements, we recognized $0.8 million and $2.1 million in incremental depreciation and non-cash interest expense, respectively, in the first quarter related to our new headquarters, as expected. For more information on the cash impact of our build-to-suit lease agreement, please refer to "Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $0.4 million, compared with net income of $1.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Etsy's net loss in the first quarter of 2017 included interest expense associated with the build-to-suit lease accounting related to our new headquarters, a $2.8 million foreign exchange gain and an income tax benefit of $1.1 million, all primarily non-cash. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $9.7 million, and declined 34.1% year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 10.0%, down 800 bps year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA performance was driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses and an increase in marketing expenses as a percent of revenue.Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared with $2.8 million in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was mainly driven by revenue growth. Cash, marketable securities and short-term investments were $276.0 million as of March 31, 2017.Financial GuidanceIn light of the leadership transition, Etsy's new management team will review the Company's 2017 guidance.

Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform.We believe that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense;
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us;
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain;
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest expense; and
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net income (loss) and our other GAAP results.     Reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands; unaudited)Three Months Ended March 31,20162017Net income (loss)$            1,192$             (421)Excluding:Interest and other non-operating expense, net (1)972,152Provision (benefit) for income taxes13,614(1,052)Depreciation and amortization (1)4,7316,938Stock-based compensation expense (2)2,5814,043Stock-based compensation expense—acquisitions (2)656842Foreign exchange gain(8,120)(2,780)Adjusted EBITDA$         14,751$           9,722(1) Included in interest and depreciation expense amounts above, interest and depreciation expense related to our headquarters under build-to-suit accounting requirements, which commenced in May 2016, in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2017 is as follows (in thousands): Three Months Ended March 31,20162017Interest expense$                  -$          2,145Depreciation-819(2) Total stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows (in thousands):Three Months Ended March 31,20162017Cost of revenue$               200$              364Marketing178444Product development8572,020General and administrative2,0022,057Total stock-based compensation expense$           3,237$          4,885  To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/etsy-inc-reports-first-quarter-2017-financial-results-300449978.htmlSOURCE  Etsy, Inc.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Operational Highlights 
GMS was $865.2 million, up 16.7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. On a currency-neutral basis (excluding the direct impact of currency translation on GMS from goods that are not listed in U.S. dollars) GMS growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 would have been 18.2%. GMS growth was driven by 11.8% year-over-year growth in active sellers and 18.8% year-over-year growth in active buyers.  
Continuing the trend we've seen for multiple quarters, mobile visits once again grew faster than desktop visits. Percent mobile visits was approximately 65% compared with approximately 61% in the fourth quarter of 2015 and flat compared with the third quarter of 2016. Percent mobile GMS was approximately 49% compared with approximately 44% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and flat compared with the third quarter of 2016. Year-over-year conversion rates increased across desktop, mobile web and mobile app for the fifth consecutive quarter. During the fourth quarter, the year-over-year growth in mobile GMS together with the strength in overall mobile conversion rates resulted in a slight narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile GMS. Mobile app and mobile web GMS each continued to grow significantly faster than desktop GMS during the fourth quarter.
Percent international GMS was 30.4% in the fourth quarter of 2016, up from 29.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and flat compared with the third quarter of 2016. 
During the fourth quarter of 2016, percent international GMS was largely driven by continued robust GMS growth between U.S. buyers and international sellers and GMS growth between buyers and sellers outside of the U.S., both in the same country and cross-border. GMS growth between international buyers and sellers in the same country remained the fastest growing category of international GMS. GMS between international buyers and sellers in the same country grew 44% year-over-year during the fourth quarter, and has grown from our smallest GMS category to be more similar in size to GMS between international buyers and sellers in different countries; both of these GMS categories are now larger than GMS between U.S. sellers and international buyers. We believe the robust growth in GMS between international buyers and sellers in the same country demonstrates the progress we are making on our strategy to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world. GMS between U.S. sellers and international buyers declined 8% in the fourth quarter. While we continue to believe that the decline in this GMS category is indicative of the indirect impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on international buyer behavior, given this GMS category's size relative to other GMS categories, the indirect impact of fluctuating currency has become less of a headwind to our GMS growth. 
Recent Operational Highlights:
Throughout 2016, we launched products and services to complement our markets and services platform, to help our sellers around the world turn their creative passion into a business and to improve the global buyer experience. In April 2016 we launched Pattern by Etsy, our fourth paid Seller Service, expanded Direct Checkout into 14 new countries, added expedited United States Postal Service Shipping Labels, partnered with Google to launch our Google Shopping tool, added to our search and machine learning capabilities with the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies and launched our first-ever global brand campaign called "Difference Makes Us" to highlight Etsy as a go-to shopping destination for buyers around the world. Given the early success of our brand campaign, we intend to expand our investment in the Etsy brand throughout 2017. 
Looking ahead, 2017 is off to a strong start with several key product developments: These include:

We announced our plan to launch a market dedicated to craft supplies. Etsy Studio will enable craft supplies sellers to tap into a larger audience of crafters, makers and DIY enthusiasts around the world. The market, which we expect to launch in April 2017, will offer millions of listings along with content such as tutorials and craft ideas, so buyers will be able to find both materials and inspiration for their next projects. 
We launched Shop Manager so that sellers can track orders, manage inventory, view metrics and statistics and have conversations with buyers, for all of their Etsy channels in one place. It's a centralized operating hub for sellers to manage all aspects of their Etsy businesses. 
We are improving and streamlining the checkout process with our recent launch of multi-shop checkout and the upcoming launch of guest checkout. Multi-shop checkout enables buyers to complete purchases from multiple sellers with Direct Checkout in one simple transaction and guest checkout will allow buyers to make purchases from sellers without creating or signing into an Etsy account.

Fourth Quarter 2016 Financial Highlights
Total revenue was $110.2 million, up 25.4% year-over-year, driven by growth in both Markets and Seller Services revenue. Markets revenue grew 17.9%, primarily due to growth in transaction fee revenue and, to a lesser extent, growth in listing fee revenue. Seller Services revenue grew 30.7% year-over-year, driven primarily by revenue growth in Direct Checkout. Seller Services revenue also benefited from revenue growth from Promoted Listings and to a lesser extent, Shipping Labels, as well as a modest contribution from Pattern by Etsy. During the fourth quarter, we reached the 1-year anniversary of the integration of Paypal into Direct Checkout, which had been a substantial driver of year-over-year Direct Checkout and overall Seller Services revenue growth during 2016.  This anniversary will have an impact on our Seller Services revenue growth in 2017.
Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $73.2 million, up 26.9% year-over-year, and gross margin was 66.4%, up 80 bps compared with 65.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Gross profit grew faster than revenue in the fourth quarter due to the leverage we achieved in technology infrastructure.
Total operating expenses were $69.8 million in the fourth quarter, up 41.5% year-over-year, and represented 63.3% of revenue, up from 56.1% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in operating expenses as a percent of revenue is primarily due to an increase in employee-related expenses related to our acquisition of Blackbird Technologies and marketing expenses related to our brand campaign. 
During the fourth quarter, marketing expenses were $31.0 million, up 38.0% year-over-year and represented 28.1% of revenue compared with 25.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by brand marketing spend, mostly on YouTube and Facebook and, to a lesser extent, digital marketing (which excludes brand marketing-related spend on YouTube and Facebook) and employee-related expenses. Digital marketing spend increased 8.4% year-over-year during the fourth quarter.
Product development expenses were $16.1 million, up 43.8% year-over-year, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses including the acquisition of Blackbird Technologies. Product development expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to 14.6% compared with 12.8% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
G&A expenses were $22.7 million, up 45.0% year-over-year, driven by increased employee-related expenses, a favorable 2015 mark-to-market adjustment of stock-based compensation related to ALM, depreciation expense related to our new Brooklyn headquarters and professional services spend mainly related to compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley. G&A expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to 20.5% compared with 17.7% in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Based on build-to-suit accounting requirements, we recognized $0.8 million and $2.1 million in incremental depreciation and non-cash interest expense, respectively, in the fourth quarter related to our new Brooklyn headquarters, as expected. For more information on the cash impact of our build-to-suit lease agreement, please refer to "Note 14—Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2016 Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $21.4 million, compared with a $4.2 million net loss in the fourth quarter of 2015. Etsy's net loss in the fourth quarter of 2016 included a foreign exchange loss of $18.0 million, a tax provision of $4.8 million and $2.1 million in interest expense associated with the build-to-suit lease accounting related to our new headquarters, all primarily non-cash. 
Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $15.3 million and grew 8.7% year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin (i.e., non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue) was 13.9%, down 210 bps year-over-year. Non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA performance was driven primarily by higher employee-related costs.
Net cash provided by operating activities was $18.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared with $10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was mainly driven by revenue growth.
Cash, marketable securities and short-term investments were $282.1 million as of December 31, 2016.
Issuing 2017 Financial Guidance and Raising 2016-2018 Outlook for Revenue and GMS
We believe our recent and planned investments will enable Etsy to continue to deliver long-term, sustainable growth to our stakeholders. We are providing 2017 guidance and increasing our outlook for GMS and revenue within our 2016-2018 guidance:






 2016-2018 CAGR Range 

 2017 Guidance 


 GMS Growth 

 16-17% 

 15-17% 


 Revenue Growth 

 23-25% 

 20-22% 


 Gross Margin (by end of 2018) 

 Mid 60s (%) 

 Mid 60s (%) 


 Adjusted EBITDA Margin (by end of 2018) 

 High teens (%) 

 12-14% 




 

Based on our progress in 2016 and our expectations for 2017 and 2018, we now expect to achieve a 2016-2018 GMS CAGR in the 16-17% range and a 2016-2018 revenue CAGR in the 23-25% range. In 2017, we expect GMS growth to range between 15-17% and revenue growth to range between 20-22%. 
We anticipate that the key factors impacting revenue and GMS growth through 2018 will include: 
     
Conversion rate gains across mobile and desktop that reflect improvements in our search and recommendation capabilities. 
A digital marketing ROI that continues to outperform our two-year LTV model. 
Further narrowing of the gap between mobile visits and mobile GMS, driven by mobile GMS performance. 
International GMS growth that exceeds growth in domestic U.S. GMS driven by our efforts to build local communities and foster local connections and currency exchange rates that are stable compared to average levels in December 2016. 
Continued Seller Services revenue growth, although at a slower pace than what we achieved in 2016, driven by both adoption and product enhancements. 
Modest contributions from recent Seller Services and tools, including Google Shopping and Pattern by Etsy.

We are reiterating our expectation that we will exit 2018 with a full-year gross margin that is in the Mid-60s percent range, and we expect 2017 gross margin to also be in the Mid-60s percent range. We continue to anticipate that the key factors impacting our gross margin forecast over our 2016-2018 guidance period include: 
     
Revenue growth from our existing Seller Services, driven by both adoption and product enhancements. 
The impact of new Seller Services such as Pattern by Etsy. 

We also reiterate our expectation that we will exit 2018 with a high teens Adjusted EBITDA margin. For 2017, we anticipate that the key factors impacting Adjusted EBITDA include: 
     
We expect overall marketing expenses as a percent of revenue to increase for 2017, primarily driven by investment in our first-ever brand marketing campaign that we launched in late 2016. We expect to increase our investment in brand marketing in 2017. 
Our acquisition of Blackbird Technologies is expected to drive an increase in product development expenses as a percent of revenue in 2017. We will recognize additional product development expenses of approximately $3 million in the first quarter of 2017 and approximately $2 million per quarter over the next three years. This amount will consist of contingent consideration, in the form of both stock and cash compensation expense, of approximately $1.4 million and amortization expense related to the acquired intangible asset of approximately $0.6 million. 
We expect G&A expense as a percent of revenue to decline in 2017. 
Based on these factors, we expect 2017 Adjusted EBITDA margin to range between 12% and 14%. 
Excluding our brand marketing investment, 2017 Adjusted EBITDA margin would be approximately flat compared with 2016.


Etsy is not able, at this time, to provide GAAP targets for net income margin for the full year 2017 and 2016-2018 because of the unreasonable effort of estimating certain non-cash items that are excluded from non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA margin, including provision for income taxes, acquisition-related stock-based compensation expense and foreign exchange gain or loss, the effect of which may be significant.
Update on Chief Financial Officer Transition
As previously announced, Etsy's current CFO, Kristina Salen, will leave the company at the end of March 2017 to pursue other professional opportunities. Etsy is actively engaged in a search for her successor. We have a deep bench of talent throughout our finance team and our Board of Directors, and our management team continues to work closely with Kristina to ensure a smooth and seamless transition.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In this press release, we provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net loss adjusted to exclude: interest and other non-operating expense, net; provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; stock-based compensation expense; loss on asset impairment; net unrealized (gain) loss on warrant and other liabilities; foreign exchange loss; acquisition-related expenses and contributions to Good Work Institute (formerly Etsy.org). Following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. 
We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans, determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges.
Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense or changes in the fair value of warrants; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange loss; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of loss on asset impairment; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related expenses; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect other non-operating expenses, net of other non-operating income, including net interest expense; 
Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact of our contributions to Good Work Institute (formerly Etsy.org); and 
other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results.
