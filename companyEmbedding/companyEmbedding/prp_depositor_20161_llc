How Regenexx Procedures Work
 
 
 




Stem Cell TreatmentsSame Day Stem Cell Protocol
 
				

Adult stem cells are cells from your own body that can renew themselves and turn into other cells (differentiate). They live inside all of us in various tissues, poised to leap into action to repair damage as it occurs. As we age or have big injuries, we may not be able to recruit enough of these cells to the site to fully repair the area. Regenexx Stem Cell Procedures help overcome this problem by extracting stem cells from an area of high volume, then concentrating the cells and reinjecting them into the damaged area to help the body heal naturally. Our Patented Stem Cell Procedures can be used for a wide range of conditions and are the tool of choice for injuries, arthritis and other conditions that may be more significant than what may be treated with our Platelet Rich Plasma or Platelet Lysate Procedures.


			 
Stem Cell Procedure Details

 



Blood Platelet TreatmentsSuper Concentrated Platelet Rich Plasma & Advanced Platelet Lysate Procedures
 
				

Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and Platelet Lysate Injection Treatments contain healing growth components from your own blood that increase your body’s natural ability to repair itself. The use of PRP to repair joint, tendon, ligament, and muscle injuries is becoming well known, thanks to exposure from professional athletes. Platelet injection treatments are effective because they have a stimulating effect on the stem cells within the targeted area, making those stem cells work harder to heal damaged tissues. Our Advanced Platelet Procedures are more pure and concentrated than those created by the automated machines used at most regenerative medicine clinics. Platelet procedures are commonly used for soft tissue injuries, mild arthritis and spine conditions.


			 
Platelet Procedure Details

 
 
 






A Complete Stem Cell Protocol – Not Just a Single Procedure


The Regenexx Patented Stem Cell Protocol has been researched and continually improved for more than a decade. The protocol used in the United States typically involves a series of injections that take place over the course of approximately one week. The Stem Cell extraction and reinjection happens during the same day, while the other two injection steps happen before and after the same day stem cell procedure and are designed to enhance the results of the stem cell procedure.


 

 
 




The Best Possible Patient Outcomes


At Regenexx® no corners are cut. Our regenerative procedures are 100% focused on producing the best possible patient outcomes, without trying to balance quality with profitability.


 

 
 




100% Focused on Orthopedics


We don’t treat everything and we’re proud of that fact. We are orthopedic specialists. Each doctor in the Regenexx Network is a musculoskeletal expert trained in our procedures and have proven skills in advanced injections for the body areas that they are certified to treat.


 

 
 




Up to 20 Times More Stem Cells Available for Your Treatment Using Patented Cell Processing Procedure

Regenexx® continually improves our processes to maximize the available stem cells for your treatment. Our patented multi-tier lab technique typically yields 10 to 20 times more stem cells than is possible using the simple automated equipment utilized by most stem cell clinics.

 

 
 




Image-Guided Injections and Harvesting


Even experienced orthopedic specialists cannot hit an exact spot without taking a look inside. The imaging technology that we use during your procedure allows us to not only see the anatomy of the area being injected, but we have live visualization of the needle and the distribution of the injected cells. Precise needle placement for stem cell harvesting and reinjection is a key element in producing the best possible outcomes.


 

 
 




Backed by the Most Research

Regenexx® is the original orthopedic stem cell treatment in the United States and we’re responsible for a very large portion of the published orthopedic stem cell literature available today. View Published Research at Regenexx.com.

 

 
 




Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells


Research has shown that stem cells derived from bone marrow (rather than fat) are most effective for treating orthopedic injuries and conditions. We utilize advanced imaging guidance during the stem cell harvesting procedure to ensure the cells are being obtained from the exact area in the hip that is known to be rich in mesenchymal stem cells.


 

 
 




Published Patient Outcome Data & Transparency


At Regenexx® we publish our patient outcome data on a regular basis and make it available to the public on our website and in peer-reviewed research papers. Regenexx patients are tracked in a registry for functional improvements, pain scales, outcomes and safety data.

RegenLab USA LLC – Platelet Rich Plasma PRP














































 










































					What is A-PRP® / PRP™? 
					












A-PRP®/ PRP™ is the patient's platelet concentrate prepared with RegenKit®

The physician draws a small amount of venous blood and isolates the red cells from a platelet concentrate, embedded in its own plasma. The entire process takes less then 10 minutes.

As A-PRP® is processed from the patients own blood, there is no risk of allergy or rejection with this treatment.



A-PRP® / PRP™ Components
Platelets are key factors in hard and soft tissue repair mechanisms. They provide the essential growth factors FGF, PDGF, TGF-ß, EGF, VEGF, IGF that are involved in stem cell migration, differentiation and proliferation. The stimulation of fibroblasts and endothelial cells induces new extracellular matrix deposition and neo-vascularization.
Plasma is essential for cell survival as it contains nutrients, vitamins, hormones, electrolytes and proteins. Proteins are key molecules for the coagulation process and the formation of the fibrin polymer that will serve as a scaffold for cell migration, differentiation and proliferation.


Optimal Platelet Concentration

The Regen™ BCT (Blood Cell Therapy)  tube prepares 4 to 5ml of autologous platelet rich plasma with a platelet recovery superior to 80% and a concentration factor of 1.6-fold. Although the system is technically capable of producing significantly higher platelet concentrations, it is not what research shows to be beneficial for clinical use. More and more studies demonstrate that concentrations of platelets 1 to 3 times over the baseline show more robust healing rates than those with concentrations of 3 to 8 times the baseline1.
Some studies even showed that too high platelet concentrations may actually have negative effects. In a in vivo study2 it was shown that highly concentrated platelet preparations had an inhibitory influence on osteoblast activity, probably due to unwanted inhibitory and cytotoxic effects of growth factors at such high concentrations. Similarly an in vitro study3, demonstrated that platelet concentration over 2.5-fold, resulted in a reduction in proliferation and a suboptimal effect on osteoblast function.


White Blood Cells in Tissue Regeneration
White blood cells are strongly reduced (> 85% depletion) in Regen BCT A-PRP®.

The role of white blood cells (WBC) in healing is controversially discussed among physicians. To address this concern scientifically, WBC subsets, granulocytes and mononuclear cells, need to be looked at individually. Granulocytes, and more specifically neutrophils, are the front-line defenders against invading pathogens and are associated with the inflammatory response. They release a large variety of highly active antimicrobial substances and proteases. Uncontrolled release of these factors can cause severe damage to the tissue, delay healing rates and increase the risk of scarring4. Thanks to the RegenKit BCT technology more than 96% of the granulocytes are removed from A-PRP®.
The few white blood cells still present in A-PRP® are mostly mononuclear cells (lymphocytes and monocytes). These two cell types are also involved in the immune response but have been shown to support the healing process5,6.

RegenKit® BCT - A-PRP® - PRP® - RegenPRP™ - Regen Extracell® Product Highlights
Simplicity:
Only a few steps are required to prepare 4 to 5 ml of A-PRP®.
 
Low Blood Volume Required: RegenKit® BCT is designed to prepare autologous platelet concentrate from only 8 ml of blood.
Optimum Platelet Recovery: 
 RegenKit® BCT you recover around 80% of the platelets from the whole blood. Platelets are concentrated in autologous plasma.
Consistent Isolation of PRP:
 RegenKit® BCT uses a physical barrier (thixotropic gel) to separate the red blood cells from the plasma and the cellular sediment. The preparation is safe and consistent.

Red Blood Cell Depletion: 
 The level of Red Blood Cells is drastically reduced, with more than 99,7% of complete Red Blood Cell removal. 
BCT stands for Blood Cell Therapy

The RegenLab BCT family kits are designed to prepare Autologous - Platelet Rich Plasma from a small sample oft he patients own blood. Each BCT tube draws 8cc of venous blood and yields 4-5cc of autologous platelet concentrate. RegenLab USA offers procedure kits consisting 1, 2 or 4 BCT processing tubes. Which kit to use is to be determined by the physicians required volume of PRP. The RegenKit BCT 1, 2 and 4 consist  of all blood draw and transfer accessories. The RegenKit BCT 3 contains 3 processing tubes only, individually sterile packed. Please refer to the videos below for instructions of use. 


WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

1. Use proper safety precautions to guard against needles.
2. Use a horizontal head (swinging bucket) centrifuge or a fixed angle head centrifuge. Follow manufacturer instructions when using centrifuge.
3. Excessive centrifugation force (over 2200 RCF) may cause tube breakage, exposure to blood, and possible injury. Regen™ BCT tubes should be centrifuged, as recommended in the instructions for use, at 1500 RCF.
4. Centrifuge carriers and inserts should be of the size specific for the Regen™ BCT tubes. Use of carriers too large or too small for the tube may result in breakage. Care should be taken to ensure that Regen™ BCT tubes are properly seated in the centrifuge cup. Tubes must be balanced in the centrifuge head to minimize the possibility of glass breakage.
5. Do not use sterile component of this kit if the package is opened or damaged.
6. Single use device, do not reuse any part of the kit.
7. The practitioner is to be thoroughly familiar with the equipment and the procedure prior to using the kit
8. The patient is to be made aware of general risks associated with treatment and possible adverse effects.

9. PRP concentrate is to be prepared from fresh blood and used extemporaneously.

10. The platelet rich plasma must be used within four (4) hours of blood collection.

11. Store between 5°C - 30°C – Bring kit at ambient temperature before using Regen™ BCT tubes. 12. Do not use components of this kit if they are broken or present a defect.

POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS

1. Damage to blood vessels, hematoma, delayed wound healing and/or infection. 2. Temporary or permanent nerve damage that may result in pain or numbness. 3. Early or late operative infection.

Platelet Rich Plasma is used in a broad range of healing applications
What is GLO PRP?
Human blood contains among other things red blood cells, white blood cells and serum, or plasma, but also some amount of platelets (thrombocytes). Platelets are tiny cell fragments that circulate through our bloodstream. Platelets main responsibility is to stop the bleeding in case of injury.  Crucial function is also to repair wide range of injuries and diseases in both soft and hard tissues. This is possible due to many growth factors incorporated in platelets as part of the natural blood flow. If blood platelet count falls below normal, the condition is called thrombocytopenia. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is blood plasma that is enriched with platelets.  As a concentrated autologous (naturally derived from the same individual) platelets, PRP contains several different growth factors and other cytokines that stimulate healing of bone and soft tissues.
Preparation of the GLO PRP is simple and straight forward.  1 ml of Anticoagulant Citrate Dextrose Solution (ACD-A) or Sodium Citrate is added into a sterile GLO PRP syringe and 9 ml of whole blood is drawn from the patient. The GLO PRP syringe is then placed into a tube holder of the Glofinn's centrifuge and a counterweight is placed on a tube holder on the opposite side. The parameters of centrifugation is found in the Glofinn's centrifuge manual. A patented GLO PRP Kit separates plasma and red blood cells (RBC) by separating the RBC into the attached RBC collector.  After removing the RBC collector, PRP concentrates are found at the bottom of the tube.  PRP concentrates are ready to draw directly into an injection syringe for a procedure / applications.  The concentration of PRP is adjustable by varying the amount of utilizable dose.
Use of PRP procedure has 40+ years of history, showing its benefits in various healthcare and medical industry.  PRP has been successfully applied in many fields, such as orthopedics, sports medicine, wound healing, aesthetic surgery, dentistry, otolaryngology, neurosurgery, ophthalmology, urology, veterinary, prolotherapy, cardiothoracic and maxillofacial surgery.

Warnings, Precautions and Adverse Effects 








What is PRP?
Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is an isolated component containing concentrated platelets & natural growth factors responsible for the promotion of healing damaged hard & soft tissues.


How is PRP being prepared?
PRP is derived from a small amount of the patient’s own blood. The blood is processed in a dedicated tube and spun for 5 minutes according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The preparation is easy, safe and takes less than 10 minutes altogether.


Platelet Concentration
In order for the growth factor benefits to be harnessed they must be isolated intact. A distinguishing feature of the A-CP-Kit® system is the use of a thixotropic gel separator. This gel allows for the ideal concentration factor of 1.6 fold the patient’s baseline to be prepared, resulting in an optimal platelet recovery upwards of 80%. Although the system is capable of yielding a higher platelet concentration, the concentration of 1.6 fold has been clinically proven to be effective in various published studies for different indications.







Application
The use of A-CP-Kit® Platelet Rich Plasma has been evaluated in clinical studies across various medical disciplines.
The A-CP-Kit® product family is indicated by the US FDA for the safe and rapid preparation of Autologous-Platelet Rich Plasma (A-PRP) from a small sample of blood at the patient’s point of care. The A-PRP is mixed with autograft and / or allograft bone prior to application to a bony defect for improving handling characteristics. The A-CP-Kit® family kits are for single use only.

(the "Company") today announced that TRU 2016-1 Depositor, LLC (the "Depositor"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, has priced $512,000,000 aggregate principal amount of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-TOYS (the "Certificates"), representing beneficial interests in a trust fund consisting of floating-rate first mortgage loan obligations of Toys"R"Us Property Company II, LLC ("Propco II").  The sale of the Certificates is expected to close on November 3, 2016, subject to customary closing conditions.








The Certificates will represent interests in and obligations of the issuing trust and will not represent the obligations of the Company, the Depositor, Propco II or any of their affiliates.  The Certificates will consist of six classes of floating rate certificates, each with an assumed final distribution date occurring in November 2019 and an assumed extended final distribution date occurring in November 2021. The approximate initial weighted average interest rate of all six classes of certificates is one month LIBOR + 487bps.
Propco II intends to use the net proceeds of the mortgage loan funded through the CMBS financing, together with the net proceeds of $88 million of mezzanine financing and other available cash, to fund the previously announced redemption of its 8.50% Senior Secured Notes due 2017 (the "Notes").  The Notes are expected to be redeemed upon the closing of the sale of the Certificates on November 3, 2016.
The offer and sale of the Certificates have not and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or any applicable state or foreign securities laws, and are being offered (A) in the United States only to (1) qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and (2) other institutions that are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and any entity in which all of the equity owners are "accredited investors" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, or (B) to certain non-U.S. persons in offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act.  This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase the Certificates or any other securities, and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.

Forward-Looking Statements 
All statements that are not historical facts in this press release, including statements about our beliefs or expectations, are forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, including, among others, the seasonality of our business, competition in the retail industry, changes in our product distribution mix and distribution channels, general economic factors in the United States and other countries in which we conduct our business, consumer spending patterns, birth rates, our ability to implement our strategy including implementing initiatives for season, our ability to recognize cost savings, implementation and operation of our new e-commerce platform, marketing strategies, the availability of adequate financing, access to trade credit, changes in consumer preferences, changes in employment legislation, our dependence on key vendors for our merchandise, political and other developments associated with our international operations, costs of goods that we sell, labor costs, transportation costs, domestic and international events affecting the delivery of toys and other products to our stores, product safety issues including product recalls, the existence of adverse litigation, changes in laws that impact our business, our substantial level of indebtedness and related debt-service obligations, restrictions imposed by covenants in our debt agreements and other risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in our reports and documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (which reports and documents should be read in conjunction with this press release). In addition, we typically earn a disproportionate part of our annual operating earnings in the fourth quarter as a result of seasonal buying patterns and these buying patterns are difficult to forecast with certainty. We believe that all forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions when made; however, we caution that it is impossible to predict actual results or outcomes or the effects of risks, uncertainties or other factors on anticipated results or outcomes and that, accordingly, one should not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they were made, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements in light of subsequent events or developments unless required by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and regulations. Actual results and outcomes may differ materially from anticipated results or outcomes discussed in any forward-looking statement.

How Regenexx Procedures Work
 
 
 




Stem Cell TreatmentsSame Day Stem Cell Protocol
 
				

Adult stem cells are cells from your own body that can renew themselves and turn into other cells (differentiate). They live inside all of us in various tissues, poised to leap into action to repair damage as it occurs. As we age or have big injuries, we may not be able to recruit enough of these cells to the site to fully repair the area. Regenexx Stem Cell Procedures help overcome this problem by extracting stem cells from an area of high volume, then concentrating the cells and reinjecting them into the damaged area to help the body heal naturally. Our Patented Stem Cell Procedures can be used for a wide range of conditions and are the tool of choice for injuries, arthritis and other conditions that may be more significant than what may be treated with our Platelet Rich Plasma or Platelet Lysate Procedures.


			 
Stem Cell Procedure Details

 



Blood Platelet TreatmentsSuper Concentrated Platelet Rich Plasma & Advanced Platelet Lysate Procedures
 
				

Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) and Platelet Lysate Injection Treatments contain healing growth components from your own blood that increase your body’s natural ability to repair itself. The use of PRP to repair joint, tendon, ligament, and muscle injuries is becoming well known, thanks to exposure from professional athletes. Platelet injection treatments are effective because they have a stimulating effect on the stem cells within the targeted area, making those stem cells work harder to heal damaged tissues. Our Advanced Platelet Procedures are more pure and concentrated than those created by the automated machines used at most regenerative medicine clinics. Platelet procedures are commonly used for soft tissue injuries, mild arthritis and spine conditions.


			 
Platelet Procedure Details

 
 
 






A Complete Stem Cell Protocol – Not Just a Single Procedure


The Regenexx Patented Stem Cell Protocol has been researched and continually improved for more than a decade. The protocol used in the United States typically involves a series of injections that take place over the course of approximately one week. The Stem Cell extraction and reinjection happens during the same day, while the other two injection steps happen before and after the same day stem cell procedure and are designed to enhance the results of the stem cell procedure.


 

 
 




The Best Possible Patient Outcomes


At Regenexx® no corners are cut. Our regenerative procedures are 100% focused on producing the best possible patient outcomes, without trying to balance quality with profitability.


 

 
 




100% Focused on Orthopedics


We don’t treat everything and we’re proud of that fact. We are orthopedic specialists. Each doctor in the Regenexx Network is a musculoskeletal expert trained in our procedures and have proven skills in advanced injections for the body areas that they are certified to treat.


 

 
 




Up to 20 Times More Stem Cells Available for Your Treatment Using Patented Cell Processing Procedure

Regenexx® continually improves our processes to maximize the available stem cells for your treatment. Our patented multi-tier lab technique typically yields 10 to 20 times more stem cells than is possible using the simple automated equipment utilized by most stem cell clinics.

 

 
 




Image-Guided Injections and Harvesting


Even experienced orthopedic specialists cannot hit an exact spot without taking a look inside. The imaging technology that we use during your procedure allows us to not only see the anatomy of the area being injected, but we have live visualization of the needle and the distribution of the injected cells. Precise needle placement for stem cell harvesting and reinjection is a key element in producing the best possible outcomes.


 

 
 




Backed by the Most Research

Regenexx® is the original orthopedic stem cell treatment in the United States and we’re responsible for a very large portion of the published orthopedic stem cell literature available today. View Published Research at Regenexx.com.

 

 
 




Bone Marrow Derived Stem Cells


Research has shown that stem cells derived from bone marrow (rather than fat) are most effective for treating orthopedic injuries and conditions. We utilize advanced imaging guidance during the stem cell harvesting procedure to ensure the cells are being obtained from the exact area in the hip that is known to be rich in mesenchymal stem cells.


 

 
 




Published Patient Outcome Data & Transparency


At Regenexx® we publish our patient outcome data on a regular basis and make it available to the public on our website and in peer-reviewed research papers. Regenexx patients are tracked in a registry for functional improvements, pain scales, outcomes and safety data.
