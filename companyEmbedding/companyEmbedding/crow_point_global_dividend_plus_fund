Recon Capital & Crow Point Partners Launch the Crow Point Dividend 
      Plus Fund (SYMBOL: GDPIX)




Fund Seeks to Provide a High Level of Current Income as well as 
      Capital Preservation






August 04, 2016 08:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



GREENWICH, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Recon Capital, an investment firm and exchange traded fund (ETF) 
      provider has expanded its product offerings by partnering with Crow 
      Point Partners, LLC, a boutique investment manager with a long track 
      record in global equity, alternative, and specialty fixed income 
      strategies, to offer the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (Symbol: GDPIX).
    


      “Today, with yield and volatility curves at historic lows, investors 
      face an inordinate amount of assymetric risk. Investment management 
      firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does 
      that,” said Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The 
      Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: 
      (1) a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the 
      majority of the fund’s invested assets; (2) a short duration, 
      high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve;and (3) a dynamic options overlay 
      for additional income.
    

      According to Garrett Paollela, CEO of Recon Capital and the fund’s 
      adviser, “Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short 
      strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product.” 
      The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimizes 
      income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that 
      maximizes income” Paollela added, “The closed-end fund structure gives a 
      manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a 
      long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between 
      higher yields and risk mitigation.”
    

      “We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in 
      options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield 
      buyer,” Paollela said. “Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally 
      suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that 
      income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to 
      present a product that does that.“ Paollela added, “Recon Capital is 
      committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver 
      market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving 
      needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion.”

Risk considerations


Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, 
      risks, charges and expenses of the Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund. 
      This and other important information about the Fund is contained in the 
      prospectus, which can be obtained by calling 1-844-348-7587 
      (844-DIV-PLUS) or at www.reconfunds.com/GDPIX. 
      The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. The Crow Point 
      Global Dividend Plus Fund is distributed by Northern Lights 
      Distributors, LLC member FINRA. Recon Capital Partners, LLC and Northern 
      Lights Distributors, LLC are not affiliated.


The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund is a continuously offered, 
      non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.


This investment may not be suitable for all investors and an 
      investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the 
      risks associated with the illiquidity of the Fund's shares and should be 
      viewed as a long-term investment.


      Long/ Short: Involves buying long equities that are expected to increase 
      in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in 
      value.
    

An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. The 
      Fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of income over the 
      long term. The Fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish 
      to exploit short-term swings in the stock market. The Fund cannot assure 
      you that the investment objectives will be achieved. Fund is not 
      intended to be a complete investment program. There are several risks 
      associated with transactions in options on securities used in connection 
      with the Fund’s options strategy. The Fund is a newly organized, 
      non-diversified, closed-end investment Management Company and it has no 
      operating history. The Fund will have substantial short positions. The 
      Fund is actively managed, and its performance will reflect the Adviser’s 
      ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the 
      Fund’s investment objectives.


The Fund may invest in securities that are traded in foreign markets 
      and that are not subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities 
      laws, markets and accounting requirements (“Foreign Securities”). 
      Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, 
      less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets. The 
      Fund intends to attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline 
      in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of 
      securities. The Fund will have substantial short positions.


Rising interest rates may adversely affect the price of the 
      securities held by the Fund. The Fund’s strategy of investing in 
      dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out 
      of favor with investors and underperform the market.


The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that have comparatively 
      smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are 
      included in major equity benchmark indices, which presents unique 
      investment risks. The Fund will not use external leverage to seek 
      to achieve its investment objectives, external leverage being defined as 
      borrowing funds from banks or other financial institutions, reverse 
      repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or the issuance of preferred 
      shares, or leverage in the form of a revolving credit facility. The Fund 
      may gain exposure to the real estate sector by investing in REITs, real 
      estate-linked derivatives, and common, preferred and convertible 
      securities of issuers in real estate-related industries. Each of these 
      types of investments are subject to risks similar to those associated 
      with direct ownership of real estate. Although the equity 
      securities in which the Fund invests generally trade on major stock 
      exchanges, certain securities may trade less frequently, potentially 
      those of issuers with smaller capitalizations. Securities with limited 
      trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements.


The use of Derivative Transactions may be speculative and involves 
      risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated 
      with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the 
      Fund seeks to close out an exchange-listed option position. The 
      Fund may sell index put and call options from time to time. Income 
      on options on individual stocks will generally not be recognized by the 
      Fund for tax purposes until an option is exercised, lapses or is subject 
      to a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that any 
      hedging activities of the Fund, including through derivative 
      transactions, will be successful. Fund may invest in the securities of 
      other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, and in 
      exchange- traded notes.


      The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund (the "Fund") is registered with 
      the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-diversified, 
      management investment company, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 
      1940. An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the loss 
      of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee the Fund will 
      achieve its investment objective. The Fund's shares may be more volatile 
      than the performance of a broadly diversified portfolio. The Fund is not 
      by itself a complete or balanced investment program.
    

      Market forces may result in shares trading at a significant premium or 
      discount to NAV. Although the shares are currently listed on an 
      exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for 
      the shares will develop or be maintained.
    

      The Fund's performance is expected to be closely tied to social, 
      political, and economic conditions within Europe and to be more volatile 
      than the performance of more geographically diversified funds. An 
      investment in European securities can be adversely affected by a variety 
      of factors, among which are: restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, 
      interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls imposed by 
      the European Union or European Monetary Union; historically high 
      unemployment and significant debt problems in certain European nations; 
      recently volatility in European financial markets due to concerns about 
      economic downturns or rising government debt levels. Currently, a 
      significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies 
      in France, Germany and Spain.
    

      Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and 
      may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including 
      countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates 
      and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of 
      the Fund's investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the 
      Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if 
      the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests 
      depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund's 
      holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.

Recon Capital & Crow Point Partners Launch the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (SYMBOL: GDPIX)


 Recon Capital, an investment firm and exchange traded fund (ETF) 
 provider has expanded its product offerings by partnering with Crow 
 Point Partners, LLC, a boutique investment manager with a long track 
 record in global equity, alternative, and specialty fixed income 
 strategies, to offer the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund (Symbol: GDPIX).
 

 "Today, with yield and volatility curves at historic lows, investors 
 face an inordinate amount of assymetric risk. Investment management 
 firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does 
 that," said Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The 
 Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: 
 (1) a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the 
 majority of the fund's invested assets; (2) a short duration, 
 high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve;and (3) a dynamic options overlay 
 for additional income.
 

 According to Garrett Paollela, CEO of Recon Capital and the fund's 
 adviser, "Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short 
 strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product." 
 The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimizes 
 income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that 
 maximizes income" Paollela added, "The closed-end fund structure gives a 
 manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a 
 long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between 
 higher yields and risk mitigation."
 

 "We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in 
 options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today's yield 
 buyer," Paollela said. "Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally 
 suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that 
 income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to 
 present a product that does that." Paollela added, "Recon Capital is 
 committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver 
 market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving 
 needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion."

 investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the 
 risks associated with the illiquidity of the Fund's shares and should be 
 viewed as a long-term investment.


 Long/ Short: Involves buying long equities that are expected to increase 
 in value and selling short equities that are expected to decrease in 
 value.
 

An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors. The 
 Fund is intended for investors seeking a high level of income over the 
 long term. The Fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish 
 to exploit short-term swings in the stock market. The Fund cannot assure 
 you that the investment objectives will be achieved. Fund is not 
 intended to be a complete investment program. There are several risks 
 associated with transactions in options on securities used in connection 
 with the Fund's options strategy. The Fund is a newly organized, 
 non-diversified, closed-end investment Management Company and it has no 
 operating history. The Fund will have substantial short positions. The 
 Fund is actively managed, and its performance will reflect the Adviser's 
 ability to make investment decisions that are suited to achieving the 
 Fund's investment objectives.


The Fund may invest in securities that are traded in foreign markets 
 and that are not subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities 
 laws, markets and accounting requirements ("Foreign Securities"). 
 Emerging securities markets are substantially smaller, less developed, 
 less liquid and more volatile than the major securities markets. The 
 Fund intends to attempt to limit exposure to a possible market decline 
 in the value of its portfolio securities through short sales of 
 securities. The Fund will have substantial short positions.


Rising interest rates may adversely affect the price of the 
 securities held by the Fund. The Fund's strategy of investing in 
 dividend-paying stocks involves the risk that such stocks may fall out 
 of favor with investors and underperform the market.


The Fund may invest in securities of issuers that have comparatively 
 smaller capitalizations relative to issuers whose securities are 
 included in major equity benchmark indices, which presents unique 
 investment risks. The Fund will not use external leverage to seek 
 to achieve its investment objectives, external leverage being defined as 
 borrowing funds from banks or other financial institutions, reverse 
 repurchase agreements, dollar rolls and/or the issuance of preferred 
 shares, or leverage in the form of a revolving credit facility. The Fund 
 may gain exposure to the real estate sector by investing in REITs, real 
 estate-linked derivatives, and common, preferred and convertible 
 securities of issuers in real estate-related industries. Each of these 
 types of investments are subject to risks similar to those associated 
 with direct ownership of real estate. Although the equity 
 securities in which the Fund invests generally trade on major stock 
 exchanges, certain securities may trade less frequently, potentially 
 those of issuers with smaller capitalizations. Securities with limited 
 trading volumes may display volatile or erratic price movements.


The use of Derivative Transactions may be speculative and involves 
 risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated 
 with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments.
There can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist when the 
 Fund seeks to close out an exchange-listed option position. The 
 Fund may sell index put and call options from time to time. Income 
 on options on individual stocks will generally not be recognized by the 
 Fund for tax purposes until an option is exercised, lapses or is subject 
 to a closing transaction. There can be no assurance that any 
 hedging activities of the Fund, including through derivative 
 transactions, will be successful. Fund may invest in the securities of 
 other investment companies, including exchange-traded funds, and in 
 exchange- traded notes.


 The Crow Point Global Dividend Plus Fund (the "Fund") is registered with 
 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a non-diversified, 
 management investment company, pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 
 1940. An investment in the Fund is subject to risk, including the loss 
 of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee the Fund will 
 achieve its investment objective. The Fund's shares may be more volatile 
 than the performance of a broadly diversified portfolio. The Fund is not 
 by itself a complete or balanced investment program.
 

 Market forces may result in shares trading at a significant premium or 
 discount to NAV. Although the shares are currently listed on an 
 exchange, there can be no assurance that an active trading market for 
 the shares will develop or be maintained.
 

 The Fund's performance is expected to be closely tied to social, 
 political, and economic conditions within Europe and to be more volatile 
 than the performance of more geographically diversified funds. An 
 investment in European securities can be adversely affected by a variety 
 of factors, among which are: restrictions on inflation rates, deficits, 
 interest rates, debt levels and fiscal and monetary controls imposed by 
 the European Union or European Monetary Union; historically high 
 unemployment and significant debt problems in certain European nations; 
 recently volatility in European financial markets due to concerns about 
 economic downturns or rising government debt levels. Currently, a 
 significant portion of the Index is allocated to securities of companies 
 in France, Germany and Spain.
 

 Recent events have adversely affected the exchange rate of the euro and 
 may continue to significantly affect every country in Europe, including 
 countries that do not use the euro. Changes in currency exchange rates 
 and the relative value of non-U.S. currencies will affect the value of 
 the Fund's investment and the value of your Fund Shares. Because the 
 Fund's NAV is determined in U.S. dollars, the Funds NAV could decline if 
 the currency of the non-U.S. market in which the Fund invests 
 depreciates against the U.S. dollar, even if the value of the Fund's 
 holdings, measured in the foreign currency, increases.

Recon Capital & Crow Point Partners launch Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund

Launches & Fundraising











Recon Capital, an investment firm and exchange traded fund (ETF) provider has expanded its product offerings by partnering with Crow Point Partners, a boutique investment manager with a long track record in global equity, alternative, and specialty fixed income strategies, to offer the Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund.
“Today, with yield and volatility curves at historic lows, investors face an inordinate amount of assymetric risk. Investment management firms need to provide products to help them. We believe GDPIX does that,” says Peter DeCaprio, the CEO and co-founder of Crow Point. The Crow Point Dividend Plus Fund is comprised of three strategic sleeves: a rules-based global long/short equity portfolio, which is the majority of the fund’s invested assets; a short duration, high-quality floating-rate bond sleeve; and a dynamic options overlay for additional income.

According to Garrett Paollela (pictured), CEO of Recon Capital and the fund’s adviser, says: “Closed-end funds could be an ideal structure for long/short strategies and the market is long overdue for this distinct product.” 

The long/short strategy seeks to create a short portfolio that minimises income and reinvests those short proceeds into a long portfolio that maximises income,” Paollela adds, “The closed-end fund structure gives a manager more flexibility than an open-end fund in constructing a long/short portfolio that results, for investors, in a balance between higher yields and risk mitigation.”

“We are excited to be working with Crow Point to use our expertise in options to deliver distinct and practical solutions for today’s yield buyer,” Paollela says. “Crow Point has a very experienced team ideally suited for this product. Managing duration exposure is a skill set that income investors will need in the years to come, and we are pleased to present a product that does that.“ 

Paollela adds: “Recon Capital is committed to using our operational infrastructure to deliver market-driven, value-added products that strive to meet the evolving needs of global investors and this product embodies that notion.
