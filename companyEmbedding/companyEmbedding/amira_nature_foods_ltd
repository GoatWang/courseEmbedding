			Rice is two species in the Poaceae (“true grass”) family, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima. These plants are native to tropical and subtropical southern and southeastern Asia and in Africa. Rice provides more than one fifth of the calories consumed by humans in their global diets. (The term “wild rice” can refer to the wild species of Oryza, but conventionally refers to species of the related genus Zizania, both wild and domesticated.) Rice is a monocarpic annual plant, growing to 1–1.8 m tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility. The grass has long, slender leaves 50–100 cm long and 2–2.5 cm broad. The small wind-pollinated flowers are produced in a branched arching to pendulous inflorescence 30–50 cm long. The seed is a grain (caryopsis) 5–12 mm long and 2–3 mm thick.
Rice is a staple for a large part of the world’s human population, especially in East and Southeast Asia, making it the most consumed cereal grain. Rice is the world’s largest crop (700 million metric tons in 2005), with maize (“corn”) (692 million metric tons in 2005) and wheat (626 million metric tons in 2005) behind it. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labour costs and high rainfall, as it is very labour-intensive to cultivate and requires plenty of water for irrigation, much like the licorice crops found in Eastern Europe. Rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on steep hillsides. Although its species are native to South Asia and certain parts of Africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures.
Genetic evidence has shown that rice originates from a single domestication 8,200–13,500 years ago, in the Pearl Rivervalley region of China. Previously, archaeological evidence had suggested that rice was domesticated in the Yangtze River valley region in China. From East Asia, rice spread to Southeast and South Asia. Rice was introduced to Europe through Western Asia, and to the Americas through European colonization.
		





Q: Where can I find your products?
A: Our products are available for sale across the country in most natural food and co-op stores, gourmet/specialty markets, chain grocery stores. Since we sell most of our rice through distributors, we may not know every store in a particular area that stocks our rice, but you can always call us to ask.
If our products are not sold at the store you choose to shop at, you might consider asking for our items to be brought in.
You can also find our products on the menus of many “white tablecloth” restaurants.
Q: What is Amira Foods Fair Trade Policy?
A: Fair trade is intended to foster an equitable and sustainable global system of production and trade. When we first began exporting our rice, fair-trade certified rice did not exist. However, we have always supported global sustainability and paid our small family farmers premium prices for their highest quality, highest nutrition heirloom rices.
Q: Should rice be soaked?
A: All grains contain phytic acid (an organic acid in which phosphorous is bound) in the outer layer or bran. Whole grains, in particular, may be difficult for some people to digest. As little as 7 hours of soaking in warm water will neutralize a large portion of phytic acid in grains and vastly improve the rice’s nutritional benefits.

			First of all, rice contains no gluten, which makes it one of the best non-allergic foods. The fact is that many people are intolerant to gluten which prevents them from taking in a lot of important nutrients. On the other hand, rice has no gluten whatsoever. This makes it possible for people who are allergic to gluten to take in many great nutrients rice contains, including different types of Vitamin B, D, calcium, fiber, iron, and a variety of minerals that are essential for our bodies.
Another health benefit of rice is related to the health of our heart. Bran oil made from rice contains powerful antioxidants that can aid in making our heart more resistant to heart-related diseases. Apart from this, bad cholesterol can be damaging for the health of the heart. Rice, on the other hand, can help you with lowering your cholesterol levels, as it does not contain bad cholesterol, making your heart even healthier.
The third benefit of eating rice regarding our health is related to carbohydrates. Rice contains a lot of carbohydrates that give our bodies the energy we need. So, you can enjoy all sorts of activities without having to worry about putting on extra pounds, due to the fact that the rice is very low in fat, salt, and sugar.
In fact, Ayurveda uses rice based diets in treating various imbalances in the body. Dal chawal is a nutritious meal, possessing the entire spectrum of amino acids, vitamins and minerals. It also accelerates fat burning. In fact, the essential amino acid methionine found pre-dominantly in rice helps mobilize fat from the liver. As India is dominantly vegetarian, getting proteins from rice, especially the essential amino acid methionine and the conditionally essential amino acid (becomes essential under conditions of stress) tyrosine is crucial for us. Diabetics should also eat rice since they need these proteins.
Rice contains all the amino acids essential for building and maintaining muscle tissue, and make up antibodies, enzymes, and hormones. These amino acids also help maintain healthy skin, hair, eyesight, and nousish the heart, lungs, tendons and ligaments, brain, nervous system and glands.
