Vendor to Watch: RepairTech Inc.








  
 Hatched by entrepreneurial college students, this IT management software vendor makes an affordable, entry-level RMM solution for managed service newcomers. By Rich Freeman  


Tweet




 
 IT’S ONLY A LITTLE MISLEADING to say that RepairTech Inc. was brought into being by the lure of free pizza. A more accurate telling of the San Jose, Calif.-based software maker’s story would begin when a teenager named Ian Alexander got a job fixing PCs. He loved working with technology, but hated running multiple diagnostic tools one after the other, and dreamed of creating a solution that would combine and automate all those processes.
A few years later and in college, Alexander saw a flyer on campus promoting the kickoff meeting for a product invention contest with a $15,000 first prize. There would be free pizza on hand. So he went to the meeting, submitted his computer repair automation idea, rounded up some collaborators, and created his dream solution. And then won the contest.

RepairTech Inc.Location: San Jose, Calif. Website: repairtechsolutions.com Description: This IT management software vendor makes an affordable, entry-level RMM solution for managed service newcomers.

Roughly a year later, in October 2012, RepairTech officially opened its doors, Alexander became its CEO, and that contest-winning product went on sale under the name TechSuite.
Today, RepairTech offers a second solution named Kabuto, which originated as a local monitoring agent that technicians can install on the PCs they service. If a virus strikes or hard drive begins failing, the system alerts the owner and reminds them who to call for assistance. “It puts their brand in front of a customer when they need it the most,” Alexander says.
Over time, RepairTech added remote monitoring, patch management, and anti-virus capabilities, turning what began as a sort of lead-generation tool into a lightweight RMM solution. Less configurable than better-known offerings, it’s also less expensive, making it an attractive option for managed service newcomers. “Kabuto at its core is designed to be plug-and-play,” Alexander says. “You don’t have to spend six months getting trained on how to use it.”
The system integrates with related third-party products including mHelpDesk and PC Repair Tracker, as well as Autotask, ConnectWise, and a PSA solution for computer break-fix specialists named RepairShopr.
It’s gaining new capabilities all the time too. Backup functionality is coming soon, for example, with more to follow this year. “We’re going to be adding tons of stuff that’s going to bring more feature parity” with the industry leaders, says Alexander, who now heads a fast-growing company with more than 1,000 customers. “It’s been a fun journey,” he says.
