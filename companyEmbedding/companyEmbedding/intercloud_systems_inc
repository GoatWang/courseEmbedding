New Catalyst For InterCloud Systems Inc (OTCMKTS:ICLDD)

InterCloud Systems Inc (OTCMKTS:ICLDD) traded up to finish the week after news broke of $1 million contract coming in. ICLDD is in the cloud network business – detailed more below – and currently has a $2.8M market cap. The company has been up and down most of the summer, but this news could be the catalyst it needs to right the ship.
ICLDD’s CEO stated, “we are pleased with the continued flow of new business. I am personally, along with the Board of Directors and our management team committed to our continued restructuring. As we have previously reported, we continue to reduce debt, salaries and other SG&A expenses. Our near term goals continue to focus on growing revenue, fixing our balance sheet and becoming cash flow positive.”
InterCloud Systems Inc (OTCMKTS:ICLDD) is a leading provider of cloud networking orchestration and automation, for Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) cloud environments to the telecommunications service provider (carrier) and corporate enterprise markets through cloud solutions and professional services. InterCloud’s cloud solutions offer enterprise and service-provider customers the opportunity to adopt an operational expense model by outsourcing cloud deployment and management to InterCloud rather than the capital expense model that has dominated in recent decades in IT infrastructure management.

The other aspect of the business that has potential is its X-Barrier product, which protects networks in the hospital setting. Here is their CEO, Mark Munro, again:
“For healthcare organizations, network vulnerability can quickly become an issue of life and death. Traditional perimeter-based network protection solutions are efficient today but do not provide the necessary level of protection due to the complex nature of Health Care networks and vulnerable applications. Our product provides an automated way to segment, survey and protect a healthcare facility and hospital campus not only from the outside threats, but also from the internal networking objects already penetrated by hackers.”
X-Barrier is a part of InterCloud’s group of network management and automation products for Next-Gen Software Defined Networks (SDN) and legacy network environments. X-Barrier targets the network security vulnerability of the Healthcare vertical.
According to the company, X-Barrier utilizes a new approach to network threat detection, which is based on Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Analysis of network connection data is performed by utilizing non-deterministic algorithms, which allows detection of both known and unknown network threats and attacks.  X-Barrier does not require any pre-configuration as it utilizes a self-learning approach to data analysis and constantly adjusts its detection models.
InterCloud Systems Inc (OTCMKTS:ICLDD) is coming back down to earth a little bit and that is probably because traders are starting to see the debt and the financings this company did in the past. They are a tough sell after you dig into the books, but Munro and the team are trying to turn the ship around. We will be watching to see if that is possible.

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.
