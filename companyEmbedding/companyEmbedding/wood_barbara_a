									Reclaimed wood flooring and other wood products in Santa Barbara								
Written by Rob


 
 


Hey Good People – Rob here.
I can’t get enough of hearing about innovation when it comes to milling hardwood flooring, or the creativity of members of the wood industry in general.  This is particularly true when I hear stories about how creative people are getting when it comes to sustainability and approaches to green building practices.  I like that certain sectors of industry are beginning to realize that single-minded profit seeking denies them, and their customers, of many wider benefits.  And some are way ahead when it comes to a more holistic approach to sourcing building materials in their own communities.
Here’s another great article about reclaimed hardwood products out of Santa Barbara, California.
Rob Bjorkland mills his own wood, a result of what is called urban forestry.  This means that trees which normally would be subject to the wood chipper after falling to disease or other natural causes in neighborhoods are actually given new life through reclamation and re-use.  And of course, the milling of this wood goes hand-in-hand with an aggressive re-planting program.
I think the wood flooring industry has been painted with a pretty broad brush when it comes to sustainability issues.  For me, it’s great to see that a traditional product made in a traditional way, is actually subject to a pretty modern approach, with eco-friendly attitudes firmly in place.  And it’s also important to note that innovation in the wood flooring and wood products industries are done at the grass roots level, which is true to the green building movement in general.
It’s clear that this is a lucrative business.  Yet, practices like these also add to local communities too, not just short term profits.  And there is respect for natural resources and wood species, and what they offer neighborhoods, outside of their role as wood flooring and other products.   Re-planting fallen trees, and making use of available materials which had traditionally been discarded infuse new life into local economies and make sure that urban forests and green areas are sustained for the future as well.  I personally find this long view tendency to be really encouraging.
What do you think, Good People?  Are there similar efforts in your own communities with regard to replanting programs and reclaimed wood practices?
Tell me all about it!
Cheers,
Rob.

 Millions of years ago, a meteorite fell to earth and a beautiful blue stone shattered from it. One hundred thousand years ago, a girl named Tall One found the crystal on the African plain---and it formed her destiny, as well as the destiny of generations to come. From ancient Israel to imperial Rome, medieval England, fifteenth-century Germany, the eighteenth-century Caribbean, and the nineteenth-century American West, the destiny of the stone and the history of the world unfold. Each story is full of the betrayals and obsessions of the human heart, and the quests of the human spirit. In The Blessing Stone, Barbara Wood has both told the intimate details of her characters' lives and created a sense of the epic sweep of human history.

"All in all, an absorbing adventure tale.""All in all, an absorbing adventure tale." --"Booklist" on "The Blessing Stone"All in all, an absorbing adventure tale. "Booklist on The Blessing Stone"""All in all, an absorbing adventure tale." --Booklist on The Blessing Stone

From the Back Cover
From the #1 internationally bestselling author comes a sweeping epic that chronicles the history of the world through the destiny of a mysterious blue stone . . ."Sweeping epic about the history of humanity . . . Wood crafts vivid sketches of ordinary women who triumph over a prescribed destiny . . . packs them with historical details that should keep readers interested." --Publishers Weekly "Ambitious . . . both thoughtful and playful . . . intelligent and entertaining." --San Jose Mercury News  "In each era, Wood creates genuine, engaging characters whose stories are fascinating." --Library Journal Millions of years ago, a meteorite fell to earth and a beautiful blue stone shattered from it. One hundred thousand years ago, a girl named Tall One found the crystal on the African plain---and it formed her destiny, as well as the destiny of generations to come. From ancient Israel to imperial Rome, medieval England, fifteenth-century Germany, the eighteenth-century Caribbean, and the nineteenth-century American West, the destiny of the stone and the history of the world unfold. Each story is full of the betrayals and obsessions of the human heart, and the quests of the human spirit. In The Blessing Stone, Barbara Wood has both told the intimate details of her characters' lives and created a sense of the epic sweep of human history.

5.0 out of 5 starsSo much happening!

  Hi! What an unusual book, to follow the path of a beautiful stone from its appearance at the beginning of life on earth all the way to the Gold Rush in the United States, we get to discover the life of all its owners, it is a beautiful innovative novel. Loads of characters, various plots all relevant and entertaining. I would highly recommend this read!

2.0 out of 5 starsI read and enjoyed THE DREAMING and YESTERDAY'S CHILD by her


      By
    
The Bookavid

 on 19 Jan. 2016Format: Paperback


In THE BLESSING STONE, a magical blue stone gets handed down from generation to generation and helps eight women pursue their dreams.What intrigued me: I read and enjoyed THE DREAMING and YESTERDAY'S CHILD by her. She's the only author whose history-inspired books I'll ever read.Wait, these are short stories!Essentially, this is a short story collection. The only thing all eight stories have in common is that the blue stone impacts all eight women's lives. Exactly this is also the biggest flaw of the novel. When I picked this up, I wasn't expecting to read eight stories, I was hoping for one.Every 60 pages you are forced to get to know new characters and listen to their stories, which are somewhat the same. We always have a couple that gets separated and a woman who's left to fend for her own and "save herself". I do love that Wood decided to write such a feminist and empowering book with a little magical twist element.It's not you, it's meI do like the idea, but I wasn't prepared for this. I was hoping for an actual full-length novel with the same characters and not a retelling of humanity's history with the only alteration being the mysterious stone added to the picture. All stories somehow seem to have some kind of moral, even lecturing undertone and I just wasn't invested in the idea to the extent that I cared to read the same premise over and over again, simply throughout different centuries.The writing is superb, the stories are great and interesting, but after the third of fourth story I just found myself completely drifting while reading and not really caring anymore about neither the stone, nor the stories.Read more ›

  I loved the stories  of the holders of the stone  and was eager to read the next chapter ,  I was slightly disappointed in the last chapter, feeling it was as if the  author ran out of  ideas . But on the positive  side it was left  open for a follow on book which I would certainly buy ,

  I've loved this book for years but had only ever read the French translation (I live in France) I bought this one for my daughter who wanted to read it in English, it's just as excellent and we've thoroughly enjoyed it again :))

Purchase & Payment Process







 Once you decide that you would like to purchase an item, or items from Middlebury Consignment and Home Design you will add those items to your cart and proceed to checkout. At that point you will be directed to a new page to fill out all of your information for purchase. However, our company will not be charging ANY credit card information at this point. Instead, that product or products will be put on hold for 24 hours. A representative from our company will then contact you within the next 24 hours to conclude the sale. We do not take credit card information directly over the internet because our sales representative needs to calculate the delivery costs for the item to be shipped to you. This does not apply if you are going to pick up the item from our store. We have a local in house delivery service for products being shipped within the state and we also have companies that delivery for us out of state. Once we agree upon delivery cost we can then finalize the sale. If we do not reach an agreement on the transaction then the credit card will not be charged and the product will go back in stock on our website.
