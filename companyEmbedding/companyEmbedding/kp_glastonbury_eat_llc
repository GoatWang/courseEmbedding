“Reputation far exceeds the product”


Reviewed March 31, 2017




When it opened it was the fresh pizza option in town. Now there are several and this one has shown a noticeable drop off in quality and an increase in price. Pizzas - their claim to fame - are bland; crust usually undercooked and limp. Main courses are simply not worth it. You're better off at Bertucci's for the money. My recommendation? Pass on this one.

“Went 2 Nights In A Row !!”


Reviewed February 11, 2017



via mobile




I'm pretty skeptical when it comes to my food now.. but I wanted pizza & wasn't leaving the area due to the snow storm so here we are! I got a large pizza fair prizing but once you open the box.. boy the pizza is BIGG & filling so you are getting your money's worth! The next day I wanted fried mac & cheese & wings.. guess who I called !? & That was even better.. my lady got a grinder & fries & she said that was great too ! Believe me she's a tough critic when it comes to food so I vouch for her! I definitely recommend them keep it up I'll be back for sure !!

“Spring Pizza Very Good”


Reviewed January 9, 2017




I've only been to this restaurant for take-out pizza, though I've always ordered in the restaurant and waited for my order to be ready. I typically order the spring pizza, which is heavy on vegetables. It is very good. It is always delivered hot and is not too greasy.The restaurant also has a very good craft beer selection. The selection is posted on blackboards in the front room. I have had a beer several times there while waiting for my pizza to be cooked. They always seem to have a place up front to sit if you want to drink your beer while waiting for your pizza.I've had plenty of time to observe while waiting for my pizza. Cleanliness of the restaurant is good. Service appears to be good, though I've never been there during a peak period. The aquarium in the front is fun to watch. They have a covered area to eat outside.Prices aren't horrible, but they aren't a bargain either. As I recall, my large pizza was between $18 and $20, and my beers have been around $5 or $6.

Our Testimonials Speak For Themselves 







Mary Noon, MS, RDN, CDNRegistered Dietitian/NutritionistConnecticut State Dietitian of the Year 2015Among all the gluten free products lining our store shelves these days, this one is a stand out.  Perfect Pancake Plus is packed with healthy ingredients which provide a well-balanced breakfast choice or anytime favorite. As a registered dietitian/nutritionist who counsels those with Celiac disease and gluten intolerance, I will recommend this product for its health benefits.Unlike some gluten free foods made with white rice flour and cornstarch, this product is made with premium ingredients. It is high in protein due to the almond, pea and egg white content, essential for muscle support and meal satiety.  The fat profile is complementary to heart health dominated by monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats. Fiber, known as a key component in gastro-intestinal health, is supplied by nuts, seeds and peas. These ingredients make Perfect Pancake Plus fit in with not only the new U. S. Dietary Guidelines, but also make it well suited for top-rated Mediterranean and DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diets. Everyone can find some reason to eat this new creation; those cutting carbohydrates will favor it for its low glycemic index, and others will be pleased to find a product without  allergens such as dairy, soy and wheat.  Additionally, the product is made in a dedicated facility with no concern for cross contamination! Did I mention it’s GMO free and minimally processed too?The Perfect Pancake Plus makes pancakes that are delicious and nutritious. Add fresh berries, a sprinkle of cinnamon and top with maple syrup for a tasty breakfast, or make it savory with some sliced scallions and fresh herbs in place of bread at mealtime. Either way, I will be recommending the versatile Perfect Pancake Plus as part of a healthy diet.Leann CoppolaMother of TwoGood Morning, My name is Leann Coppola and my family works closely with Peter Solinger of Glastonbury, CT. We recently received a pack of Banana Nut Perfect Pancake Mix from Pete and wanted to send along our praise! As a mother of a four-month and two-year old, I've been on a mission to establish a healthy, natural diet for my kids from day one. That was a lot easier when it was just the one kid. Now now that we also have a newborn, sometimes I find myself choosing between convenience and health.With the Perfect Pancake Mix, I don't have to make that choice--I get the best of both worlds! It's been a game-changer.This product allows me to make a super healthy breakfast, with the convenience of just adding one ingredient. It's fast and healthy!My daughter LOVES the banana nut pancakes and I feel completely triumphant giving them to her. This will certainly be a staple in our pantry moving forward. Thank you for the great product!Happy Consumer, Leann Coppola

"Easy to work with. Did exactly what he said and on time. Made changes when necessary. Trustworthy! Kept me informed of progress. Price and allowances were more than reasonable. Additional cost for any additional work was also reasonable. Would not hesitate to hire again."
- Steven P., Berlin, CT


















 The before siding looks dated...and unattractiveand in desperate need of some TLC.After! With the right contractor,  it looks like new constructioneven the most dated sighting can be transformed into a more beautifuland energy efficient home.Old siding often hides...underlying issues...that may decrease your homes value.New siding protects your familyand investment...for generations to come.
