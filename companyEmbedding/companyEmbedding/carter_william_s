 Carter-Williams Igniting Basketball Card Market
November 6, 2013 By Rich Mueller It’s been a good couple of weeks for Philadelphia 76ers fans, who have quickly fallen in love with their first round draft pick.  Collectors and investors have too but if absence makes the heart grow fonder, they’ll be ga-ga over Michael Carter-Williams by the All-Star break.  The Syracuse product is off to a phenomenal start, scoring 99 points in his first five games, the most since Kevin Durant in 2007-08.
The list of the hottest  Carter-Williams basketball cards is a short one simply because, well, he doesn’t have very many yet.  Official NBA licensee Panini will spread numerous products out over the next 11 months, all of which will likely have Carter-Williams rookie cards in them.  For now, there are cards from the Hoops and Prestige brands along with the requisite parallels and a certified autograph but that’s all.
Prices have soared since opening night.  After the first one sold for $55, the few Hoops Signature cards to hit eBay since have been selling for more than $300.  The Kobe All Rookie Team insert cards have been hot as have the Hoops parallels.  The Gold Parallels sold early for just a few dollars but now bring $25 and up.
The 11th overall pick by Philadelphia back in June, Carter-Williams played only two seasons at Syracuse but has proven himself ready for the pros. He was named NBA Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played from Oct. 29 through Nov. 3.  Shaquille O’Neal (1992-93) is the only other rookie in the history of the award to be named Player of the Week to start his career.
In addition to nearly 20 points per game, he’s been a solid distributor, a decent rebounder and a pretty fair defender.
In his NBA debut against the two-time defending NBA Champion Miami Heat on Oct. 30, Carter-Williams had 22 points, 12 assists, seven rebounds and nine steals.  His first basket was a breakaway dunk. The nine steals tied the franchise record and was the most by any player in an NBA debut.   The last player to have at least 20 points, five rebounds and five assists in an NBA debut was LeBron James in 2003-04.
Here’s a look at the hottest Carter-Williams cards right now on eBay.

Made for Mason Williams by luthier Billy Cheatwood and the head prop designer for ABC-TV. Williams "pick-synced" his hit song "Classical Gas" on this guitar on his "Just Friends" TV special, and he also played it on "The Smothers Brothers Show" in 1974. One one occasion he performed with a goldfish swimming around in the guitar. The guitar was on its way to the dumpster when John Hartford rescued it. When Hartford died, it went to his son Jamie and then to Nashville producer/guitarist Mark Howard. It comes with a letter from Howard and a publicity photo of Williams playing it on the TV set. In a hardshell case

Furniture upholstered in mohair will not have welting (piping) or topstitching.
CARE INSTRUCTIONS
Base

Clean with a soft dry or slightly damp cloth; dry thoroughly.
Avoid harsh cleaners (including ammonia-based glass cleaners) and abrasives as they will damage the finish.

Fabric

Brush or vacuum regularly (use a nonmetallic stiff-bristle brush).
Protect from direct sunlight to prevent fading.
Dab spills immediately with a soft white cloth dampened with distilled water (not tap water). Test fabric cleaners first in an inconspicuous area. Do not saturate fabric with cleaner. Pat instead of rub to avoid altering texture. Clean stain from outer edge to prevent “circling.”
Thorough cleaning is recommended every 12 to 24 months. Do not wait for severe soiling. We recommend a professional in-home upholstery cleaning service.
Do not remove cushion casings for cleaning. Unlike slipcovers, upholstered casings are not meant to be removed.

Leather

Never use detergents, polishes, preservers or saddle soap. They can remove natural oils.
Dust or vacuum for routine maintenance.
Do not place in direct sunlight; it will lighten or discolor leather over time.
Dab spills immediately with a soft white cloth dampened in distilled water (not tap water). If spill penetrates leather, use lukewarm distilled water and a soft white cloth to massage stain and surrounding area. Blot with a dry cloth and allow leather to air dry.
Most surface scratches will fade over time if you rub them with your fingertips. Friction and heat from rubbing helps to redistribute wax in surrounding areas to cover the scratch. Not all scratches have the same depth, and this may not work on deeper scratches.

Composition & Construction

Our leather upholstered products are constructed from aniline leather. Only the top 5% of hides can be made into aniline leather, making it the finest available. The full-grain or top-grain leathers are soaked in transparent nontoxic dye, with no subsequent pigmented finish coats applied. Dye penetrates the hides, letting the natural grain show through. Our ivory leather, white pebbled leather and white faux ostrich are exceptions to this process; they are semi-aniline dyed, with a layer of pigment applied afterwards.
Anilines have natural markings that vary from hide to hide. They also have color variations due to the leather’s ability to accept dyes differently in various areas of a hide. Markings and shading distinguish genuine leather from man-made materials. Appreciating shade differences among hides also means appreciating them on individual furniture pieces, because no two pieces can be produced from a single hide.
Our leathers appeal to customers who find the natural color variations, markings and patina of pure aniline leathers unique and beautiful. They may not appeal to customers who want uniform color and surface commonly seen on less expensive leathers that are heavily corrected and pigmented.
