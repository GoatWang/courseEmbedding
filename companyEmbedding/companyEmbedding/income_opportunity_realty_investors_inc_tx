(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  This Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management's beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words "anticipate", "believe", "expect", "intend", "may", "might", "plan", "estimate", "project", "should", "will", "result" and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated, or projected. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.  Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:   general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants' financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);   risks associated with the availability and terms of construction and mortgage financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments;   demand for apartments and commercial properties in the Company's markets and the effect on occupancy and rental rates;   the Company's ability to obtain financing, enter into joint venture arrangements in relation to or self-fund the development or acquisition of properties;   risks associated with the timing and amount of property sales and the resulting gains/losses associated with such sales;   failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully;   risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities);   risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates, and volatility in the securities markets;   costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws and regulations;   potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination; and   risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.  The risks included here are not exhaustive. Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements, include among others, the factors listed and described in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K, which investors should review. There have been no changes from the risk factors previously described in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.  Other sections of this report may also include suggested factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such matters; nor can we assess the impact of all such matters on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise as we file them with the SEC.  Overview  We are an externally advised and managed real estate investment company that currently owns land held for development or sale. As of September 30, 2013, we owned or had interests in 178.1 acres of land, located in Texas and held for future development or sale. We have no employees.  Our primary source of revenue is from the interest income on over $25.4 million of notes receivable due from related parties.  We have historically engaged in and may continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisition and dispositions. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in our best interest.  Pillar Income Asset Management, Inc. ("Pillar") is the Company's external Advisor and Cash Manager. Although the Board of Directors is directly responsible for managing the affairs of IOT, and for setting the policies which guide it, the day-to-day operations of IOT are performed by Pillar, as the contractual Advisor, under the supervision of the Board. Pillar's duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities and arranging debt and equity financing for the Company with third party lenders and investors. Additionally, Pillar serves as a consultant to the Board with regard to their decisions in connection with IOT's business plan and investment policy. Pillar also serves as an Advisor and Cash Manager to TCI and ARL.  Critical Accounting Policies  We present our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). The FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") is the single source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP. As of the effective date, we no longer refer to the authoritative guidance dictating its accounting methodologies under the previous accounting standards hierarchy. Instead, we refer to the ASC Codification as the sole source of authoritative literature.  The accompanying financial statements include our accounts, our subsidiaries, generally all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which we have a controlling interest. Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), in accordance with the provisions and guidance of ASC Topic 810 "Consolidation", whereby we have determined that we are a primary beneficiary of the VIE and meet certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders, as a group, lack adequate decision making ability, the obligation to absorb expected losses or residual returns of the entity, or have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests. The primary beneficiary generally is the entity that provides financial support and bears a majority of the financial risks, authorizes certain capital transactions, or makes operating decisions that materially affect the entity's financial results. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; our and the other investors' ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the VIE; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions.  For entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the entities are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our share of the net earnings or losses of these entities are included in net income. Our investment in TCI Eton Square, LP is accounted for under the equity method.  Real Estate  Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-market" and "below-market" leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 805 "Business Combinations", and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost.  We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.  We record acquired "above-market" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by ASC Topic 835-20 "Interest - Capitalization of Interest" and ASC Topic 970 "Real Estate - General". The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We cease capitalization when a building is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use, but no later than one year from the cessation of major construction activity.  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.  ASC Topic 360 "Property, Plant and Equipment" requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property's net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our Board of Directors, or a committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.  Depreciation and Impairment  Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.  Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods.  Recognition of Revenue  Our revenues are composed of interest income on notes receivable. In accordance with ASC 805 "Business Combinations", we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place and "above-market" and "below-market" leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases, as applicable.  Revenue Recognition on the Sale of Real Estate  Sales and the associated gains or losses of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 360-20, "Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sale". The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in ASC Topic 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.  Non-Performing Notes Receivable  We consider a note receivable to be non-performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Interest Recognition on Notes Receivable  We record interest income as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements.  Allowance for Estimated Losses  We assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis, of which the assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. See Note 4 "Notes and Interest Receivable from Related Parties" for details on our notes receivable.  Fair Value of Financial Instruments We apply the guidance in ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and includes three levels defined as follows: Level 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices for identical and unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.  A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Related parties  We apply ASC Topic 805, "Business Combinations", to evaluate business relationships. Related parties are persons or entities who have one or more of the following characteristics, which include entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, trust for the benefit of persons including principal owners of the entities and members of their immediate families, management personnel of the entity and members of their immediate families and other parties with which the entity may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the decision making of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, or affiliates of the entity.  Results of Operations  The following discussion is based on our "Statement of Operations" for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, as included in Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements" of this report. It is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our net income applicable to common shares. Instead, we have focused on significant fluctuations within our operations that we feel are relevant to obtain an overall understanding of the change in income applicable to common shareholders.  Our current operations consist of land held for future development or sale. Our operating expenses relate mainly to the administration and maintenance costs associated with the land held for development or sale.  We also have other income and expense items. We receive interest income from the funds deposited with our Advisor at a rate of prime plus 1%. We have receivables from related parties which also provide interest income. Our other significant expense item is from the mortgage expense which includes interest payments on the debt secured by our land portfolio.  Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2013 to the same period ended 2012  We had net income of $625,000 or $0.15 per diluted earnings per share for the period ended September 30, 2013, as compared to net income of $356,000 million or $0.08 per diluted earnings per share for the same period ended 2012.  Revenues  Land held for development or sale is our sole operating segment. There was no income generated from this segment for the three months ended September 30, 2013, nor for the prior period ended 2012.  Expenses  Property operating expenses were $49,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $35,000, as compared to the prior period operating expenses of $14,000. This increase was due to expenses for professional services relating to the land portfolio.  General and administrative expenses were $192,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $150,000, as compared to the prior period general and administrative expenses of $42,000. This increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and the cost reimbursements to our Advisor.  Other income (expense)  Interest income was $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $0.4 million as compared to the prior period interest income of $1.0 million. This increase was due to an agreement made on January 1, 2013, whereby the Company extended the maturity on the surplus cash flow notes receivable from UHF for an additional term of five years in exchange for the early termination of the preferred interest rate. The original notes gave a five-year period of preferred interest rate at 5.25%, before returning to the original note rate of 12.0%.  Mortgage and loan interest was $297,000 for the three months ending September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $21,000 as compared to the prior period mortgage and loan interest expense of $276,000. The lender for the Mercer/Travelers land mortgage was applying 100% of the monthly debt service to principal until the October 2012 extension of the forbearance agreement. The lender reallocated the payments to accrued interest, thereby changing the amount of interest owed.  There were no earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries and investees relating to IOT's investment in TCI Eton Square, LP for the three months ended September 30, 2013. This investment was accounted for under the equity method and recognized its portion of the prior period earnings until IOT recorded the sale of its investment on April 8, 2013.  Discontinued operations relates to properties that were either sold or held for sale as of the period ended September 30, 2013. There were no properties sold in 2013. The gain on sale of the properties, if applicable, is also included in discontinued operations for those years.  The following table summarizes revenue and expense information for the properties sold and held for sale (dollars in thousands):   For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2013 2012 Revenues: Rental and other property revenues $ - $ - Expenses: Property operating expense - 1 General and administrative - 40 Total operating expenses - 41 Loss from discontinued operations - (41 ) Income tax benefit - 14 Net loss from discontinued operations $ - $ (27 )  Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to the same period ended 2012  We had net income of $2.0 million or $0.47 per diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to a net income of $1.9 million or $0.44 per diluted earnings per share for the same nine months ended 2012.  Revenues  Expenses  Property operating expenses were $72,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $12,000, as compared to the prior period operating expenses of $60,000. This increase was due to an increase in professional services relating to the land portfolio, offset by a decrease in POA fees.  General and administrative expenses were $536,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $253,000 as compared to the prior period expenses of $283,000. This increase relates to the other portfolio and was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and the cost reimbursements to our Advisor.  Other income (expense)  Interest income was $4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $0.4 million as compared to the prior period interest income of $3.9 million. This increase was due to an agreement made on January 1, 2013, whereby the Company extended the maturity on the surplus cash flow notes receivable from UHF for an additional term of five years in exchange for the early termination of the preferred interest rate. The original notes gave a five-year period of preferred interest rate at 5.25%, before returning to the original note rate of 12.0%.  Mortgage loan and interest expense was $879,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This represents an increase of $51,000 as compared to the prior period expense of $828,000. The lender for the Mercer/Travelers land mortgage was applying 100% of the monthly debt service to principal until the October 2012 extension of the forbearance agreement. The lender reallocated the payments to accrued interest, thereby changing the amount of interest owed.  There were no earnings from unconsolidated subsidiaries and investees relating to IOT's investment in TCI Eton Square, LP for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This investment was accounted for under the equity method and recognized its portion of the prior period earnings until IOT recorded the sale of its investment on April 8, 2013.  . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws, principally, but not only, under the captions "Business", "Risk Factors" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". We caution investors that any forward-looking statements in this report, or which management may make orally or in writing from time to time, are based on management's beliefs and on assumptions made by, and information currently available to, management. When used, the words "anticipate," "believe," "expect," "intend," "may," "might," "plan," "estimate," "project," "should," "will," "result" and similar expressions which do not relate solely to historical matters are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions and are not guarantees of future performance, which may be affected by known and unknown risks, trends, uncertainties and factors that are beyond our control. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated, estimated or projected. We caution you that, while forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs when we make them, they are not guarantees of future performance and are impacted by actual events when they occur after we make such statements. We expressly disclaim any responsibility to update our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Accordingly, investors should use caution in relying on past forward-looking statements, which are based on results and trends at the time they are made, to anticipate future results or trends.  Some of the risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements include, among others, the following:  ? general risks affecting the real estate industry (including, without limitation, the inability to enter into or renew leases, dependence on tenants' financial condition, and competition from other developers, owners and operators of real estate);  ? risks associated with the availability and terms of financing and the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments;  ? failure to manage effectively our growth and expansion into new markets or to integrate acquisitions successfully;  ? risks and uncertainties affecting property development and construction (including, without limitation, construction delays, cost overruns, inability to obtain necessary permits and public opposition to such activities);  ? risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies, increases in interest rates and volatility in the securities markets;  ? costs of compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other similar laws and regulations;  ? potential liability for uninsured losses and environmental contamination;  ? risks associated with our dependence on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed; and  ? the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, including those described under the Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors".  The risks included herein are not exhaustive. Other sections of this report, including Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Investors should also refer to our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for future periods and current reports on Form 8-K as we file them with the SEC, and to other materials we may furnish to the public from time to time through Forms 8-K or otherwise.  Overview  Our primary business is in real estate holdings and investment in mortgage receivables. Land held for development or sale is our sole operating segment. At December 31, 2016, our land consisted of 131.1 acres of land held subject to sales contract. All of our land holdings are located in Farmers Branch, Texas. The principal source of revenue for the Company is interest income on over $23.7 million of note receivables due from related parties.  Since April 30, 2011, Pillar is the Company's external Advisor and Cash Manager under a contractual arrangement that is reviewed annually by our Board of Directors. Pillar's duties include, but are not limited to, locating, evaluating and recommending real estate and real estate-related investment opportunities. Pillar also arranges, for IOT's benefit, debt and equity financing with third party lenders and investors. As the contractual Advisor, Pillar is compensated by IOT under an Advisory Agreement. The Company has no employees. Employees of Pillar render services to IOT in accordance with the terms of the Advisory Agreement. This Advisory Agreement is more fully described in Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance-The Advisor. Pillar also serves as an Advisor and Cash Manager to ARL and TCI.  We have historically engaged in and may continue to engage in certain business transactions with related parties, including but not limited to asset acquisition, dispositions and financings. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's length basis due to the absence of free market forces that naturally exist in business dealings between two or more unrelated entities. Related party transactions may not always be favorable to our business and may include terms, conditions and agreements that are not necessarily beneficial to or in our best interest.  Critical Accounting Policies  We present our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").  The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include our accounts, our subsidiaries, generally all of which are wholly-owned, and all entities in which we have a controlling interest. Arrangements that are not controlled through voting or similar rights are accounted for as a Variable Interest Entity ("VIE"), in accordance with the provisions and guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810 "Consolidation", whereby we have determined that we are a primary beneficiary of the VIE and meet certain criteria of a sole general partner or managing member as identified in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 04-5, Investor's Accounting for an Investment in a Limited Partnership when the Investor is the Sole General Partner and the Limited Partners have Certain Rights ("EITF 04-5"). VIEs are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders as a group lack adequate decision making ability, the obligation to absorb expected losses or residual returns of the entity, or have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests. The primary beneficiary generally is the entity that provides financial support and bears a majority of the financial risks, authorizes certain capital transactions, or makes operating decisions that materially affect the entity's financial results. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; our and the other investors' ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the VIE; and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of us and the other investors. Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions. As of December 31, 2016, IOT is not the primary beneficiary of a VIE.  The Company does not have any entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary.  Real Estate  Upon acquisitions of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets, including land, buildings, tenant improvements, "above-market" and "below-market" leases, origination costs, acquired in-place leases, other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with ASC 805 "Business Combinations", and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost.  We assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. We also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles, including acquired in-place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value, including (but not limited to) the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants, the tenants' credit quality and expectations of lease renewals. Based on our acquisitions to date, our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial.  We record acquired "above-market" and "below-market" leases at their fair values (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) equal to the difference between (1) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (2) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases.  Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease. Factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related expenses.  Transfers to or from TCI or other related parties reflect a sales price equal to the cost basis in the asset at the time of the sale.  Depreciation and Impairment  Real estate is stated at depreciated cost. The cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property, legal fees and other acquisition costs. Costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized. Capitalized development costs include interest, property taxes, insurance, and other project costs incurred during the period of development.  Management reviews its long-lived assets used in operations for impairment when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates impairment in value. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. If such impairment is present, an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. If we determine that impairment has occurred, the affected assets must be reduced to their face value.  ASC 360 "Property, Plant and Equipment" requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold, or otherwise qualify as "held for sale," be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and the Company will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale. The components of the property's net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain (or loss) upon the disposition of the property held for sale, operating results, depreciation and interest expense (if the property is subject to a secured loan). We generally consider assets to be "held for sale" when the transaction has been approved by the Company's Board of Directors, or its Executive Committee thereof, and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale, such that the property sale within one year is considered probable. Following the classification of a property as "held for sale," no further depreciation is recorded on the assets.  A variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition, development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. Our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by ASC 835-20 "Interest - Capitalization of Interest" and ASC 970 "Real Estate-General". The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the receipt of certificates of occupancy, but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity. We cease capitalization on the portion (1) substantially completed and (2) occupied or held available for occupancy, and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction.  Recognition of Revenue  Our revenues are composed largely of interest income on notes receivable.  Revenue Recognition on the Sale of Real Estate  Sales and the associated gains or losses of real estate assets are recognized in accordance with the provisions of ASC 360-20, "Property, Plant and Equipment - Real Estate Sale". The specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in ASC 360-20 related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties. If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the revenue or gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance, leasing, deposit, installment or cost recovery methods, as appropriate, until the full revenue recognition sales criteria are met.  Non-performing Notes Receivable  The Company considers a note receivable to be non-performing when the maturity date has passed without principal repayment and the borrower is not making interest payments in accordance with the terms of the agreement.  Interest recognition on Notes Receivable  We record interest income as earned in accordance with the terms of the related loan agreements.  Allowance for Estimated Losses  We assess the collectability of notes receivable on a periodic basis, of which the assessment consists primarily of an evaluation of cash flow projections of the borrower to determine whether estimated cash flows are sufficient to repay principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the note. We recognize impairments on notes receivable when it is probable that principal and interest will not be received in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. The amount of the impairment to be recognized generally is based on the fair value of the partnership's real estate that represents the primary source of loan repayment. (See Note 3, below, Notes and Interest Receivable from Related Parties, for details on our notes receivable.)  Fair Value Measurement  The Company applies the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, to the valuation of real estate assets. These provisions define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a transaction between market participants at the measurement date, establish a hierarchy that prioritizes the information used in developing fair value estimates and require disclosure of fair value measurements by level within the fair value hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3 measurements), such as the reporting entity's own data.  The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date and includes three levels defined as follows:  Level 1-Unadjusted quoted prices for identical and unrestricted assets or liabilities in active markets.  Level 2-Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.  Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management reviews the carrying values of our properties and mortgage notes receivable at least annually and whenever events or a change in circumstances indicates that impairment may exist. Impairment is considered to exist if the future cash flow from a property (undiscounted and without interest) is less than the carrying amount of the property. The property review generally includes: (1) selective property inspections; (2) a review of the property's current rents compared to market rents; (3) a review of the property's expenses;  Related parties  We apply ASC 805, Business Combinations, to evaluate business relationships. Related parties are persons or entities who have one or more of the following characteristics, which include entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, trust for the benefit of persons including principal owners of the entities and members of their immediate families, management personnel of the entity and members of their immediate families and other parties with which the entity may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the decision making of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests, or affiliates of the entity.  Contractual Obligations  At December 31, 2016, the Company had no outstanding debt, lease or purchase obligations.  Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements  In May 2014, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 ("ASU 2014-09"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, was issued. This new guidance established a new single comprehensive revenue recognition model and provides for enhanced disclosures. Under the new guidance, the nature, timing and amount of revenue recognized for certain transactions could differ from those recognized under existing accounting guidance. This new guidance does not affect revenue recognized under lease contracts. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on its financial position and results of operations, if any.  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02 ("ASU 2016-02"), Leases. This guidance establishes a new model for accounting for leases and provides for enhanced disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its financial position and results of operations, if any.  Results of Operations  The following discussion is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Statement of Operations, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 from Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our net income applicable to common shares. Instead, we have focused on significant fluctuations within our operations that we feel are relevant to obtain an overall understanding of the change in income applicable to common shareholders.  Our current operations consist of land held subject to a sales contract. Our operating expenses consist primarily of general and administrative costs such as audit and legal fees and administrative fees paid to a related party.  We also have other income and expense items. We receive interest income from the funds deposited with our Advisor at a rate of prime plus 1.0%. We have receivables from related parties which also provide interest income.

Expenses  The Company incurred no property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to property operating expenses of $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
