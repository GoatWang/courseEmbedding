LISLE, Ill., May 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P. (NYSE:    SXCP) announced today that it and its wholly owned subsidiary, SunCoke Energy Partners Finance Corp. ("Finance Corp." and together, the "Issuers"), have priced a downsized private offering to eligible purchasers of $630 million aggregate principal amount of 7.50% senior unsecured notes due 2025 (the "Senior Notes"). SXCP expects to close the sale of the Senior Notes on May 24, 2017, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The Senior Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by all of SXCP's current subsidiaries (other than Finance Corp.) and certain of its future subsidiaries. 








SXCP intends to use the net proceeds received from this offering, together with borrowings under a new revolving credit facility and cash on hand, to fund the purchase of its 7.375% senior notes due 2020 ("2020 Senior Notes") in a tender offer (the "Tender Offer") and repay borrowings outstanding under its existing revolving credit facility, term loan and promissory note.  The Tender Offer is being made pursuant to an Offer to Purchase dated May 16, 2017. To the extent that the Tender Offer is not completed or the net proceeds of this offering, together with borrowings under a new revolving credit facility and cash on hand, exceed the amount needed to fund the Tender Offer and repay borrowings outstanding under SXCP's existing revolving credit facility, term loan and promissory note, SXCP may use the remaining net proceeds from the offering for general partnership purposes, which may include redeeming or otherwise repurchasing 2020 Senior Notes. 
The Senior Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the securities laws of any state and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Senior Notes may be resold by the initial purchasers pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. This press release is being issued pursuant to Rule 135c under the Securities Act. 
This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the Senior Notes nor shall there be any sale of the Senior Notes in any jurisdiction in which the offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSSome of the statements included in this press release constitute "forward-looking statements."  Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and may be identified by the use of such words as "believe," "expect," "plan," "project," "intend," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "continue," "may," "will," "should" or the negative of these terms or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain and involve significant known and unknown risks and uncertainties (many of which are beyond the control of SXCP) that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, domestic and international economic, political, business, operational, competitive, regulatory, and/or market factors affecting SXCP, as well as uncertainties related to:  pending or future litigation, legislation or regulatory actions; liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations; gains and losses related to acquisition, disposition or impairment of assets; recapitalizations; access to, and costs of, capital; the effects of changes in accounting rules applicable to SXCP; and changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations applicable to SXCP's businesses.
Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, but are based upon the current knowledge, beliefs and expectations of SXCP management, and upon assumptions by SXCP concerning future conditions, any or all of which ultimately may prove to be inaccurate.  The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this press release.  SXCP does not intend, and expressly disclaims any obligation, to update or alter its forward-looking statements (or associated cautionary language), whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise after the date of this press release except as required by applicable law.
SXCP has included in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission cautionary language identifying important factors (but not necessarily all the important factors) that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statement made by SXCP.  For information concerning these factors, see SXCP's Securities and Exchange Commission filings such as its annual and quarterly reports and current reports on Form 8-K, copies of which are available free of charge on SXCP's website at www.suncoke.com. All forward-looking statements included in this press release are expressly qualified in their entirety by such cautionary statements.  Unpredictable or unknown factors not discussed in this release also could have material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

(1)



Pursuant to
General Instruction II.D of Form S-3 and Rule 457(o) under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “ Securities
Act ”), the registration fee is calculated on the
basis of the initial maximum aggregate offering price of
$500,000,000 for all of the securities listed and, therefore, the
table does not specify by each class information as to the amount
to be registered or the proposed maximum offering price per
security.





(2)



This
registration statement covers an indeterminate number or principal
amount of each identified class of securities that may be issued in
primary offerings, or upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any
securities registered hereunder that provide for exercise,
conversion or exchange, which shall have an initial maximum
aggregate offering price not to exceed $500,000,000, exclusive of
accrued interest and dividends, if any. Pursuant to Rule 416 under
the Securities Act, this registration statement also covers such
additional number of securities that may be issuable upon exercise,
conversion or exchange of other securities or that may become
issuable as a result of any stock splits, stock dividends or
similar transactions.





(3)



The
registration fee has been calculated in accordance with Rule 457(o)
under the Securities Act, and is exclusive of accrued interest and
dividends, if any.





(4)



With
respect to debt securities, excludes accrued interest and accrued
amortization of discount, if any, to the date of delivery. If any
debt securities are issued at an original issue discount, then the
offering price of such debt securities shall be equal to any such
greater principal amount due at maturity, such aggregate principal
amount not to exceed $500,000,000 less the value of any securities
previously issued hereunder.





(5)



Warrants
will represent rights to purchase the debt securities, common
stock, or preferred stock being registered hereby. Since the
warrants will provide a right only to purchase such securities
offered hereunder, no additional registration fee is
required.





(6)



Rights will
represent rights to purchase shares of common stock or shares of
preferred stock being registered hereby. Since the rights will
provide a right only to purchase such securities offered hereunder,
no additional registration fee is required.





(7)



Each unit
will be issued under a unit agreement and will represent an
interest in two or more other securities, which may or may not be
separable from one another.





(8)



If a series
of debt securities is guaranteed, such series will be guaranteed by
one or more of the subsidiaries of SunCoke Energy, Inc. No
additional consideration will be received for such guarantees.
Pursuant to Rule 457(n) of the Securities Act, no separate fee is
payable with respect to the guarantees of the debt securities being
registered.

prospectus provides you with a general description of SunCoke
Energy, Inc. and the securities that are registered hereunder that

Any prospectus supplement also may add to, update or change

The

  CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This
prospectus and any prospectus supplement and the documents we
incorporate by reference herein or therein may contain various
“forward-looking statements” and information based upon
management’s beliefs and assumptions and on information

forward-looking statements include known and unknown risks. These
risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control,
include, but are not limited to, the risks set forth under
“Risk Factors” and described in the documents
incorporated by reference into this prospectus and any prospectus
supplement. There also may be other risks that we are unable to

future events or otherwise.

  WHO
WE ARE

This
summary highlights important features of this offering and the
information included or incorporated by reference into this
prospectus. This summary does not contain all of the information
that you should consider before investing in our securities. You
should read the entire prospectus carefully, including the risk
factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on
February 18, 2016 and is incorporated by reference herein, as
well as the risk factors and other information in any other
document incorporated by reference into this prospectus. Unless the
context otherwise requires, references to the “
Company
,” “ we ,” “
our ,” “ us
,” or like terms refer to SunCoke Energy, Inc. and our
subsidiaries.

We are an
independent owner and operator of five cokemaking facilities in the
United States, the operator of a cokemaking facility in Brazil, and
owner of a joint venture interest in cokemaking operations in
India. We also provide coal handling and blending services to third
party customers as well as to our own cokemaking
facilities.

On
January 24, 2013, we completed the initial public offering of
SunCoke Energy Partners, L.P., our master limited partnership (the
“ Partnership ”) subsidiary. Our
consolidated financial statements include the Partnership, which
currently owns all of our coal handling and blending operations,
and holds a 98 percent interest in each of our Gateway, Haverhill
and Middletown cokemaking operations. We currently own the general
partner of the Partnership (consisting of a 2.0 percent ownership
interest and incentive distribution rights), as well as a 56.1
percent limited partner interest in the Partnership. The remaining
41.9 percent interest in the Partnership is held by public
unitholders. We report our business results through the following
four business segments:

 




 



•



 



Domestic
Coke: consists
of our Jewell, Indiana Harbor, Haverhill, Granite City and
Middletown cokemaking and heat recovery operations located in
Vansant, Virginia; East Chicago, Indiana; Franklin Furnace, Ohio;
Granite City, Illinois; and Middletown, Ohio, respectively. Our
domestic cokemaking facilities have the collective nameplate
capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of coke per
year, and use a proprietary low-cost, heat-recovery cokemaking
technology that is environmentally superior to the chemical
by-product recovery technology currently used by most other coke
producers. Each of these facilities produces coke and all
facilities except Jewell and Indiana Harbor recover waste heat,
which is converted to steam or electricity through a similar
production process. Steam is sold to third party customers
primarily pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements.
Electricity is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel
pursuant to energy sales agreements. Coke sales at each of these
domestic cokemaking facilities are made pursuant to long-term
take-or-pay agreements with ArcelorMittal, AK Steel, and U.S.
Steel. Each of the coke sales agreements contains pass-through
provisions for costs incurred in the cokemaking process, including
coal procurement costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke
yields), operating and maintenance expense, costs related to the
transportation of coke to the customers, taxes (other than income
taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation, in addition
to containing a fixed fee.




 




 



•



 



Brazil
Coke: consists
of our operations in Vitória, Brazil, where we operate a
1.7 million tons-per year cokemaking facility for a project
company. The Brazil Coke segment earns income at this cokemaking
facility through (1) licensing and operating fees payable to
us under long-term contracts with the local project company that
will run through at least 2022; and (2) an annual preferred
dividend on our preferred stock investment from the project company
guaranteed by the Brazilian subsidiary of ArcelorMittal.




 




 



•



 



Coal
Logistics: consists
of coal handling and blending service operations owned and operated
through subsidiaries of the Partnership having the collective
capacity to blend and transload more than 40 million tons of
coal annually and has storage capacity of 3 million tons.
These operations are strategically located to reach Gulf Coast,
East Coast, Great Lakes and international ports, and are comprised
Raven Energy LLC, which owns Convent Marine Terminal, one of the
largest export terminals on the U.S. Gulf Coast, located in
Convent, Louisiana; Kanawha River Terminals, located in

Table of
Contents

 




 



Belle,
West Virginia and Catlettsburg, Kentucky; SunCoke Lake Terminal,
LLC, located in East Chicago, Indiana; and Ceredo Liquid Terminal
LLC, located in Ceredo, West Virginia. This business provides coal
handling and blending services to third party steel, electric
utility and coal mining customers, as well as to our own cokemaking
facilities.




 




 



•



 



Coal
Mining: historically
consisted of metallurgical coal mining operations near our Jewell
cokemaking facility, with mines located in Virginia and West
Virginia mined by contractors. On April 6, 2016, we
successfully disposed of substantially all of our coal mining
assets, mineral leases, real estate and a substantial portion of
our mining reclamation obligations to Revelation Energy, LLC
(“ Revelation ”). We retained certain
coal mining assets and liabilities, primarily coal inventory, which
continue to be included in the Coal Mining segment.




We also
own a 49 percent interest in a cokemaking joint venture with VISA
Steel, called VISA SunCoke. VISA SunCoke is comprised of a
440 thousand ton heat recovery cokemaking facility and the
facility’s associated steam generation units in Odisha,
India. In 2015 we impaired our 49 percent investment in VISA
SunCoke to zero, and consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter
of 2015, we no longer include our share of VISA SunCoke in our
financial results.

Our
principal executive offices are located at 1011 Warrenville Road,
Suite 600, Lisle, Illinois 60532, and our telephone number is
(630) 824-1000. Our website is located at

lending money to our subsidiaries; and repurchasing or redeeming
our securities. We may invest funds not required immediately for
such purposes in short-term investment grade securities. The actual
application of proceeds we receive from any particular offering of
securities using this prospectus will be described in the
applicable prospectus supplement relating to such
offering.

We have
computed the ratio of earnings to fixed charges by dividing
earnings by fixed charges. For this purpose, earnings consists of
income from continuing operations before income taxes, plus fixed
charges and amortization of capitalized interest, minus capitalized
interest and non-controlling interest in pre-tax income of
subsidiaries that have not incurred fixed charges. Fixed charges
include interest expensed, amortization of capitalized expenses
related to indebtedness and estimates of interest within rental
expenses.

The ratio
of combined fixed charges and preference dividends for each of
these periods is the same as the ratio of earnings to fixed
charges, because we had no preferred securities outstanding during
the periods.

  DESCRIPTION
OF THE EQUITY SECURITIES

Our
authorized stock consists of:

 




 



•



 



Three
Hundred Million (300,000,000) shares of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of which 64,215,724 shares were
outstanding on November 6, 2016; and




 




 



•



 



Fifty
Million (50,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.01 per share, none of which are outstanding on the date of this
prospectus.




Common
Stock

The
following general description of certain rights of our common stock
does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation,
our amended and restated bylaws and the applicable provisions of
the Delaware General Corporation Law (“ DGCL
”). We will distribute a prospectus supplement with regard to
each issue of common stock. Each prospectus supplement will
describe the specific terms of the common stock offered through
that prospectus supplement.

 




 



•



 



Dividend
Rights. Subject to
the prior dividend rights of holders of our preferred stock,
holders of our common stock from time to time are entitled to
receive dividends as and when declared by our board of directors
out of legally available funds. The declaration and payment of
future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the
discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our
earnings and financial condition, our capital requirements and
those of our subsidiaries, regulatory conditions and considerations
and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant. No
cash dividends will be paid with respect to our common stock for
any period unless dividends for the same period, and any
accumulated but unpaid dividends, with respect to any outstanding
series of our preferred stock having preferential rights with
respect to dividends have been paid.




 




 



•



 



Voting
Rights. Each share
of our common stock entitles the holder thereof to one vote per
share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders,
including the election of directors. Under our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, our
stockholders will not have cumulative voting rights. Because of
this, the holders of a majority of the shares of common stock
entitled to vote in any election of directors can elect all of the
directors standing for election, if they should so
choose.




 




 



•



 



Liquidation
Rights. In the
event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, whether
voluntary or involuntary, the holders of common stock are entitled
to receive, pro rata , our assets which are legally
available for distribution, after payment of all debts and other
liabilities and subject to the prior rights of any holders of
preferred stock then outstanding.




 




 



•



 



Preemptive
Rights. The
holders of our common stock do not have any preemptive right to
purchase our securities.




 




 



•



 



Conversion.
Shares of
our common stock are not convertible into shares of any other class
of capital stock.




 




 



•



 



Miscellaneous.
The issued
and outstanding shares of our common stock are fully paid and
non-assessable. Computershare Trust Company, N.A. serves as the
registrar, transfer agent and cash dividend paying agent for our
common stock.




Preferred
Stock

Our board
of directors is authorized without further stockholder action to
provide for the issuance from time to time of preferred stock in
one or more series and to determine the designations, powers,
rights, preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions
of the preferred stock of each such series, including, without
limitation, voting rights (if any), dividend rights, dissolution
rights, conversion rights, exchange rights and redemption rights
and such other provisions as may be determined by the board of
directors in accordance with Delaware law. The

issuance
of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with
possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among
other things, adversely affect the voting power of the holders of
our common stock.

We will
distribute a prospectus supplement with regard to each particular
series of preferred stock. Each prospectus supplement will describe
the designations, preferences, dividend rates, liquidation rights,
voting rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and such other
provisions determined by our board of directors to apply to the
particular series of preferred stock, including:

 




 



•



 



the
designation of the series, which may be by distinguishing number,
letter or title;




 




 



•



 



the number
of shares of the series, which our board of directors may
thereafter (except where otherwise provided in the certificate of
designation applicable to the series) increase or decrease (but not
below the number of shares of the series then
outstanding);




 




 



•



 



the
amounts payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
series in respect of dividends, and whether such dividends, if any,
will be cumulative or noncumulative;




 




 



•



 



dates at
which dividends, if any, will be payable;




 




 



•



 



the
redemption rights and price or prices, if any, for shares of the
series;




 




 



•



 



the terms
and amount of any sinking fund provided for the purchase or
redemption of shares of the series;




 




 



•



 



the
amounts payable on, and the preferences, if any, of shares of the
series in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company;




 




 



•



 



whether
the shares of the series will be convertible into or exchangeable
for shares of any other class or series, or any other security, of
the Company or any other entity, and, if so, the specification of
such other class or series or such other security, the conversion
or exchange price or prices or rate or rates, any adjustments
thereof, the date or dates at which such shares shall be
convertible or exchangeable and all other terms and conditions upon
which such conversion or exchange may be made;




 




 



•



 



restrictions
on the issuance of shares of the same series or of any other class
or series;




 




 



•



 



the voting
rights, if any, of the holders of shares of the series;
and




 




 



•



 



any other
rights and restrictions applicable to that series of preferred
stock.




The shares
of preferred stock will, when issued against full payment of their
purchase price, be fully paid and non-assessable. The following
description summarizes certain general terms and provisions of the
preferred stock, is not complete and is qualified in its entirety
by reference to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and the applicable
provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

 




 



•



 



Ranking.
All shares
of the same series of preferred stock shall be identical in all
respects, except that each share of a series issued at different
times may differ as to the dates from which dividends on such
shares shall be cumulative. All series of preferred stock shall
rank equally with and be identical in all respects to each other
series, unless otherwise determined by our board of directors. Our
preferred stock shall rank prior to our common stock as to
dividends and upon liquidation, dissolution or winding
up.




 




 



•



 



Dividend
Rights. If you
purchase preferred stock being offered by use of this prospectus
and an applicable prospectus supplement, you will be entitled to
receive, when, as and if declared by our board of directors,
dividends at the rates and on the dates set forth in the prospectus
supplement. Dividend rates may be fixed, variable or both. The
nature, amount, rates, timing and other details of dividend rights
for a series of preferred stock will be described in the applicable
prospectus supplement and will be payable in preference to, or in
such relation to, the dividends payable on any other class or
classes or series of our stock, as described in the applicable
prospectus supplement.

Voting
Rights. The voting
rights of preferred stock of any series being offered will be
described in the applicable prospectus supplement.




 




 



•



 



Liquidation
Rights. In the
event that we liquidate, dissolve or wind-up our affairs, either
voluntarily or involuntarily, holders of our preferred stock will
be entitled to receive liquidating distributions in the amount set
forth in the applicable prospectus supplement, plus accrued and
unpaid dividends, if any, before we make any distribution of assets
to the holders of our common stock or any other class of stock
ranking junior to our preferred stock. If we fail to pay in full
all amounts payable with respect to preferred stock being offered
by us and any stock having the same rank as that series of
preferred stock, the holders of the preferred stock and of that
other stock will share in any distribution of assets in proportion
to the full respective preferential amounts to which they are
entitled. After the holders of each series of preferred stock and
any stock having the same rank as the preferred stock are paid in
full, they will have no right or claim to any of our remaining
assets. For any series of preferred stock being offered by this
prospectus and an applicable prospectus supplement, neither the
sale of all or substantially all of our property or business nor a
merger or consolidation by us with any other corporation will be
considered a dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of our business
or affairs.




 




 



•



 



Redemption.
We may
redeem all or any part of any series of our preferred stock at the
times and redemption prices set forth in the resolutions adopted by
our board of directors providing for the issue of that series. In
the event of a partial redemption, the shares to be redeemed may be
selected by lot or by such other equitable method as our board of
directors in its discretion may determine. The terms, if any, on
which shares of a series of preferred stock being offered may be
redeemed will be described in the applicable prospectus supplement.
The preferred stock of a series may be redeemed in such amount or
amounts, and at such time or times, if any, as may be provided in
respect of that particular series of preferred stock. Preferred
stock may be redeemed by us only to the extent legally permissible.
Unless we default in making payment of the redemption price plus
accrued and unpaid dividends, upon redemption, the redeemed
preferred shares shall cease to be outstanding and the holders
thereof shall cease to be stockholders with respect to such shares
and shall have no interest in or claim against us except the right
to receive the redemption price plus accrued and unpaid dividends.
Conversion rights, if any, of preferred shares called for
redemption shall terminate at the close of business on the business
day prior to the redemption date.




 




 



•



 



Conversion
Rights. The
applicable prospectus supplement will state the terms, if any, on
which shares of a series of preferred stock being offered are
convertible into shares of our common stock or another series of
our preferred stock.




Annual
Stockholders Meeting

Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that annual stockholder
meetings will be held at a date, time and place, if any, as
exclusively selected by our board of directors. To the extent
permitted under applicable law, we may conduct meetings by remote
communications, including by webcast.

Voting

The
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares of our common stock
present, in person or by proxy, at any annual or special meeting of
stockholders and entitled to vote will decide all matters voted on
by stockholders, unless the question is one upon which, by express
provision of law, under our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, or under our amended and restated bylaws, a
different vote is required, in which case such provision will
control.

Anti-Takeover
Effects of our Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws

The
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and amended and restated bylaws and of the DGCL summarized below
may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a
tender offer or takeover attempt that you might consider in your
best interest, including an attempt that might result in

Table of
Contents

your
receipt of a premium over the market price for your shares. These
provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking
to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of
directors, which could result in an improvement of their
terms.

 




 



•



 



Special
Meetings of Stockholders. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that,
subject to the requirements of applicable law and any special
rights of holders of preferred stock, a special meeting of
stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of our board of
directors or by a resolution adopted by a majority of the number of
directors our Board of Directors would have if there were no
vacancies.




 




 



•



 



Stockholder
Action by Written Consent. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that any
action that, under the DGCL, may be taken at any meeting of
stockholders may be taken in lieu of a meeting by written consent
of stockholders if the consent is signed by all of the persons who
would be entitled to vote upon such action at a meeting, or by
their duly authorized attorneys.




 




 



•



 



Removal of
Directors. Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that, subject to the rights of
the holders of any series of preferred stock, directors may be
removed with cause at any time upon the affirmative vote of holders
of at least 80 percent of the voting power of all of the then-
outstanding shares of voting stock, voting together as a single
class.




 




 



•



 



Stockholder
Advance Notice Procedure. Our
amended and restated bylaws establish an advance notice procedure
for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as
directors or to bring other business before an annual meeting of
our stockholders. The amended and restated bylaws provide that any
stockholders wishing to nominate persons for election as directors
at, or bring other business before, an annual meeting must deliver
to our secretary a written notice of the stockholder’s
intention to do so. These provisions may have the effect of
precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the
proper procedures are not followed. We expect that these provisions
also may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a
solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of
directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our
company.




 




 



•



 



Amended
and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws. Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that it
may be amended by both the affirmative vote of a majority of our
board of directors or the affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock then
entitled to vote at any annual or special meeting of stockholders;
provided , however , that specified provisions of our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation may not be
amended, altered or repealed unless the amendment is approved by
the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the
voting power of all of the voting stock, voting together as a
single class, including: the provisions governing the liability and
indemnification of directors; maintenance of certain insurance
coverage; and the requirement for supermajority approval of certain
amendments to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation.




In
addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that our amended
and restated bylaws may be amended, altered or repealed, or new
bylaws may be adopted, by the affirmative vote of a majority of the
board of directors, or by the affirmative vote at a meeting of the
holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our
common stock; provided , however , that the
affirmative vote of the holders of at least 80 percent of the
voting power of all of the voting stock, voting together as a
single class is required to alter, amend, repeal, or adopt
provisions relating to: the right to call a special meeting of
stockholders; advance notice of nominations or other business to be
properly brought before an annual meeting of stockholders; required
vote and procedure for election of directors; setting of a record
date for stockholder action by consent; the number, tenure and
qualification of directors; the removal of directors and filling of
vacancies on the Board of Directors; indemnification of directors
and officers; and amendment of our amended and restated
bylaws.

These
provisions make it more difficult for any person to remove or amend
any provisions in our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that may have an
anti-takeover effect.

Table of
Contents

In
addition, Section 203 of the DGCL prohibits certain
transactions between us and a stockholder who beneficially owns
(together with any affiliates or associates) at least 15 percent of
our outstanding voting shares. This provision could prevent certain
business combinations between such an interested stockholder and us
for a period of up to three years. In addition, our amended and
restated bylaws divide our board of directors into three classes of
directors serving staggered, three-year terms. Vacancies and
newly-created directorships resulting from any increase in the size
of our board may be filled by our board until the next election of
the class for which such director shall have been chosen, even if
the directors then on the board do not constitute a quorum. Members
of our board of directors may only be removed from office by our
stockholders for cause. These provisions could delay or prevent a
change in control or removal of existing management.

Limitations
on Liability

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains
provisions permitted under the DGCL relating to the liability of
directors. These provisions eliminate a director’s personal
liability for monetary damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary
duty, except in circumstances involving: a breach of the
director’s duty of loyalty; acts or omissions not in good
faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing
violation of the law; Section 174 of the DGCL, pertaining to
unlawful dividends; or a transaction from which the director
derives an improper personal benefit. The principal effect of the
limitation on liability provision is that a stockholder will be
unable to prosecute an action for monetary damages against a
director unless the stockholder can demonstrate a basis for
liability for which indemnification is not available under the
DGCL. These provisions, however, should not limit or eliminate our
rights or a stockholder’s right to seek non-monetary relief,
such as an injunction or rescission, in the event of a breach of
fiduciary duty by directors. These provisions do not alter a
director’s liability under federal securities laws. The
inclusion of this provision in our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation may discourage or deter stockholders or management
from bringing a lawsuit against directors for a breach of their
fiduciary duties, even though such an action, if successful, might
otherwise have benefited us and our stockholders. 

Indemnification

Our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires us to
indemnify and advance expenses to our directors and officers to the
fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL and other applicable law,
except in the case of a proceeding instituted by the director or
officer without the approval of our board of directors. Our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we are
required to indemnify our directors and executive officers, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, for all judgments, fines,
settlements, legal fees and other expenses incurred in connection
with pending or threatened legal proceedings because of the
director’s or officer’s positions with us or another
entity that the director or officer serves at our request, subject
to various conditions, and to advance funds to our directors and
officers to enable them to defend against such
proceedings.

We have
entered into an indemnification agreement with each of our
directors. The indemnification agreements provide our directors
with contractual rights to the indemnification and expense
advancement rights provided under our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation, as well as contractual rights to
additional indemnification as provided in the indemnification
agreement.

Exclusive
Forum for Adjudication of Disputes

Our
amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: any
derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our
stockholders by any of our directors, officers or employees; any
action asserting a claim against us, or any of our directors or
officers, arising under the DGCL or (iv) any action asserting
a claim against us, or any of our directors or officers, that is
governed by the internal affairs doctrine. We may consent in
writing to alternative forums. By becoming a stockholder in our
company, you will be deemed to have notice of, and have consented
to, the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation related to choice of forum.

  DESCRIPTION
OF THE DEBT SECURITIES

The Debt
Securities will be either our senior debt securities (“
Senior Debt Securities ”) or our subordinated
debt securities (“ Subordinated Debt Securities
”). The Senior Debt Securities and the Subordinated Debt
Securities will be issued under separate indentures among us, the
Subsidiary Guarantors of such Debt Securities, if any, and a
trustee to be determined (the “ Trustee
”). Senior Debt Securities will be issued under a “
Senior Indenture ” and Subordinated Debt
Securities will be issued under a “ Subordinated
Indenture .” Together, the Senior Indenture and the
Subordinated Indenture are called “ Indentures
.”

The Debt
Securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series.
The particular terms of each series that are offered by a
prospectus supplement will be described in the prospectus
supplement.

Unless the
Debt Securities are guaranteed by our subsidiaries as described
below, the rights of the Company and our creditors, including
holders of the Debt Securities, to participate in the assets of any
subsidiary upon the latter’s liquidation or reorganization,
will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s
creditors, except to the extent that we may ourself be a creditor
with recognized claims against such subsidiary.

We have
summarized selected provisions of the Indentures below. The summary
is not complete. The form of each Indenture has been filed with the
SEC as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this
prospectus is a part, and you should read the Indentures for
provisions that may be important to you. Capitalized terms used in
the summary have the meanings specified in the
Indentures.

General

The
Indentures provide that Debt Securities in separate series may be
issued thereunder from time to time without limitation as to
aggregate principal amount. We may specify a maximum aggregate
principal amount for the Debt Securities of any series. We will
determine the terms and conditions of the Debt Securities,
including the maturity, principal and interest, but those terms
must be consistent with the Indenture. The Debt Securities will be
our unsecured obligations.

The
Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full of all of our Senior Debt (as
defined) as described under “— Subordination of
Subordinated Debt Securities” and in the prospectus
supplement applicable to any Subordinated Debt Securities. If the
prospectus supplement so indicates, the Debt Securities will be
convertible into our common stock.

If
specified in the prospectus supplement respecting a particular
series of Debt Securities, one or more Subsidiary Guarantors
identified therein, will fully and unconditionally guarantee (the
“ Subsidiary Guarantee ”) that series as
described under “— Subsidiary Guarantee” and in
the prospectus supplement. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be an
unsecured obligation of the Subsidiary Guarantor. A Subsidiary
Guarantee of Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated to
the Senior Debt of the Subsidiary Guarantor on the same basis as
the Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinated to our Senior
Debt.

The
applicable prospectus supplement will set forth the initial price
or prices at which the Debt Securities to be issued will be offered
for sale and will describe the following terms of such Debt
Securities:

(1) the
title of the Debt Securities;

(2)
whether the Debt Securities are Senior Debt Securities or
Subordinated Debt Securities and, if Subordinated Debt Securities,
the related subordination terms;

(3)
whether any Subsidiary Guarantor will provide a Subsidiary
Guarantee of the Debt Securities;

(4) any
limit on the aggregate principal amount of the Debt
Securities;

 

12


 


 


Table of
Contents

(5) each
date on which the principal of the Debt Securities will be
payable;

(6) the
interest rate that the Debt Securities will bear and the interest
payment dates for the Debt Securities;

(7) each
place where payments on the Debt Securities will be
payable;

(8) any
terms upon which the Debt Securities may be redeemed, in whole or
in part, at our option;

(9) any
sinking fund or other provisions that would obligate us to redeem
or otherwise repurchase the Debt Securities;

(10) the
portion of the principal amount, if less than all, of the Debt
Securities that will be payable upon declaration of acceleration of
the Maturity of the Debt Securities;

(11)
whether the Debt Securities are defeasible;

(12) any
addition to or change in the Events of Default;

(13)
whether the Debt Securities are convertible into our common stock
and, if so, the terms and conditions upon which conversion will be
effected, including the initial conversion price or conversion rate
and any adjustments thereto and the conversion period;

(14) any
addition to or change in the covenants in the Indenture applicable
to the Debt Securities; and

(15) any
other terms of the Debt Securities not inconsistent with the
provisions of the Indenture.

Debt
Securities, including any Debt Securities that provide for an
amount less than the principal amount thereof to be due and payable
upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof (“
Original Issue Discount Securities ”), may be
sold at a substantial discount below their principal amount.
Special U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to Debt
Securities sold at an original issue discount may be described in
the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition, special U.S.
federal income tax or other considerations applicable to any Debt
Securities that are denominated in a currency or currency unit
other than U.S. dollars may be described in the applicable
prospectus supplement.

Subordination
of Subordinated Debt Securities

The
indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinated Debt Securities will, to
the extent set forth in the Subordinated Indenture with respect to
each series of Subordinated Debt Securities, be subordinate in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of all of our Senior
Debt, including the Senior Debt Securities, and it may also be
senior in right of payment to all of our Subordinated Debt. The
prospectus supplement relating to any Subordinated Debt Securities
will summarize the subordination provisions of the Subordinated
Indenture applicable to that series including:

 




 



•



 



the
applicability and effect of such provisions upon any payment or
distribution respecting that series following any liquidation,
dissolution or other winding-up, or any assignment for the benefit
of creditors or other marshalling of assets or any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings;




 




 



•



 



the
applicability and effect of such provisions in the event of
specified defaults with respect to any Senior Debt, including the
circumstances under which and the periods during which we will be
prohibited from making payments on the Subordinated Debt
Securities; and

Securities of that series and, if the series is issued on a senior
subordinated basis, the definition of Subordinated Debt applicable
to that series.

Table of
Contents

The
prospectus supplement will also describe as of a recent date the
approximate amount of Senior Debt to which the Subordinated Debt
Securities of that series will be subordinated.

The
failure to make any payment on any of the Subordinated Debt
Securities by reason of the subordination provisions of the
Subordinated Indenture described in the prospectus supplement will
not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of
Default with respect to the Subordinated Debt Securities arising
from any such failure to make payment.

The
subordination provisions described above will not be applicable to
payments in respect of the Subordinated Debt Securities from a
defeasance trust established in connection with any legal
defeasance or covenant defeasance of the Subordinated Debt
Securities as described under “— Legal Defeasance and
Covenant Defeasance.”

Subsidiary
Guarantee

If
specified in the prospectus supplement, one or more Subsidiary
Guarantors will guarantee the Debt Securities of a series. Unless
otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement, the following
provisions will apply to the Subsidiary Guarantee of each
Subsidiary Guarantor.

Subject to
the limitations described below and in the prospectus supplement,
the Subsidiary Guarantors will jointly and severally, fully and
unconditionally guarantee the punctual payment when due, whether at
Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all our payment
obligations under the Indentures and the Debt Securities of a
series, whether for principal of, premium, if any, or interest on
the Debt Securities or otherwise (all such obligations guaranteed
by a Subsidiary Guarantor being herein called the “
Guaranteed Obligations ”). The Subsidiary
Guarantors will also pay all expenses (including reasonable counsel
fees and expenses) incurred by the applicable Trustee in enforcing
any rights under a Subsidiary Guarantee with respect to a
Subsidiary Guarantor.

In the
case of Subordinated Debt Securities, a Subsidiary
Guarantor’s Subsidiary Guarantee will be subordinated in
right of payment to the Senior Debt of such Subsidiary Guarantor on
the same basis as the Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinated
to our Senior Debt. No payment will be made by any Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee during any period in which
payments by us on the Subordinated Debt Securities are suspended by
the subordination provisions of the Subordinated
Indenture.

Each
Subsidiary Guarantee will be limited in amount to an amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the Subsidiary
Guarantor without rendering such Subsidiary Guarantee voidable
under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or
fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally.

Each
Subsidiary Guarantee will be a continuing guarantee and
will:

(1) remain
in full force and effect until either (a) payment in full of
all the applicable Debt Securities (or such Debt Securities are
otherwise satisfied and discharged in accordance with the
provisions of the applicable Indenture) or (b) released as
described in the following paragraph;

(2) be
binding upon each Subsidiary Guarantor; and

(3) inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the applicable Trustee, the
Holders and their successors, transferees and assigns.

In the
event that (a) a Subsidiary Guarantor ceases to be a
Subsidiary, (b) either legal defeasance or covenant defeasance
occurs with respect to the series or (c) all or substantially
all of the assets or all of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary
Guarantor is sold, including by way of sale, merger, consolidation
or otherwise, such Subsidiary Guarantor will be released and
discharged of its obligations under its Subsidiary Guarantee
and

the
Indenture without any further action required on the part of the
Trustee or any Holder, and no other Person acquiring or owning the
assets or Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor will be
required to enter into a Subsidiary Guarantee. In addition, the
prospectus supplement may specify additional circumstances under
which a Subsidiary Guarantor can be released from its Subsidiary
Guarantee.

Form,
Exchange and Transfer

The Debt
Securities of each series will be issuable only in fully registered
form, without coupons, and, unless otherwise specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement, only in denominations of $1,000
and integral multiples thereof.

At the
option of the Holder, subject to the terms of the applicable
Indenture and the limitations applicable to Global Securities, Debt
Securities of each series will be exchangeable for other Debt
Securities of the same series of any authorized denomination and of
a like tenor and aggregate principal amount.

Subject to
the terms of the applicable Indenture and the limitations
applicable to Global Securities, Debt Securities may be presented
for exchange as provided above or for registration of transfer
(duly endorsed or with the form of transfer endorsed thereon duly
executed) at the office of the Security Registrar or at the office
of any transfer agent designated by us for such purpose. No service
charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of
Debt Securities, but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in that
connection. Such transfer or exchange will be effected upon the
Security Registrar or such transfer agent, as the case may be,
being satisfied with the documents of title and identity of the
Person making the request. The Security Registrar and any other
transfer agent initially designated by us for any Debt Securities
will be named in the applicable prospectus supplement. We may at
any time designate additional transfer agents or rescind the
designation of any transfer agent or approve a change in the office
through which any transfer agent acts, except that we will be
required to maintain a transfer agent in each Place of Payment for
the Debt Securities of each series.

If the
Debt Securities of any series (or of any series and specified
tenor) are to be redeemed in part, we will not be required to
(1) issue, register the transfer of or exchange any Debt
Security of that series (or of that series and specified tenor, as
the case may be) during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of mailing of a notice of
redemption of any such Debt Security that may be selected for
redemption and ending at the close of business on the day of such
mailing or (2) register the transfer of or exchange any Debt
Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except
the unredeemed portion of any such Debt Security being redeemed in
part.

Global
Securities

Some or
all of the Debt Securities of any series may be represented, in
whole or in part, by one or more Global Securities that will have
an aggregate principal amount equal to that of the Debt Securities
they represent. Each Global Security will be registered in the name
of a Depositary or its nominee identified in the applicable
prospectus supplement, will be deposited with such Depositary or
nominee or its custodian and will bear a legend regarding the
restrictions on exchanges and registration of transfer thereof
referred to below and any such other matters as may be provided for
pursuant to the applicable Indenture.

Notwithstanding
any provision of the Indentures or any Debt Security described in
this prospectus, no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in
part for Debt Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global
Security in whole or in part may be registered, in the name of any
Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or any
nominee of such Depositary unless:

(1) the
Depositary has notified us that it is unwilling or unable to
continue as Depositary for such Global Security or has ceased to be
qualified to act as such as required by the applicable Indenture,
and in either case we fail to appoint a successor Depositary within
90 days;

Table of
Contents

(2) an
Event of Default with respect to the Debt Securities represented by
such Global Security has occurred and is continuing and the Trustee
has received a written request from the Depositary to issue
certificated Debt Securities;

(3)
subject to the rules of the Depositary, we shall have elected to
terminate the book-entry system through the Depositary;
or

(4) other
circumstances exist, in addition to or in lieu of those described
above, as may be described in the applicable prospectus
supplement.

All
certificated Debt Securities issued in exchange for a Global
Security or any portion thereof will be registered in such names as
the Depositary may direct.

As long as
the Depositary, or its nominee, is the registered holder of a
Global Security, the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may
be, will be considered the sole owner and Holder of such Global
Security and the Debt Securities that it represents for all
purposes under the Debt Securities and the applicable Indenture.
Except in the limited circumstances referred to above, owners of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to
have such Global Security or any Debt Securities that it represents
registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to
receive physical delivery of certificated Debt Securities in
exchange for those interests and will not be considered to be the
owners or Holders of such Global Security or any Debt Securities
that is represents for any purpose under the Debt Securities or the
applicable Indenture. All payments on a Global Security will be
made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the
Holder of the security. The laws of some jurisdictions may require
that some purchasers of Debt Securities take physical delivery of
such Debt Securities in certificated form. These laws may impair
the ability to transfer beneficial interests in a Global
Security.

Ownership
of beneficial interests in a Global Security will be limited to
institutions that have accounts with the Depositary or its nominee
(“ participants ”) and to Persons that
may hold beneficial interests through participants. In connection
with the issuance of any Global Security, the Depositary will
credit, on its book-entry registration and transfer system, the
respective principal amounts of Debt Securities represented by the
Global Security to the accounts of its participants. Ownership of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will be shown only on,
and the transfer of those ownership interests will be effected only
through, records maintained by the Depositary (with respect to
participants’ interests) or any such participant (with
respect to interests of Persons held by such participants on their
behalf). Payments, transfers, exchanges and other matters relating
to beneficial interests in a Global Security may be subject to
various policies and procedures adopted by the Depositary from time
to time. None of us, the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Trustees or the
agents of us, the Subsidiary Guarantors or the Trustees will have
any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
Depositary’s or any participant’s records relating to,
or for payments made on account of, beneficial interests in a
Global Security, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial interests.

Payment
and Paying Agents

Unless
otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement,
payment of interest on a Debt Security on any Interest Payment Date
will be made to the Person in whose name such Debt Security (or one
or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.

Unless
otherwise indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement,
principal of and any premium and interest on the Debt Securities of
a particular series will be payable at the office of such Paying
Agent or Paying Agents as we may designate for such purpose from
time to time, except that at our option payment of any interest on
Debt Securities in certificated form may be made by check mailed to
the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address appears
in the Security Register. Unless otherwise indicated in the
applicable prospectus supplement, the corporate trust office of the
Trustee under the Senior Indenture in The City of New York will
be

designated
as sole Paying Agent for payments with respect to Senior Debt
Securities of each series, and the corporate trust office of the
Trustee under the Subordinated Indenture in The City of New York
will be designated as the sole Paying Agent for payment with
respect to Subordinated Debt Securities of each series. Any other
Paying Agents initially designated by us for the Debt Securities of
a particular series will be named in the applicable prospectus
supplement. We may at any time designate additional Paying Agents
or rescind the designation of any Paying Agent or approve a change
in the office through which any Paying Agent acts, except that we
will be required to maintain a Paying Agent in each Place of
Payment for the Debt Securities of a particular series.

All money
paid by us to a Paying Agent for the payment of the principal of or
any premium or interest on any Debt Security which remains
unclaimed at the end of two years after such principal, premium or
interest has become due and payable will be repaid to us, and the
Holder of such Debt Security thereafter may look only to us for
payment.

Consolidation,
Merger and Sale of Assets

Unless
otherwise specified in the prospectus supplement, we may not
consolidate with or merge into, or transfer, lease or otherwise
dispose of all or substantially all of our assets to, any Person (a
“ successor Person ”), and may not permit
any Person to consolidate with or merge into us, unless:

(1) the
successor Person (if not us) is a corporation, partnership, trust
or other entity organized and validly existing under the laws of
any domestic jurisdiction and assumes our obligations on the Debt
Securities and under the Indentures;

(2)
immediately before and after giving pro forma effect to the
transaction, no Event of Default, and no event which, after notice
or lapse of time or both, would become an Event of Default, has
occurred and is continuing; and

(3)
several other conditions, including any additional conditions with
respect to any particular Debt Securities specified in the
applicable prospectus supplement, are met.

The
successor Person (if not us) will be substituted for us under the
applicable Indenture with the same effect as if it had been an
original party to such Indenture, and, except in the case of a
lease, we will be relieved from any further obligations under such
Indenture and the Debt Securities.

Events of
Default
