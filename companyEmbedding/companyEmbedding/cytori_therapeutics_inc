Access is provided in response to physician requests when no alternative treatment options are available. The source of medicine funding varies by country and may be derived from the government, hospital, insurer, and/or patient.The name ‘Managed Access Program’ is analogous to other terms often used for similar programs such as: named patient, special access, expanded access, early access, early use, compassionate use, single patient IND, treatment IND, special therapeutic, and cohort supply. The names used vary by company, country, program, and regulatory area.Cytori’s Managed Access Program in select countries across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa is intended to provide patients with hand impairment due to scleroderma early access to ECCS-50 therapy. These patients typically are unable to participate in ongoing clinical trials due to a lack of geographic proximity to a trial site.Companies such as Cytori which are authorized to distribute unlicensed medicines via a Managed Access Program are not involved in the patient-doctor relationship. All information regarding patients is controlled under specific privacy and data protection legislation. Cytori can only distribute where permitted to do so and only in response to an unsolicited information or product supply request.Cytori’s Managed Access Program distributor is Idis Limited:Idis House Churchfield Road Weybridge KT13 8D8 United KingdomTel: +44 (0)1932 824 169 Fax:  +44 (0)1932 824 369Email:  customer.services@clinigengroup.com Website:  http://clinigengroup.comPlease note: This contact information is intended for healthcare professionals only.

For example, formulation HABEO™” has been developed for the treatment of the hand dysfunction associated with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.Ongoing TrialsSCLERODERMAThe STAR Trial is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III pivotal clinical trial of 80 patients with impaired hand function from scleroderma in up to 20 US sites. The trial is evaluating the one-year safety and efficacy of a single administration of Cytori Cell Therapy: HABEO™ in patients with scleroderma affecting the hands. More than 90 percent of scleroderma patients have hand involvement, which is typically progressive with substantial pain, blood flow changes, and dysfunction. The primary endpoint of the study is the Cochin Hand Function Score—a validated measure of hand function. Other key efficacy endpoints include assessments of Raynaud ’s phenomenon, and other objective measures of hand function and digital ulcers. After all patients have completed 48 weeks of follow up, patients in the placebo group will be eligible for crossover to the active arm of the trial. Completion of enrollment is anticipated in June 2016.This trial is based on the previously published trial, SCLERADEC I, conducted at Hȏpital de la Conception in France. SCLERADEC I reported significant improvement in hand function, pain, and Raynaud’s severity in patients with scleroderma affecting the hands.1,2,5 Cytori supported this trial in the form of devices, consumables, and training. Cytori is also providing support for SCLERADEC II, a multi-center, controlled study in France.OSTEOARTHRITISCytori has completed ACT-OA, a US IDE Phase IIA/B clinical trial of the ECCO-50 therapeutic in 94 patients with osteoarthritis affecting the knees. The study is examining the safety and efficacy (symptom relief, function, and activity level) of ECCO-50 at multiple time points through 48 weeks. Full data should be available in late 2016.THERMAL BURN AND RADIATION INJURY – BARDA CONTRACTIn December 2012 Cytori was awarded a research and development contract from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a unit within the US Department of Health and Human Services. This contract funds the development of Cytori Cell Therapy™ as a medical countermeasure for thermal burn injury including burns that are complicated by radiation exposure. In 2014, upon achievement of specified development milestones by Cytori, BARDA executed contract Option 1 which funded the second phase of the project. Upon IDE approval by the FDA, BARDA anticipates exercising Option 2 funding which will cover costs associated with execution of a pilot clinical trial.URINARY INCONTINENCECytori has agreed to provide partial support to a planned Japanese investigator/government sponsored trial of Cytori Cell Therapy for male urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy. This trial is based on a previously published2 feasibility trial conducted at Nagoya University in Japan. This trial demonstrated improvements in leakage, urethral closure, and patient quality-of-life assessment in men with urinary incontinence following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer. The primary funding and support of the trial is from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare and Nagoya University.INVESTIGATOR-INITIATED STUDIESBy providing access to Cytori Cell Therapy processing technology in markets where it has class I or CE Mark approval, the Celution® System has become an important research and development tool for physicians. This enables them to study the potential of our technology in Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Medical Ethics Committee (MEC)-approved studies. A number of investigator-led trials have been completed, are in process, for a range of conditions and applications, including the following:Anterior cruciate ligament repairBone repairBurn scarChronic woundsCritical limb ischemiaCryptoglandular and Crohn’s FistulaeErectile DysfunctionMeniscal RepairStress urinary incontinenceScleroderma hand diseaseVocal cord repairOther Clinical TrialsHEART DISEASEPRECISE was a 27 patient safety and feasibility study in Europe designed to evaluate the use of Cytori Cell Therapy in patients with chronic myocardial ischemia. Data from the PRECISE trial indicated the feasibility of obtaining and delivering Cytori Cell Therapy to patients with significant heart disease. The data provided early indications of efficacy that provided the rationale for the ATHENA trials in the US.The ATHENA I and II trials are multi-center, randomized, double-blind safety and feasibility trials to investigate the use of Cytori Cell Therapy in patients with heart failure due to ischemic heart disease. The trials were originally planned to enroll 45 patients each and examine two dosages of Cytori Cell Therapy.The trials incorporated several endpoints, including peak oxygen consumption, perfusion defects, heart failure symptoms, health-related quality of life, left ventricle end-systolic and diastolic volume, and left ventricular ejection fraction at six and 12 months. Enrollment was truncated at 31 patients in 2014 due to a prolonged trial delay in 2014; however, data will be available for review in mid-2016.ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONThe APOLLO Trial was a 14-patient study in Europe designed to assess the safety and feasibility of Cytori Cell Therapy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Enrollment and 36-month patient follow up is complete. The study demonstrated the feasibility of intracoronary injections of Cytori Cell Therapy in STEMI patients and provided the rationale for the ADVANCE trial.The ADVANCE Trial was a 23 patient randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind European trial at four centers and was a follow up to APOLLO. The trial evaluated administration of cell therapy in patients with STEMI. All available data supported the current known safety profile for Cytori Cell Therapy.RESTOREThe RESTORE-2 study was a Phase IV (post-market) European study that evaluated Cytori Cell Therapy for breast deformities post segmental breast resection (lumpectomy) with or without radiation therapy. This prospective, single-arm, open-label, multi-center study enrolled 71 patients with defects ranging from 25-150 mL. The procedure was shown to be safe and well tolerated. The data reported patient and investigator satisfaction (75% and 85% respectively) following cell-enriched fat grafting to treat breast defects post-breast conservation therapy.41 Gabizon A, Shmeeda H, and Barenholz Y (2003) “Pharmacokinetics of pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin: review of animal and human studies” Clin Pharmacokinet. 42(5):419-362 Rafiyath et al. 2012 “Comparison of safety and toxicity of liposomal doxorubicin vs. conventional anthracyclines: a meta-analysis” Exp Hematol Oncol 1:10-19CYTORI NANOMEDICINE™ CLINICAL TRIALSOngoing TrialsATI-0918ATI-0918 is Cytori’s lead nanomedicine product, a generic liposomal formulation of doxorubicin hydrochloride.  Liposomal doxorubicin has been approved by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for several years. The approved drugs are now off-patent. This creates an expedited path for regulatory approval of generic formulations in which clinical trials are targeted at showing “bioequivalence” which means that the drug levels in the blood and tissue following injection of ATI-0918 must be equivalent (using FDA/EMA-specified bioequivalence criteria) to the levels seen when the approved product is injected. Bioequivalence studies typically require only one clinical trial as opposed to the conventional Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III pathway required for new drugs. Bioequivalence of ATI-0918 and the reference listed drug in Europe,  (Caelyx®), has already been demonstrated in a clinical trial. Cytori is now preparing for submission for approval by the EMA. If granted, this approval will allow marketing of ATI-0918 for use in breast cancer and ovarian cancer with the possibility of extending this to both multiple myeloma and Kaposi’s sarcoma. Bioequivalence with the FDA-approved reference listed drug (Lipodox®) in the USA has not yet been performed. ATI-1123ATI-1123, a liposomal formulation of docetaxel, is being developed as a next-generation version of the currently approved product. Docetaxel is approved in the USA for the treatment of a number of cancers including breast cancer, head and neck cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer and non small-cell lung cancer. Use of docetaxel is associated with several side effects including injury to the bone marrow. Cytori believes that by encapsulating docetaxel in a liposome,  ATI-1123 may reduce these side effects. A 29 patient Phase I trial has been completed and published6. This published data suggests that the toxicity may be less than that reported for non-encapsulated docetaxel. This will need to be confirmed in larger Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. 6. Mahalingam D, Nemunaitis JJ, Malik L, et al.

Company history[edit]
Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. is a late stage cell therapy company developing autologous cell therapies from adipose tissue to treat a variety of medical conditions. The company was created as the result of a 2002 merger between Macropore Biosurgery Inc. (founded in 1996) and StemSource Inc. (founded in 2000). The joint company operated under the Macropore name until 2005 when it changed its name to Cytori Therapeutics. Cytori is headquartered in San Diego, CA, and also has operations in Japan and the United Kingdom.
Core technology: the Celution System[edit]
Cytori develops cellular therapeutics formulated for specific diseases and medical conditions. Clinical development programs are currently targeting impaired hand function in scleroderma (Phase III clinical), osteoarthritis of the knee (Phase II clinical), and thermal burn injury (preclinical phase).
Cytori’s cellular therapeutics are collectively known as Cytori Cell TherapyTM, and consist of different formulations of a heterogeneous population of cells (including stem cells) that are involved in response to injury, repair and healing. This cell therapy product is prepared from a patient’s own adipose (fat) tissue using the company’s fully automated Celution® System that disaggregates adipose tissue and liberates the entrapped stem and regenerative cells that naturally reside in native adipose. The system formulates a cell therapy product that is available for delivery to the patient within 1–2 hours of tissue collection.
Cytori’s lead indication is currently in a US phase III, FDA approved, pivotal study, the STAR TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02396238), designed to evaluate one administration of Cytori’s ECCS-50 in treating impaired hand and finger function from scleroderma. The STAR Trial initiated June 2015, completed enrollment of 88 patients in June 2016 and Cytori anticipates follow up data to be available mid-2017.[1] The company has also recently completed a US, FDA approved, Phase II study, ACT-OA TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02326961), to examine ECCO-50 safety, feasibility, and dosing in the treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.[2] Preliminary data was released Q2 2016.[3]
Cosmetic and reconstructive surgery[edit]
The Celution System was introduced into the European and Asia-Pacific cosmetic and reconstructive surgery market in 2008. Since that time, physicians in Europe and Japan have been using ADRCs to enrich fat grafts for a number of cosmetic applications including breast reconstruction, breast augmentation, facial rejuvenation and buttock augmentation, among others.
RESTORE I[edit]
RESTORE I was an independent Japanese study that examined reconstruction of partial mastectomy breast defects using ADRCs isolated using the Celution System. The 21 patient study was found to be safe and well tolerated in all patients. The study showed a high (79%) level of patient satisfaction with the final outcome.[4]
RESTORE 2[edit]
Following the promising results of RESTORE I, Cytori launched its own European breast reconstruction post-marketing study, named RESTORE 2, in June 2008. The 70 patient study was designed to assess patient and physician satisfaction, improvement in overall breast deformity, imaging, quality of life, and safety among other measures. The study completed enrollment in November 2009, with all patients to be followed up at both six and 12 months.
Six month interim results on 32 patients were presented at the 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 12, 2009. In addition to reinforcing the safety of the procedure, the RESTORE 2 study showed that 73% of patients and 82% of physicians were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.[5]
Fat grafting[edit]
In addition to Celution, Cytori developed the Puregraft System which allows the physician to wash and purify the fat tissue before reinjection into the same patient, standardizing the fat graft preparation process.
Cytori received a 510(k) for market clearance of the Puregraft System in January 2010 for use in aesthetic body contouring using autologous fat grafts.[6] In addition to the Puregraft System, Cytori has developed the Celbrush, a precision fat graft delivery tool.
Cardiovascular disease[edit]
Cytori is sponsoring two European safety and feasibility studies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease using ADRCs extracted using the Celution System.
APOLLO[edit]
Cytori’s APOLLO study was designed to evaluate the use of ADRCs in the treatment of patients who have undergone myocardial infarctions. In March 2009, the study’s Steering Committee and the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) deemed that the safety and feasibility goals of the study had been met after the enrollment of 14 patients. Primary outcomes for the study will be assessed at the six month follow up. The ADRC therapy resulted in a reduction in infarct size by 60%, and significant improvement of LV perfusion (MIBI SPECT) and an improvement of left ventricular function by 6% at 6 month followup. At 36 months FU, the improvement on infarct size persisted, as well as the effect LV function. A progressive improvement of cardiac remodelling was noted.
PRECISE[edit]
Cytori’s PRECISE study evaluates the use of ADRCs to treat patients suffering from chronic myocardial ischemia. Enrollment in the trial was completed in May 2009 with the enrollment of 27 patients. Primary outcomes of the study will be assessed at six months.
StemSource and stem cell banking[edit]
Cytori has also developed StemSource, automated laboratory equipment for tissue processing and cell extraction system for research use. The StemSource equipment is available worldwide.
Stem cell banking[edit]
In addition to use in laboratory research, StemSource is the centerpiece of Cytori’s StemSource Cell Bank platform for cryopreservation and storage of a patients’ adult stem and regenerative cells (ADRC’s). The StemSource Cell Bank allows hospitals and companies to offer their patients the option of harvesting, preparation and storage of their adipose tissue or their processed ADRC’s.
Once the adipose tissue is extracted and prepared using the StemSource equipment, the storage technology freezes the tissue/cells at -196 degrees Celsius, which drastically slows the metabolism of the cells, preventing future aging or deterioration and preserving them for potential future use, should clinical applications be approved by governmental authorities.
Other research and applications[edit]
The Celution System is being used in Japan and Europe as tool for independent investigation and development of additional therapeutic uses of ADRCs.
Some of these investigations include stress urinary incontinence, wound healing, liver insufficiency, renal failure and peripheral artery disease.

Company history[edit]
Cytori Therapeutics, Inc. is a late stage cell therapy company developing autologous cell therapies from adipose tissue to treat a variety of medical conditions. The company was created as the result of a 2002 merger between Macropore Biosurgery Inc. (founded in 1996) and StemSource Inc. (founded in 2000). The joint company operated under the Macropore name until 2005 when it changed its name to Cytori Therapeutics. Cytori is headquartered in San Diego, CA, and also has operations in Japan and the United Kingdom.
Core technology: the Celution System[edit]
Cytori develops cellular therapeutics formulated for specific diseases and medical conditions. Clinical development programs are currently targeting impaired hand function in scleroderma (Phase III clinical), osteoarthritis of the knee (Phase II clinical), and thermal burn injury (preclinical phase).
Cytori’s cellular therapeutics are collectively known as Cytori Cell TherapyTM, and consist of different formulations of a heterogeneous population of cells (including stem cells) that are involved in response to injury, repair and healing. This cell therapy product is prepared from a patient’s own adipose (fat) tissue using the company’s fully automated Celution® System that disaggregates adipose tissue and liberates the entrapped stem and regenerative cells that naturally reside in native adipose. The system formulates a cell therapy product that is available for delivery to the patient within 1–2 hours of tissue collection.
Cytori’s lead indication is currently in a US phase III, FDA approved, pivotal study, the STAR TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02396238), designed to evaluate one administration of Cytori’s ECCS-50 in treating impaired hand and finger function from scleroderma. The STAR Trial initiated June 2015, completed enrollment of 88 patients in June 2016 and Cytori anticipates follow up data to be available mid-2017.[1] The company has also recently completed a US, FDA approved, Phase II study, ACT-OA TRIAL (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02326961), to examine ECCO-50 safety, feasibility, and dosing in the treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee.[2] Preliminary data was released Q2 2016.[3]
Cosmetic and reconstructive surgery[edit]
The Celution System was introduced into the European and Asia-Pacific cosmetic and reconstructive surgery market in 2008. Since that time, physicians in Europe and Japan have been using ADRCs to enrich fat grafts for a number of cosmetic applications including breast reconstruction, breast augmentation, facial rejuvenation and buttock augmentation, among others.
RESTORE I[edit]
RESTORE I was an independent Japanese study that examined reconstruction of partial mastectomy breast defects using ADRCs isolated using the Celution System. The 21 patient study was found to be safe and well tolerated in all patients. The study showed a high (79%) level of patient satisfaction with the final outcome.[4]
RESTORE 2[edit]
Following the promising results of RESTORE I, Cytori launched its own European breast reconstruction post-marketing study, named RESTORE 2, in June 2008. The 70 patient study was designed to assess patient and physician satisfaction, improvement in overall breast deformity, imaging, quality of life, and safety among other measures. The study completed enrollment in November 2009, with all patients to be followed up at both six and 12 months.
Six month interim results on 32 patients were presented at the 32nd Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on December 12, 2009. In addition to reinforcing the safety of the procedure, the RESTORE 2 study showed that 73% of patients and 82% of physicians were satisfied with the outcome of the procedure.[5]
Fat grafting[edit]
In addition to Celution, Cytori developed the Puregraft System which allows the physician to wash and purify the fat tissue before reinjection into the same patient, standardizing the fat graft preparation process.
Cytori received a 510(k) for market clearance of the Puregraft System in January 2010 for use in aesthetic body contouring using autologous fat grafts.[6] In addition to the Puregraft System, Cytori has developed the Celbrush, a precision fat graft delivery tool.
Cardiovascular disease[edit]
Cytori is sponsoring two European safety and feasibility studies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease using ADRCs extracted using the Celution System.
APOLLO[edit]
Cytori’s APOLLO study was designed to evaluate the use of ADRCs in the treatment of patients who have undergone myocardial infarctions. In March 2009, the study’s Steering Committee and the data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) deemed that the safety and feasibility goals of the study had been met after the enrollment of 14 patients. Primary outcomes for the study will be assessed at the six month follow up. The ADRC therapy resulted in a reduction in infarct size by 60%, and significant improvement of LV perfusion (MIBI SPECT) and an improvement of left ventricular function by 6% at 6 month followup. At 36 months FU, the improvement on infarct size persisted, as well as the effect LV function. A progressive improvement of cardiac remodelling was noted.
PRECISE[edit]
Cytori’s PRECISE study evaluates the use of ADRCs to treat patients suffering from chronic myocardial ischemia. Enrollment in the trial was completed in May 2009 with the enrollment of 27 patients. Primary outcomes of the study will be assessed at six months.
StemSource and stem cell banking[edit]
Cytori has also developed StemSource, automated laboratory equipment for tissue processing and cell extraction system for research use. The StemSource equipment is available worldwide.
Stem cell banking[edit]
In addition to use in laboratory research, StemSource is the centerpiece of Cytori’s StemSource Cell Bank platform for cryopreservation and storage of a patients’ adult stem and regenerative cells (ADRC’s). The StemSource Cell Bank allows hospitals and companies to offer their patients the option of harvesting, preparation and storage of their adipose tissue or their processed ADRC’s.
Once the adipose tissue is extracted and prepared using the StemSource equipment, the storage technology freezes the tissue/cells at -196 degrees Celsius, which drastically slows the metabolism of the cells, preventing future aging or deterioration and preserving them for potential future use, should clinical applications be approved by governmental authorities.
Other research and applications[edit]
The Celution System is being used in Japan and Europe as tool for independent investigation and development of additional therapeutic uses of ADRCs.
Some of these investigations include stress urinary incontinence, wound healing, liver insufficiency, renal failure and peripheral artery disease.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
