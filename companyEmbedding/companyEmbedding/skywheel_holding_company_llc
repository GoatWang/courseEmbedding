Officials with Clayton-based Koch Development are close to finalizing an $18.5 million equity financing that will go toward funding three new Ferris wheel projects.
Koch, which has a real estate portfolio of more than 1 million square feet of retail, office and industrial space, got into the Ferris wheel business in 2011 when it built a 200-foot-plus observation wheel in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.

SkyWheel Holding Company LLC, a business entity of Koch’s, reported raising $1.5 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission earlier this month. Matthew Stack, Koch’s managing director, said he’s received commitments from investors for nearly all the remaining $17 million. Investors were not disclosed, but Stack said the group includes individuals from Koch Development, members of the Koch family, executives and board members of Koch Development, and friends and other network connections with ties to Koch Development.
The money is being used to build new Ferris wheels — SkyWheels, as Koch brands them — in Newport, Ohio, and Panama City, Florida, as well as a third in an undisclosed location.
Each wheel will cost between $10 million and $15 million.




Koch claims to be the first company to bring an observation wheel to the United States. Observation-style Ferris wheels, which typically feature luxury-style gondolas, have been trending across the globe since the London Eye, built on the south bank of the River Thames in London, was constructed in 1999 for $76.7 million.
“They’ve always been very prevalent in Europe where there are large pedestrian tourist attractions,” Stack said. “A Ferris wheel is a natural complement to any tourist attraction or high-pedestrian traffic area,” he said. “If there’s a great view to see, it lends itself to a movable observation wheel, which appeals to a wide demographic.”
Stack declined to disclose revenue for Koch or its SkyWheel unit. He said the SkyWheel in Myrtle Beach sees about 500,000 riders each year, each of whom pay between $9 and $50 per ticket.
Koch’s development team for the new wheels includes Dutch Wheels, a manufacturer of wheel equipment based in The Netherlands; Cincinnati-based Bruce D. Robinson Design Group, the design planner; Thelen Associates Inc., the geotechnical engineer; and Woolpert, engineer and architect.

The new wheels will be developed and operated by Koch Development.




 


The Newport wheel will take advantage of tourists already visiting attractions such as the Ohio Riverfront, Newport on the Levee district and Newport Aquarium.
“The SkyWheel will be an exciting addition to Newport on the Levee, one of northern Kentucky’s most successful visitor attractions,” Eric Summe, president and CEO of Northern Kentucky Convention and Visitors Bureau, said in a statement.
Ferris fight
Koch Develompent isn’t the only company looking to tap into the Ferris wheel industry.
Lodging Hospitality Management (LHM) plans a 200-foot-tall Ferris wheel as part of a larger $70 million upgrade at St. Louis Union Station that will also include an aquarium. LHM has owned Union Station since 2012.
Bob O’Laughlin, chairman and CEO of LHM, said he expects the Union Station wheel to record about 500,000 riders per year. “A Ferris wheel will fit in nicely with the attractions we have planned,” O’Laughlin said, noting the aquarium as well as a fire show on the Union Station pond and train rides to places such as St. Louis’ wine country and Chicago for a Chicago Cubs/St. Louis Cardinals baseball game. “We think the whole combination makes for a great family attraction and with everything we’ve done at Union Station, we believe it will be a destination.”
East on Market Street, Tony Sansone Jr., owner of Sangita, a real estate private equity firm, reportedly wants to put a Ferris wheel on the old Mike Shannon’s property, just north of Ballpark Village.
O’Laughlin, who owns the 25-story Hilton at the Ballpark next door to the old Shannon’s, has cried foul at the potential addition.
“I have $100 million invested in that property,” O’Loughlin previously told the Business Journal. “Anything that goes up will damage our business and operation as far as guests checking into the hotel.”
The Sangita Ferris wheel, if built, would also “damage and put in peril” the Union Station Ferris wheel, he said.
Chuck Billings, who represents Sansone’s Sangita, would not say what could be developed at the site, which Sangita has under contract. “It remains to be seen what the developers would or could use the property for,” Billings said.
