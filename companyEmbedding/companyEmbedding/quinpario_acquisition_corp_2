The Notes are being issued to finance, in part, the pending business combination of SourceHOV, LLC, ("SourceHOV"), Novitex Holdings, Inc.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.  This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.

About Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2
Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2 intends to focus in the specialty chemicals and performance materials industries in which the partnership has experienced significant global success. Initial focus is to acquire companies with an enterprise value between $700 million and $2 billion.



	Quinpario successfully utilized this process with its first special purpose acquisition company to acquire Jason Industries, Inc. in June 2014, a mere 11 months after its initial public offering, which resulted in gross proceeds of $172,500,000, inclusive of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option in full. Quinpario’s stockholders overwhelmingly approved the acquisition of Jason, with 89 percent of the shares voting, 100 percent of which were voted in favor of the transaction, allowing for the swift completion of the business. In excess of 85 percent of the amount initially placed into trust remained in trust at the closing.

Affiliates of Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2 Announce Proposed Notes Offering
























NEW YORK, Jun 19, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) --


                                        








Quinpario Acquisition Corp. 2  ("Quinpario"), a publicly traded special purpose acquisition company, announced today that its subsidiaries, Exela Intermediate LLC (the "Issuer") and Exela Finance Inc. (the "Co-Issuer"), are proposing to issue $525.0 million aggregate principal amount of first-priority senior secured notes due 2023 (the "Secured Notes") and $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2024 (the "Unsecured Notes" and, together with the Secured Notes, the "Notes") in a marketed private offering (the "Offering") that will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The Notes are being issued to finance, in part, the pending business combination of SourceHOV, LLC, ("SourceHOV"), Novitex Holdings, Inc. ("Novitex") and Quinpario pursuant to which SourceHOV and Novitex will each become subsidiaries of the Issuer (the "Business Combination"), and certain related transactions that were previously disclosed in the preliminary proxy statement filed by Quinpario with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 3, 2017. The Business Combination is expected to close in July 2017.        









In the Offering, the Notes are being offered only to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act, and outside the United States, only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S.  The Notes will not be registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an effective registration statement or an applicable exemption from registration requirements or a transaction not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act or any state securities laws.


                                        








This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale in any jurisdiction in which such offering, solicitation or sale would be unlawful.  This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act.

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.
