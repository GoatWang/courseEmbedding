Vanguard Personal Advisor Services Review 2017

Advisors, Investing






Vanguard has maintained its standing as the leading broker-launched online advisory offering, even as other online brokers have thrown their hats into the ring. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services manages an impressive $47 billion in assets, combining human financial advisors with robo-advisor technology to charge 0.3% for account management.
Vanguard Personal Advisor Services uses primarily Vanguard funds and requires an account minimum of $50,000, the highest of any of the online advisors we’ve reviewed. All clients get access to Vanguard’s financial advisors, but those with balances of $500,000 or more get their own dedicated advisor.

Customer supportClients with account balances under $500,000 have access to a team of Vanguard financial advisors. Clients with assets of $500,000 or more get their own dedicated advisor. 





Where Vanguard Personal Advisor Services shines
Low management fee: Is a 0.3% management fee low in the grand scheme of robo-advisors? Not really. Wealthfront charges a flat 0.25% on balances over $10,000 and manages the portion under $10,000 free. Other services, like Schwab Intelligent Portfolios and WiseBanyan, are free of management costs altogether — though as with all robo-advisors, the investments carry expense ratios paid by the investor.
But it may be more reasonable to compare Vanguard’s fees with similar hybrid services like Betterment and Personal Capital. Vanguard comes in lower there: Betterment charges 0.40% for its service that is most similar to Vanguard, offering unlimited access to a team of financial advisors. Personal Capital charges 0.89% for accounts up to $1 million. Compared with that — and the 1% or greater fee typically charged by a financial advisor — Vanguard’s management fee is reasonable.
However, Personal Capital clients get access to one or two dedicated financial advisors, depending on their account balance. Vanguard provides a dedicated advisor only to clients with $500,000 or more. Under that amount, clients have access to a team of over 100 advisors but won’t work with the same one regularly.
Investments: Vanguard Personal Advisor Services builds portfolios on a client-by-client basis, using primarily Vanguard funds. In many ways, that benefits investors. Vanguard funds carry some of the lowest expense ratios available, and many competitor robo-advisors also use them as the base of their portfolios. However, it allows Vanguard to line its pockets twice; once with the management fee and again with fund expense ratios, which range from 0.05% to 0.19%.
Unlike other robo-advisors, Vanguard’s service doesn’t exclusively use exchange traded funds. Portfolios are primarily constructed of index funds and, in some cases, actively managed funds. Vanguard says its advisors will incorporate ETFs if the client wants to use them, and clients also can include a money market fund for access to liquidity. Core portfolio holdings include Admiral Shares of Vanguard’s total stock market index fund, total bond market index fund, international stock market index fund, international bond market index fund, and limited-, intermediate- and long-term tax-exempt funds, which invest in municipal bonds.
Comprehensive management: Vanguard Personal Advisor Services directly manages brokerage and individual retirement accounts, as well as trusts. But the advisors will also take into account other aspects of a client’s portfolio, like a 401(k), college savings plans or even accounts held at another firm, when developing a financial plan. It’s up to you to tell your advisor about those assets, and they won’t be managed directly by Vanguard advisors. But the advice you get will be comprehensive and fitting of your full financial picture.
Financial advisors: Part of the value in hiring a financial advisor is that you have someone to turn to when life gets stormy, whether that means the markets have taken a dive or you’re experiencing personal turbulence. An advisor will help you adjust your plan, if needed, or remind you that your plan is sound and you just need to ride out the waves. Likewise, an advisor can help you plan for and adjust to major milestones, like a marriage or the birth of a child.
Vanguard Personal Advisor Services does that, too, though it does it best for clients with $500,000 or more. Only at that asset level do you get a dedicated advisor, something we found the company’s website fails to make clear.
At lower account balances, you’ll work with Vanguard’s band of advisors rather than one person assigned to your account. The advisors will help you adjust your investments as needed and send you quarterly progress reports. You can schedule time to speak to an advisor via phone or video conferencing, and advisors are also available for quick questions via email.
Where Vanguard Personal Advisor Services falls short
Account minimum: There’s no way around this: $50,000 is a high account minimum. It’s clear Vanguard is limiting its service to balances that, given the low management fee, will make a significant impact on its bottom line. The minimum puts the service out of reach for many new investors, though that minimum can be spread among multiple accounts. The company adds another layer with the $500,000 minimum to access a dedicated financial advisor.
Possible transaction fees: Many robo-advisors swallow the cost of any transaction fees incurred in client accounts, such as trade commissions and mutual fund load or sales charges. (Expense ratios typically are passed on to the investor.) These fees are generally minimal in robo-advisor accounts, which primarily use ETFs and index funds. But Vanguard’s service does use other investments in some cases, and the advisor’s service brochure notes that the client is subject to any transaction fees, brokerage charges, sales charges, commissions or other fees and expenses that stem from the purchase of non-Vanguard investments. The company notes that it typically recommends no-load mutual funds and Vanguard funds.
Tax-loss harvesting: The service is available here, but it isn’t automatic. Rather, tax-loss harvest opportunities are approached on a client-by-client basis, which the company says is by design. Vanguard’s investment research shows that while tax-loss harvesting can be beneficial, it also carries risk. Clients who want daily monitoring for tax-loss harvesting opportunities may not be happy with this approach.
Vanguard does allocate assets across account types, optimizing for taxes. For example, tax-efficient investments will be placed in taxable accounts, and those that generate a tax burden will go into tax-sheltered retirement accounts, when the client has both types of account. This is similar to Betterment’s Tax-Coordinated Portfolio.
Is Vanguard Personal Advisor Services right for you?
Compared with robo-advisors, Vanguard Personal Advisor Services is on the pricey side, with a high account minimum. But this service is more than a robo-advisor, offering personalized financial planning and financial advisors to clients.
It’s an excellent choice for investors who can meet the account minimum and want to use the computer algorithms of a robo-advisor while maintaining access to a human touch. If you have the $500,000 balance required to get your own dedicated financial advisor, you’ll be able to extract even more value from the 0.3% management fee.

Advisory business
Vanguard Advisers, Inc. ("VAI"), is a Pennsylvania corporation that provides investment advisory services to a wide variety of clients. VAI was incorporated in and has been in business since 1995. VAI is 100% owned by Goliath, Inc., a Delaware corporation. As such, VAI is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of The Vanguard Group, Inc. ("Vanguard"), the sponsor and manager of the Vanguard family of mutual funds, comprising The Vanguard Group of Investment Companies (the "Vanguard Funds"), which VAI typically recommends as investments.
VAI provides investment advisory services through various interactive advice products and tools.
Advisory questionnaires
VAI has developed certain educational questionnaires designed for investors in state-sponsored 529 plans that may invest in Vanguard Funds. Users can refer to a brochure to obtain asset allocation suggestions, which are based on the user's answers to a questionnaire designed to gauge their risk tolerance, investment experience, and time horizon.
The brochure suggests asset allocation models of stocks, bonds, and short-term reserves, along with, in some cases, portfolios of Vanguard Funds or non-Vanguard funds available through the users' state-sponsored 529 plan that can be used to implement the suggested allocations. The brochure does not provide comprehensive investment advice. The asset allocation suggestions may be limited to certain asset classes and may not be appropriate for other assets held by the investor.
Personal Online Advisor
VAI offers Personal Online Advisor ("POA") to clients who want access to online investment advice. In order to provide investment recommendations through POA, VAI relies exclusively on the proprietary software, systems, and methodology developed and maintained by Financial Engines Advisors LLC ("Financial Engines"), an independent investment advisor unaffiliated with VAI.
Financial goal forecasting. POA generates a forecast, or estimate, of the client's chance of reaching his or her financial goals. Forecasts are based on information in our systems including:

Current account balance(s).
Current savings or contribution rates.
Time horizon (i.e., years until goal).
Investment goals (i.e., desired account balance at the end of the time horizon).

The forecasts generated by POA are reasonable estimates based on information supplied by clients and are not guarantees of future results. Reliance on historical and current data necessarily involves certain inherent limitations.

Investment recommendations. POA provides specific buy-and-sell recommendations to help allocate assets among a limited selection of investments (generally, Vanguard Funds and other investment company securities) available for investment. In the case of eligible retirement plans, the plan's sponsor selects the investments available to accounts using the POA service.
Account reviews and monitoring. POA enables clients to review their accounts, monitor progress toward their financial goals, receive forecasts and investment recommendations, and access educational materials. Although POA updates the values of most mutual funds and stocks in a client's accounts daily, it is the client's responsibility to review and update accounts to adjust for significant changes in investments or personal circumstances.

POA does not recommend allocations of individual stocks, even if they are available for investment in a client's account. POA does not select the investment alternatives available for investment in a participant's account. By recommending allocations among the available investments, POA does not endorse the selection of particular investments as available investments for a participant's account.
POA will not take into consideration any favorable tax treatment on a participant's company stock investment when providing advice.
VAI only offers nondiscretionary investment advice through POA. Clients have no obligation to accept any suggestions provided by POA and neither VAI, Vanguard, nor Financial Engines is authorized to make decisions regarding clients' accounts or investments. Since VAI does not provide ongoing discretionary or nondiscretionary account management services through the POA service, it does not track its assets under management.
The interactive advice tools do not provide ongoing discretionary or nondiscretionary account management services and therefore do not track assets under management.
Fees and compensation
There is no charge to use the online advisory questionnaires. In addition, Vanguard clients do not pay a fee to use POA.
The advice provided by VAI will include recommendations to sell, hold, or purchase Vanguard Funds. The purchase or sale of Vanguard Funds through Vanguard (whether or not suggested by the interactive advice tools) is not subject to a load, sales charge, or commission. However, each Vanguard Fund incurs advisory, administrative, and custodial fees, as well as other fees and expenses that it pays out of its own assets. The advisory, administrative, custodial, and other costs make up the funds' expense ratios. Also, some Vanguard Funds impose purchase and redemption fees. Clients that are invested in Vanguard investments are subject to the applicable expense ratios and any purchase and redemption fees. Thus, acting in accordance with VAI's advice to purchase Vanguard Funds will result in the payment of fees to the Vanguard Funds, in addition to any advisory fees assessed by VAI. Please consult the funds' prospectuses for information about a specific fund's expense ratio.
Participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans for which Vanguard provides recordkeeping services often are permitted to invest in non-Vanguard mutual funds. Because the advice provided by VAI may include recommendations to hold or purchase non-Vanguard mutual funds, acting in accordance with such advice may result in payments to Vanguard as compensation for participant-level recordkeeping and administrative services provided by Vanguard for such funds. This payment may be made by the fund company sponsoring the non-Vanguard mutual fund, by the plan sponsor, or by the participant investing in the non-Vanguard mutual fund.
The purchase or sale of third-party fund shares through Vanguard may be subject to a load or sales charge, although VAI generally recommends the purchase of no-load mutual funds. Additionally, participant account assets that are invested in third-party mutual funds indirectly bear the annual fund operating expenses charged by those mutual funds. A fund's expenses are detailed in the fund's prospectus. If POA recommends the purchase or sale of non-Vanguard investments, clients may incur additional fees, including transaction fees, brokerage charges, loads, sales charges, expense ratios, commissions, markups, or other fees or expenses. In addition, Vanguard or its affiliates may receive other compensation, including asset-based sales charges, service fees, revenue-sharing payments, 12b-1 fees, or other fees, in connection with such investments. VAI does not take into consideration whether Vanguard or any of its affiliates would receive fees from its recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell non-Vanguard investments.
Performance-based fees and side-by-side management
VAI does not receive performance-based fees for use of the advisory questionnaires or interactive advisory tools by clients.
Types of clients
The advisory questionnaires are offered to investors in state-sponsored 529 plans that may use Vanguard Funds. VAI offers POA to clients, including retirement plan participants, who want access to online investment advice. POA is made available to retirement plan participants in plans approved by the plan sponsor. POA is available as a complimentary service to investors with $50,000 or more in assets at Vanguard.
Methods of analysis, investment strategies, and risk of loss
VAI generally recommends investments in mutual funds and investment company securities. Although VAI will recommend investment strategies designed to be prudent and diversified, please remember that all investments, including mutual funds and investment company securities, involve some risk, including possible loss of principal. Be aware that fluctuations in the financial markets and other factors may cause declines in the value of your account. There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market. There is no assurance that you will achieve positive investment results by using VAI services. VAI cannot guarantee the future performance of your investments. Please consult the funds' prospectuses for more information about fund-specific risks.
POA
POA offers investment advice based on an investment methodology developed by Financial Engines. POA uses Financial Engines' proprietary software to analyze historical and current returns, volatility, cross-correlations, and other factors to develop individualized target allocation recommendations. The Financial Engines software employs returns-based style analysis and optimization, among other techniques, to develop its target allocation recommendations. The main sources of information analyzed include historical returns for mutual funds, individual securities, and broad asset categories (e.g., large-capitalization U.S. equity returns, money market returns, foreign equity returns, etc.), security-specific information (such as mutual fund expense ratios), and current market data and information.
POA generates a forecast through the use of simulations, which are hypothetical economic scenarios based on analysis of historical and current returns, volatility, cross-correlations, and other factors. POA creates thousands of hypothetical future economic scenarios to evaluate how account investments might perform under a variety of circumstances, including changing interest rates, inflation, and market conditions. The forecast is a percentage figure representing the number of scenarios in which the clients' accounts would be sufficient to meet or exceed their investment goals at the end of the time horizon. POA also can include information about stock options in a financial goal forecast.
For more detailed information on Financial Engines and its investment methodology, please go to financialengines.com for a copy of its brochure.
Disciplinary information
VAI has no disciplinary information to disclose.
Other financial industry activities and affiliations
There are no individual investment advisors providing advice directly to clients. All output provided to users of the tools is based on user input and systematic models and allocations.
The Vanguard Group, Inc.
VAI is 100% owned by Goliath Inc., a Delaware corporation, which is wholly owned by Vanguard. Vanguard, also a registered investment adviser, provides a range of investment advisory and administrative services to the Vanguard Funds. The Vanguard Group is truly a mutual mutual fund company. It is owned jointly by the funds it services and thus indirectly by the shareholders in those funds. POA may recommend the purchase of Vanguard Funds serviced by Vanguard. Because the advice provided by POA may include recommendations to hold or purchase Vanguard Funds, acting in accordance with such advice will subject the participant to the expense ratios charged by any Vanguard Funds held in the investor's account, as well as any purchase or redemption fees assessed by those Vanguard Funds.
Vanguard Marketing Corporation
Shares of the Vanguard Funds are marketed and distributed by Vanguard Marketing Corporation ("VMC"), a registered broker-dealer that is a wholly owned subsidiary of Vanguard, and an affiliate of VAI. VMC's marketing and distribution services are conducted on an at-cost basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of a 1981 exemptive order from the SEC, which permits Vanguard Funds to internalize and jointly finance such activities. Each Vanguard Fund (other than a fund of funds) or each share class of a Fund (in the case of a fund with multiple share classes) pays its allocated share of VMC's marketing costs. VMC does not receive transaction-based compensation in connection with the distribution of the Vanguard Funds.
When giving advice to clients, VAI will recommend the purchase of Vanguard Funds distributed by VAI's affiliate, VMC. Since VMC performs its marketing and distribution services on an at-cost basis and does not receive transaction-based compensation in connection with the distribution of the Vanguard Funds, no competing interests arise from VAI's affiliation with VMC. Certain members of VAI's management are registered representatives of VMC.
Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company
VAI is also affiliated with Vanguard Fiduciary Trust Company ("VFTC"), a limited-purpose trust company incorporated under the banking laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and a wholly owned subsidiary of Vanguard. VFTC serves as trustee and investment advisor for certain collective investment funds and collective investment trusts offered by Vanguard as eligible investment options by some retirement plans. POA may recommend the purchase of Vanguard collective investment trusts serviced by VAI's affiliate, VFTC.
Financial Engines Advisors LLC
The Vanguard Group has engaged Financial Engines Advisors LLC ("Financial Engines") to provide subadvisory services to POA. Financial Engines is an independent, third-party, federally registered investment advisor that does not sell investments or receive commission for the investments it recommends.
Code of Ethics, participation or interest in client transactions, and personal trading
VAI operates under a Code of Ethics that complies with Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and Rule 204A-1 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
The Code sets forth fiduciary standards that apply to all employees, incorporates Vanguard's insider trading policy, and governs outside employment and receipt of gifts. Additionally, the Code restricts the personal securities trading of Vanguard employees, as well as reporting requirements. The trading restrictions and reporting requirements are more involved for employees that have access to information about Vanguard Fund trading activity or Vanguard client trading activity and are designed to ensure that Vanguard employees do not misuse Vanguard Fund or client information for their own benefit.
Vanguard will provide a free copy of its Code of Ethics to any client or prospective client upon request.
Please see Other financial industry activities and affiliations for a discussion of VAI's affiliations with other Vanguard entities and how those affiliations may impact clients of VAI.
Brokerage practices
The interactive advice tools, including POA, do not provide recommendations on individual securities. VAI does not select or recommend broker-dealers for client transactions in connection with these services.
Review of accounts
The interactive advice tools do not provide ongoing monitoring or reviews of accounts with the exception of the POA service.
POA reviews accounts in accordance with the forecasting and monitoring services mentioned above.
As owners of Vanguard Fund shares, VAI clients will receive or have access to communications with respect to those Vanguard Funds. These communications include transaction confirmations, quarterly account statements, prospectus updates, annual and semiannual reports, and proxy statements relating to their Vanguard Fund holdings (as appropriate), as well as general Vanguard newsletters, e-mails, and other communications.
Client referrals and other compensation
VAI receives no economic benefits from persons who are not clients for providing investment advice or advisory services to its clients.
VAI does not directly or indirectly compensate any person who is not a supervised person for client referrals.
Custody
VAI does not have custody of client funds or securities through the interactive advice tools. The Vanguard Group, Inc., in its capacity as the transfer agent of the Vanguard Funds, sends quarterly, or more frequent, account statements directly to VAI clients. Clients should carefully review these account statements and contact Vanguard with any questions.
Investment discretion
The interactive advice tools are intended to be point-in-time advisory services that provide recommendations to users based on user input. These tools do not exercise discretion over user accounts. POA does not have discretion over clients' accounts.
Voting client securities
Under these services, VAI will not vote or exercise similar rights for client securities. For participants in employer-sponsored retirement plans, the responsibility for the exercise of all voting or similar rights associated with any security or other property held in the portfolio shall be outlined by the plan. The exercise of all voting rights associated with any security or other property held in the portfolio shall be the responsibility of the client. VAI will not advise or act for the client in any legal proceedings, including bankruptcies or class actions, involving securities held or previously held by the portfolio or the issuers of those securities. Proxies will be delivered to the client by the issuer of the security, the custodian, or its agent.
Financial information
VAI is not aware of any financial condition that is reasonably likely to impair its ability to meet contractual commitments to clients.
Requirements for state-registered advisors
VAI is a federally registered investment advisor.

REFERENCE CONTENT




Layer opened.Read the transcript







Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing. Important information All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss. For more information about Vanguard funds or Vanguard ETFs, visit vanguard.com, or call 877-662-7447, to obtain a prospectus. Investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses, or other important information are contained in the prospectus; read and consider it carefully before investing. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.
