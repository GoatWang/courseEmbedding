SHANGHAI, July  20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. (the "Company") (Nasdaq:   OSN), a China-based manufacturer of an array of plain surface, rare earth and zinc coated pre-stressed steel materials, today announced that it has entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with America-Asia Diabetes Research Foundation (the "Foundation"), a California corporation that owns 90.27% of the equity interests of San MediTech (Huzhou) Co. Ltd. ("San MediTech"), a China-based medical device company engaged in the research, development and marketing of glucose control products, and the shareholders of the Foundation (the "Selling Shareholders"). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Company has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the Foundation in exchange for up to 81,243,000 of the Company's ordinary shares (the "Acquisition").








Transaction Details
Upon completion of the Acquisition, the Company will indirectly own 90.27% of San MediTech. San MediTech's proprietary Dynamic Glucose Monitoring System ("DGMS") provides continuous, real-time monitoring of glucose level in diabetes patients.
In addition, the Company entered into an agreement (the "Spin-Off Agreement") to spin-off its existing pre-stressed steel manufacturing business, including all existing liabilities, immediately following the completion of the Acquisition. Pursuant to the Spin-Off Agreement, an entity affiliated with Dr. Liang Tang, Chairman of the Company, will acquire all of the equity of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, which indirectly owns all of the Company's existing operating subsidiaries, in exchange for the forfeiture and cancellation of all 11,850,000 ordinary shares of the Company currently held by Dr. Tang (the "Spin-off Transaction"). 
An aggregate of 28,095,454 of the Company's shares will be deposited in escrow at the closing of the Acquisition including (i) 24,372,900 of such shares (the "earn-out shares") subject to forfeiture in the event that the post-combination company fails after the closing to achieve RMB 44 million of revenue in 2017 and (ii) an additional 3,722,554 of such shares subject to forfeiture in the event that the Company's representative under the Exchange Agreement  successfully brings an indemnification claim under the Exchange Agreement on behalf of the Company's shareholders.
It is anticipated that, following completion of the Acquisition and the Spin-Off (collectively, the "Transactions"), the Company's existing shareholders (excluding Dr. Tang) will retain an ownership interest of approximately 8.9% of the Company (or approximately 12.25% in the event that the earn-out shares are forfeited), current members of the Company's management or affiliates of the Company (excluding Dr. Tang) will own approximately 1.35% (or approximately 1.85% in the event that the earn-out shares are forfeited), and the selling shareholders of AADRF will own approximately 91.10%, of the outstanding equity of the Company (or approximately 87.75% in the event that the earn-out shares are forfeited). 
The Transactions are subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including shareholder approvals and the Company's continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Transactions are expected to close promptly following the Company's special shareholders' meeting to approve the Transactions.  
The description of the Transactions contained herein is only a summary and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Exchange Agreement and the Spin-Off Agreement, copies of which will be filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") as exhibits to a Report on Form 6-K.

Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. Key Developments

Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. Announces Unaudited Consolidated Financial Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
Jun 30 17
Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. announced unaudited consolidated financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported revenues decreased by $4.5 million, or 15.0%, to $25.6 million from $30.1 million for the same period of last year. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales from both coated products and plain surface and other products. Operating income decreased by $1.0 million, or 67.2%, to $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $1.5 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in operation income was primarily attributable to decrease in gross profit and partially offset by decrease in general and administrative expenses in 2017. Net income decreased by $0.5 million, or 82.3%, to $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $0.6 million for the same period of last year. Earnings per share, both basic and diluted, were $0.003 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.023 for the same period of last year. Net cash used in operating activities was $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $0.8 million for the same period of last year.


Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. Announces Consolidated Earnings Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Ended December 31, 2016
Apr 10 17
Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. announced consolidated earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2016. For the year, the company reported revenue was $117,029,154 against $117,908,416 a year ago. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreases in sales from zinc coated products and plain surface PC strands and other products and partially offset by increased sales from rare earth coated products. Income from operations was $8,986,084 against $10,245,631 a year ago. Income before income tax was $6,249,530 against $7,793,573 a year ago. Net income attributable to the company and subsidiaries was $4,823,973 against $5,896,804 a year ago. Basic and diluted EPS was $0.24 against $0.30 a year ago. Net cash provided by operating activities was $15,528,845 compared to $12,441,861 a year ago. This increase in cash provided by operating activities was the result of a $1.3 million decrease in inventories due to higher consumption of raw materials at the end of 2016, a $9.0 million decrease in advance to suppliers due to less prepayments for raw materials of plain surface and zinc coated products, partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease in net income due to higher operating expenses and a $7.3 million increase in notes receivable because customers used less cash for payment. Purchase of plant and equipment was $17,537 against $29,687 a year ago.

Ossen Innovation - Net Current Asset Value Bargain - Ossen Innovation Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ:OSN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ossen Innovation - Net Current Asset Value BargainFeb.28.17 | About: Ossen Innovation (OSN) Amaresh Gautam Deep Value, value, special situations, growth at reasonable priceBook reviewsSummaryOSN is selling below its net current asset value which is a proxy for liquidating value.
        OSN is selling for less than the debt it can completely service.
        OSN has negligible long term debt.
        Ossen Innovation company limited (NASDAQ:OSN) currently has $137 million of current assets on its balance sheets. If you deduct from this number, all current and long term liabilities of $43 million you will be left with a value of $94million which is substantially more than the current market capitalization of approximately $14.7 million. This net current asset value of $94 million (which is current assets - current liabilities - non current liabilities) is a proxy for liquidating value of the company. This means that $94 million can be generated by liquidating the company if we assume that non current assets of $9 million, are worth nothing. The fact that the company is selling below its liquidation value is fundamentally illogical. It is also selling for less than its debt capacity. Average operating earnings of the company over the last five year period has been 6.66. Suppose company wanted to issue debt on the basis of its operating earnings. Let us say that an interest coverage ratio of 3 would make it a safe bet. The company can service interest of 2.22 (6.66/3) from its operating earnings. Assuming that the cost of debt capital is 10% on after tax basis, 22.22 million of debt (2.22/ 0.1) can be comfortably serviced by the company from its operating earnings. Logically a company cannot be worth less than the debt it can comfortably service. OSN can for example raise $22 million debt, and give a special dividend of $22 million. The natural question that follows from the above facts, is why is the company selling so cheap. The answer lies in an unsatisfactory trend of earnings and earnings per share which has declined from $1.74 to $0.42 over the last five year period. The company's cash flow from operating has been negative for two years in the past five year period.
 The primary question that has to be answered is can OSN be counted to remain a going concern for foreseeable future, during which three things can happen 1. A turnaround in company's trends of earnings, 2. An acquisition by another major player and 3. A possible liquidation of the company (a rather remote possibility). It is also preferable to invest in a product company rather than a service company when investing in Net-Nets (which is what stocks quoting below Net current asset values are called) as many more things are likely to go wrong with a service offering rather than a product. Ossen Innovation Co Ltd manufactures & sells an array of plain surface prestressed steel materials & rare earth coated & zinc coated prestressed steel materials. Its materials are used in construction of bridges, highways & other infrastructure projects. The company is only one of the four companies in China capable of producing coated prestressed steel products. The company also has a cost advantage due to access to low cost river transport. Top 6 customers account for 80% of the revenue. Similarly, purchases from five largest suppliers amounted to 99.1%, 95.1% and 91.6% of raw material purchases in the years ended December 31,2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The company's principal raw material is high carbon steel wire rods, whose prices are cyclical. The company may not be able to pass the price increase to its customers, because large customers will have large bargaining power. The chairman of the company Dr. Tang owns 60% of the outstanding shares, which may limit the possibility of value getting unlocked by acquisitions and activist investors. The company is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 5.3 and price to sales ratio of 0.1. The deep discount from liquidating value, and debt capacity makes OSN an undervalued stock. While the concentration of suppliers and customers makes company somewhat risky, it is likely to remain important in its industry for some time. One should be prepared to hold the stock for a period of 3 to 5 years in his or her portfolio, which should be adequately diversified (a basket of similar value stocks would do). At the current price of close to $2.23 the downside seems limited.
