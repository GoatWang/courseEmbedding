Mutual funds are subject to risks and fluctuate in value.   Federated GNMA Trust reorganized into Federated Government Income Trust on January 23, 2015.    Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their prices.   The value of some mortgage-backed securities may be particularly sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates, and although the securities are generally supported by some form of government or private insurance, there is no assurance that private guarantors or insurers will meet their obligations.   Past performance is no guarantee of future results.   These pages include general information and have not been tailored for any specific recipient or recipients. Accordingly, these pages are not intended to cause Federated or any affiliate to become a fiduciary within the meaning of Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended or Section 4975(e)(3)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.    "Category" product classifications noted at the top are Federated's internal classifications.   Investors should carefully consider the fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing.
