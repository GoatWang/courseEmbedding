Core Strategy
Will Wurm




 Q2 2017 : Improving Economic Backdrop
Summary: The second quarter of 2017 provided modest positive returns in the domestic equity markets with the S&P 500 up approximately 2.5% for the quarter bringing the year to date gain to 9%. The U.S. economy continues on its muted path with ongoing gains in consumer spending and business fixed investment paired with elevated business optimism.

Aggressive Growth Strategy
John Preston




 Q2 2017 : “Rhyming the Reagan Era”
Summary: Markets look forward and not unsurprisingly in the wake of a “joyless bull market” in recent years, markets are now encouraged by the prospect of a business-friendly environment with lower taxes and fewer stifling regulations like the Reagan Era. To many observers, the period before us looks like 1982 and the recent past bears a strong resemblance to the period from 1968 to 1982. While history doesn�t repeat itself exactly, it does, as Mark Twain quipped, “rhyme.”

How Your Assets Are Protected
Beech Hill Securities’ Clearing Firm and SIPC Coverage



The assets in our clients’ accounts are protected both by Beech Hill Securities, Inc., and our clearing agent, Pershing LLC, a subsidiary of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation.
Pershing, a leading provider of financial business solutions for over 75 years, serves many of the world’s most respected financial organizations, and remains focused on the segregation, safekeeping, servicing, and reporting of clients’ assets in their custody. Pershing is well capitalized with capital ratios exceeding those required by regulators. Please refer to Pershing’s Statement of Financial Condition at www.pershing.com for additional information.
The financial strength of Beech Hill and Pershing provides the first measure of protection for our clients’ assets. Beech Hill and Pershing are each registered broker-dealers with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Both the SEC and FINRA require us to comply with various rules intended to minimize the chance of financial failure and maximize the protection of our clients’ assets.
The SEC Customer Protection Rule requires Pershing to segregate investor assets, which are fully paid-for from its own assets. Therefore, in the unlikely event of the financial failure of Pershing, investor’s fully paid-for assets will remain separate from Pershing’s own assets. Beech Hill and Pershing are also subject to the SEC Net Capital Rule, which requires each of us to maintain enough liquid assets in the event of firm failure and liquidation. Because Pershing has custody of our clients’ assets, it must maintain an even higher level of net capital than Beech Hill, further increasing the security of our clients’ assets.


Beech Hill and Pershing are also members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a non-profit organization that provides coverage to investors if their brokerage firm becomes insolvent. It covers the replacement of missing securities and cash up to $500,000 (including a maximum of $250,000 for claims for uninvested cash awaiting reinvestment). In addition to SIPC protection, Pershing provides coverage in excess of SIPC limits.*
Neither SIPC nor excess of SIPC coverage protects against loss due to market fluctuation of investments. Account protection applies when a SIPC member firm fails financially and is unable to meet obligations to securities clients, but it does not protect against losses from the rise and fall in the market value of investments.
*For more detailed information, please visit www.pershing.com/strength_stability.html and www.sipc.org.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Avon Products (NYSE:AVP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 2 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.40)Consensus Price Target: $5.90 (59.46% upside)
