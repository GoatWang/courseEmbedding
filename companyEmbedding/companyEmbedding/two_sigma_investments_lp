Colin Beirne Colin directs Two Sigma Ventures’ investing efforts, having spent his career on the business side of technology companies and initiatives. He joined Two Sigma in 2005 to focus on strategy and business development, and helped plan and execute the growth of the company’s primary business lines and manage key partnerships. In 2007, he began making orthogonal investments for Two Sigma, and in 2011 began building Two Sigma Ventures. Colin started his career in New York as a technology investment banker just after the bursting of the dot-com bubble. A Bay Area native, he fondly recalls summer internships at San Francisco startups in the late 90s, and was first drawn to New York City for a summer at Doubleclick. Colin graduated with a dual B.A. in Economics and Law, Jurisprudence, and Social Thought from Amherst College. He is on the Board of Directors of Harlem Prep Charter School.

Prior to joining the company, Wray was a senior managing director with Marathon Asset Management, L.P., where he developed and led the company’s private equity business and a number of other new business opportunities, investor-related activities and capital formation initiatives. Prior to Marathon, Wray worked as a director with Fox Paine & Company, LLC and as a principal with Dubilier & Company, LLC.

In 2000, Matt joined colleagues from Bell Labs at Entrisphere, Inc. in California. Entrisphere created a product providing access equipment for broadband service providers. During his tenure there, he was lead developer and manager for a number of systems on the network element.

Later that year, Edward joined D. E. Shaw & Co. in London, where he directed research into new quantitative investment strategies before moving to the firm’s New York office in 1998.

Two Sigma Investments LP is a New York City-based hedge fund that uses a variety of technological methods, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and distributed computing, for its trading strategies.[2][3] The firm is run by John Overdeck and David Siegel.[4][2][3]

History[edit]
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by John Overdeck, David Siegel and Mark Pickard.[3][5] The company's main office is in New York City. It also has branch offices in Houston, London, and Hong Kong.[6] According to Two Sigma, the firm's name "Two Sigma" was chosen to reflect the duality of the word sigma. A lower case sigma, σ, designates the volatility of an investment's return over a given benchmark, and an upper case sigma, Σ, denotes sum. By adding together the volatilities of individual positions measured against the benchmark, Two Sigma can amplify forecast signals, the company's website says.[7]
The fund managed around $8 billion in November 2011, $23 billion in October 2014, and $32 billion by the end of 2015.[8][3][9][10]
In October 2013, Two Sigma Private Investments announced that it was joining with Stephen Hannahs to form Wings Capital Partners, a commercial aviation private equity, investment, advisory and financing company.[11] In July 2014, it was announced that Simon Yates, Citigroup's global head of equity derivative sales and trading, left the bank to join Two Sigma.[12]
Fund information[edit]
Two Sigma has been noted in the business press for its unusually high rate of return, comparable to its older and more mature competitors D. E. Shaw & Co. and Renaissance Technologies.[3][13] In October 2014, Two Sigma had raised $3.3 billion for a macro hedge fund in one of the largest new pools of such capital raised since the 2008 financial crisis.[9]
There are a few specialized divisions:

Two Sigma Private Investments (Two Sigma Pi) focuses on private equity, credit and special opportunities, real estate, real assets and natural resources, and venture capital.[14]
Two Sigma Ventures focuses on venture capital investments in companies, with a focus on companies operating in the realm of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.[15]
Two Sigma Advisers LLC manages money for pension plans, sovereign funds, and other institutional clients.[9]
Two Sigma Securities LLC is a high frequency broker-dealer.

People[edit]
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by John Overdeck, and David Siegel.[3][5] Co-founder David Siegel is a computer science Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and held the position of Chief Information Officer for D. E. Shaw & Co. prior to starting Two Sigma. The other co-founder, John Overdeck, is an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist who subsequently studied mathematics and then rose to the position of Managing Director at D. E. Shaw prior to leaving to co-found Two Sigma.[16]
Mark Pickard served as the President of the firm from its inception until his retirement in 2006.[7]
Controversies[edit]
Accessing and duplicating confidential information[edit]
In February 2014, Forbes reported that former Two Sigma employee Kang Gao, age 29, was prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney and is accused of using a remote-access device to view Two Sigma's proprietary trading models and emailing this information to his personal email account, lifting quantitative trading strategies, trading models, a marketing presentation, and a scientific white paper.[17] The case is New York. v. Kang Gao. Gao spent 8 months in jail as of October 2014.[17] In February 2015, Gao pleaded guilty to “illegally accessing and duplicating proprietary and confidential information related to the firm’s trading methods.” [18] [19]

History[edit]
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by John Overdeck, David Siegel and Mark Pickard.[3][5] The company's main office is in New York City. It also has branch offices in Houston, London, and Hong Kong.[6] According to Two Sigma, the firm's name "Two Sigma" was chosen to reflect the duality of the word sigma. A lower case sigma, σ, designates the volatility of an investment's return over a given benchmark, and an upper case sigma, Σ, denotes sum. By adding together the volatilities of individual positions measured against the benchmark, Two Sigma can amplify forecast signals, the company's website says.[7]
The fund managed around $8 billion in November 2011, $23 billion in October 2014, and $32 billion by the end of 2015.[8][3][9][10]
In October 2013, Two Sigma Private Investments announced that it was joining with Stephen Hannahs to form Wings Capital Partners, a commercial aviation private equity, investment, advisory and financing company.[11] In July 2014, it was announced that Simon Yates, Citigroup's global head of equity derivative sales and trading, left the bank to join Two Sigma.[12]
Fund information[edit]
Two Sigma has been noted in the business press for its unusually high rate of return, comparable to its older and more mature competitors D. E. Shaw & Co. and Renaissance Technologies.[3][13] In October 2014, Two Sigma had raised $3.3 billion for a macro hedge fund in one of the largest new pools of such capital raised since the 2008 financial crisis.[9]
There are a few specialized divisions:

Two Sigma Private Investments (Two Sigma Pi) focuses on private equity, credit and special opportunities, real estate, real assets and natural resources, and venture capital.[14]
Two Sigma Ventures focuses on venture capital investments in companies, with a focus on companies operating in the realm of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.[15]
Two Sigma Advisers LLC manages money for pension plans, sovereign funds, and other institutional clients.[9]
Two Sigma Securities LLC is a high frequency broker-dealer.

People[edit]
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by John Overdeck, and David Siegel.[3][5] Co-founder David Siegel is a computer science Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and held the position of Chief Information Officer for D. E. Shaw & Co. prior to starting Two Sigma. The other co-founder, John Overdeck, is an International Mathematical Olympiad Silver Medalist who subsequently studied mathematics and then rose to the position of Managing Director at D. E. Shaw prior to leaving to co-found Two Sigma.[16]
Mark Pickard served as the President of the firm from its inception until his retirement in 2006.[7]
Controversies[edit]
Accessing and duplicating confidential information[edit]
In February 2014, Forbes reported that former Two Sigma employee Kang Gao, age 29, was prosecuted by the Manhattan District Attorney and is accused of using a remote-access device to view Two Sigma's proprietary trading models and emailing this information to his personal email account, lifting quantitative trading strategies, trading models, a marketing presentation, and a scientific white paper.[17] The case is New York. v. Kang Gao. Gao spent 8 months in jail as of October 2014.[17] In February 2015, Gao pleaded guilty to “illegally accessing and duplicating proprietary and confidential information related to the firm’s trading methods.” [18] [19]

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
