 Harvesting and Squeezing 
  
 Oranges 
  are hand-picked in the field, loaded into trailers and delivered to the processing 
  plant. Oranges do not ripen after picking and the deterioration process begins 
  as soon as they are separated from the tree. The fruit is dumped from trailers 
  onto conveyers where it is carried through a washing process. The fruit is then 
  graded, and oranges not acceptable for processing are separated and diverted 
  to be used for by-products. The U.S. Dept. of Agriculture (USDA) then tests 
  for juice and solids content, the unit of payment for growers, after which the 
  oranges are diverted to storage bins labeled according to juice specifications 
  represented by each tested load of fruit. Oranges are then selected from labeled 
  bins to enable blending juice of optimal quality and transported via conveyor 
  to juicing machines (extractors). After juice extraction, the stream of pulpy 
  juice goes through a finisher (screen) where the pulp and seeds are removed, 
  and along with the peel, diverted to be used for by-products. At this stage, 
  the juice is made into one of two product forms: bulk frozen concentrated orange 
  juice (FCOJ) or not-from-concentrate (NFC). 
 Bulk FCOJ 
 Juice 
  made into bulk FCOJ is sent to an evaporator where vacuum and heat are used 
  to remove excess water in order to obtain a base concentrate of 65° brix, 
  which is a seven-to-one strength ratio to normal single-strength juice. The 
  bulk FCOJ is then stored at 20°F or lower in a tank farm or in 55-gallon 
  drums until it is sold or packaged for sale. 
 NFC 
 Juice 
  made into NFC is de-oiled to .02%-.04% oil levels with a centrifuge, then either 
  pasteurized, chilled and packaged or stored for future sale and/or packaging. 
  NFC is stored a number of ways: frozen as blocks in warehouses; frozen in 55-gallon 
  drums; pasteurized and chilled in large stainless steel aseptic tanks; or, pasteurized 
  and chilled in 4'x4' wooden boxes containing a plastic bag which holds about 
  300 gallons of juice. 
 Canned FCOJ 
 Bulk 
  FCOJ is packaged by orange juice marketers into either frozen concentrated orange 
  juice or chilled reconstituted (recon) ready-to-serve (RTS) orange juice. Packaged 
  FCOJ is made by adding single-strength juice or water and flavor oils and essences 
  to bulk FCOJ to reduce it from 65° brix to 42° brix, which is a four-to-one 
  strength ratio to normal single-strength juice. Then the product is packaged 
  into 6-, 12-, or 24-oz. cans and sold in frozen form. To convert this FCOJ into 
  ready-to-drink orange juice, consumers thaw it and then mix it with three parts 
  water. 
 Recon 
  RTS 
 Recon 
  RTS is made by adding water and flavor oils and essences to bulk FCOJ to reduce 
  it from 65° brix to 11.8° brix, pasteurizing it, packaging it in cardboard 
  cartons or glass containers and selling it as chilled RTS orange juice.

I agree with everything that the previous reviewer wrote. She looked exactly like the pictures on the website. She also did everything as promised. She stayed in character even when talking to me! She was so patient even when the crowd of kids practically mobbed her while she was doing face painting. She made each kid feel special. I highly recommend Party Princess Productions. Fair price for what they deliver!Maeghan F.Tustin, CAMagical!!!Amazing company! I hired Belle for my daughter's 3rd birthday party! She was speechless! All of the little princesses attending the party were captivated by Belle. She was beautiful and stayed in character the entire time. She read a story and sang in between. Great voice! She taught the girls how to be a princess and danced around with them to princess music. She really made the birthday girl feel special and all of the other mommies were impressed too! I highly recommend this company and will definitely use them again for our next celebration!Annie S.Redondo Beach, CABest Yo Gabba Gabba Show! :)We had a lady named Susana who came as Ariel. All the girls loved her and she looked just like the little mermaid ! I was running a little late so she couldn't start right away, but she offered to stay 30 minutes over time just to paint faces and take pictures with everyone, no extra charge. I will definitely be using this company again for my son's 1st birthday next year.Diamond E.Long Beach, CAAreas We ServiceParty Princess Productions' services are available in (but not limited to) the following areas:
